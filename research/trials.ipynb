These dynamic changes will allow us to use technology in new ways \\nas quickly as we can learn them. The interface of medicine and technology will help us \\nprovide better, safer care with each passing year as the amazing advancements of our scientist \\ncolleagues further delineate the pathophysiology and mechanisms of diseases. Our goal as \\nthe editors and authors of this textbook is not only to provide the classic, foundational \\nknowledge we use every day, but to include recent advances in a readable, searchable, and \\nconcise text for medical learners as they move toward their careers as physicians and advanced \\npractice providers.\\nWe have once again provided updated information, including the advances that have \\noccurred since the last edition. We believe this integration will help you investigate the \\ncommon and classic pediatric disorders in a time-honored, logical format, helping you to \\nboth acquire knowledge and apply knowledge to your patients. The authors again include \\nour colleagues who serve as clerkship directors so that medical students and advanced \\npractice providers can gain the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in caring for \\npatients and in preparing for clerkship or in-service examinations.\\nWe are honored to be part of the journey of the thousands of learners who rotate through \\npediatrics and of those who will become new providers of pediatric care in the years to come.\\nKaren J.

Marcdante\\nCHAPTER 1 \\nPopulation and Culture\\nCARE OF CHILDREN IN SOCIETY\\nHealth care professionals need to appreciate the interactions \\nbetween medical conditions and social, economic, and envi -\\nronmental influences associated with the provision of pediatric \\ncare. New technologies and treatments improve morbidity, \\nmortality, and the quality of life for children and their families, \\nbut the costs may exacerbate disparities in medical care. The \\nchallenge for pediatricians is to deliver care that is socially \\nequitable; integrates psychosocial, cultural, and ethical issues \\ninto practice; and ensures that health care is available to all \\nchildren.\\nCURRENT CHALLENGES\\nChallenges that affect children’s health outcomes include access \\nto health care; health disparities; supporting their social, cogni-\\ntive, and emotional lives in the context of families and com -\\nmunities; and addressing environmental factors, especially \\npoverty. Early experiences and environmental stresses interact \\nwith the genetic predisposition of every child and, ultimately, \\nmay lead to the development of diseases seen in adulthood. \\nPediatricians have the unique opportunity to address not only \\nacute and chronic illnesses but also the aforementioned issues \\nand toxic stressors to promote wellness and health maintenance \\nin children.\\nMany scientific advances have an impact on the growing \\nrole of pediatricians. Newer genetic technologies allow the \\ndiagnosis of diseases at the molecular level, aid in the selection \\nof medications and therapies, and may provide information on \\nprognosis. Prenatal diagnosis and newborn screening improve \\nthe accuracy of early diagnosis and treatment, even when a cure \\nis impossible. Functional magnetic resonance imaging allows a \\ngreater understanding of psychiatric and neurologic problems, \\nsuch as dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\\nChallenges persist as the incidence and prevalence of chronic \\nillness increase over recent decades. Chronic illness is now the \\nmost common reason for hospital admissions among children \\n(excluding trauma and newborn admissions). From middle \\nschool and beyond, mental illness is the main non–childbirth-\\nrelated reason for hospitalization among children. Pediatricians \\nmust also address the increasing concern about environmental \\ntoxins and the prevalence of physical, emotional, and sexual \\nabuse, and violence. World unrest and terrorism, such as the \\nSeptember 11 attack on New Y ork’s World Trade Center, have \\ncaused an increased level of anxiety and fear for many families \\nand children.\\nTo address these ongoing challenges, many pediatricians \\nnow practice as part of a health care team that includes \\npsychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers. This \\npatient-centered medical home model of care is designed to \\nprovide continuous and coordinated care to maximize health \\noutcomes. Other models, such as school-based health clinical \\nand retail medical facilities, may improve access but may not \\nsupport continuity and coordination of care.\\nChildhood antecedents of adult health conditions, such as \\nalcoholism, depression, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipid-\\nemias, are increasingly recognized. Infants who are relatively \\nunderweight at birth due to maternal malnutrition are at higher \\nrisk of developing certain health conditions later in life, including \\ndiabetes, heart disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and \\nobesity. Improved neonatal care results in greater survival of \\npreterm, low birthweight, or very low birthweight newborns, \\nincreasing the number of children with chronic medical condi-\\ntions and developmental delays with their lifelong implications.\\nLANDSCAPE OF HEALTH CARE FOR \\nCHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES\\nComplex health, economic, and psychosocial challenges greatly \\ninfluence the well-being and health outcomes of children. \\nNational reports from the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (CDC) (e.g., http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/\\nhus15.pdf) provide information about many of these issues. \\nSome of the key issues include the following:\\n•\\tHealth insurance coverage. Medicaid and the State Children’s \\nHealth Insurance Program provide coverage to health care \\naccess to more than 45 million children in 2013.The slow \\ndrop in uninsured children nationally over the past decade \\nleaves 5.5% of U.S. children lacking insurance in 2014. Despite \\npublic sector insurance, the rate of unvaccinated children \\nremains unchanged over the past 5 years.\\n•\\t Prenatal and perinatal care. Ten to 25% of women do not \\nreceive prenatal care during the first trimester. In addition, \\na significant percentage of women continue to smoke, use \\nillicit drugs, and consume alcohol during pregnancy.\\n•\\t Preterm births. The incidence of preterm births (<37 weeks) \\npeaked in 2006 and has been slowly declining (9.6% in 2014). \\nHowever, the rates of low birthweight infants (≤2,500 g [8%  \\nof all births]) and very low birthweight infants ( ≤1,500 g \\n[1.4% of all births]) are essentially unchanged since 2006.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The national birthrate among \\nadolescents has been steadily dropping since 1990, reaching \\nits lowest rate (24.2 per 1000) for 15- to 19-year-old ado -\\nlescents in 2014.\\n•\\t Adolescent abortions. In 2010 the percent of adolescent \\npregnancies that ended in abortion was 30%. The rate of \\nabortions among adolescents has been dropping since its \\npeak in 1988 and is now at its lowest rate since abortion \\nwas legalized in 1973.\\n•\\t Infant mortality. Internationally, infant mortality decreased \\nfrom 63 deaths per 1000 live births in 1990 to 32 deaths \\nper 1000 live births in 2015. In the United States, overall \\ninfant mortality rate decreased to a record low 5.96 per 1000 \\nlive births in 2013. A persistent disparity remains among \\nethnic groups. The infant mortality rate (in deaths per 1000 \\nlive births) is 4.96 for non-Hispanic white infant mortal-\\nity, 5.27 for Hispanic infants, and 11.61 black infants. U.S. \\ngeographic variability persists with highest mortality rates in  \\nthe South.\\n•\\t Initiation and maintenance of breast-feeding. Seventy-nine \\npercent of newborn infants start to breast-feed after birth. \\nBreast-feeding rates vary by ethnicity (higher rates in non-\\nHispanic whites and Hispanic mothers) and education \\n(highest in women with a bachelor’s degree or higher). Only \\n49% of women continue breast-feeding for 6 months, with \\nabout 27% continuing at 12 months.\\n•\\t Cause of death in U.S. children. The overall causes of death \\nin all children (1-24 years of age) in the United States in \\n2014, in order of frequency, were accidents (unintentional \\ninjuries), suicide, assaults (homicide), malignant neoplasms, \\nand congenital malformations (Table 1.1). There was a slight \\nimprovement in the rate of death from all causes.\\n•\\t Hospital admissions for children and adolescents. In 2014, \\n7.2% of children were admitted to a hospital at least once. \\nRespiratory illnesses are the predominant cause of hospitaliza-\\ntion for children 1-9 years of age, while mental illness is the \\nmost common cause of admission for adolescents.\\n•\\t Significant adolescent health challenges: substance use \\nand abuse. There is considerable substance use and abuse \\namong U.S. adolescents, although the overall trend in use \\nis declining. Current estimates are that between 36% and \\n50% of high school students currently drink alcohol. Overall \\nillicit drug use by adolescents is slowly declining (23.6% \\n12th graders reporting drug use in 2015). The teen smoking \\nrate is also declining (13% in 2002; 5.5% in 2015). However, \\nin 2014 more teens reported using electronic nicotine delivery \\nsystems (ENDS) than any other tobacco product. ENDS, \\ncommonly referred to as e-cigarettes, pose significant health \\nrisks to both users and nonusers.\\n•\\t Children in foster care. In 2013 just over 400,000 chil-\\ndren were in the foster care system. Children in foster \\ncare often have significant developmental, behavioral, and \\nemotional problems that require access to quality health and \\nmental health care services. Although adoptions account \\nfor nearly 20% of children exiting foster care annually, \\n25-50% of children leaving the welfare system experience \\nhomelessness and/or joblessness and will not graduate from  \\nhigh school.\\nOTHER HEALTH ISSUES THAT AFFECT \\nCHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES\\n•\\t Obesity. Obesity is the second leading cause of death in the \\nUnited States (estimated 300,000 deaths annually). Childhood \\nobesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled \\nin adolescents over the past 30 years. The prevalence of obese \\nchildren 6-19 years of age in 2012 was estimated at 39%.\\n•\\t Sedentary lifestyle. Currently, only 1 in 3 children are \\nphysically active every day. As technology continues to \\nadvance, children spend more time in front of a screen \\n(television, video games, computer, etc.), with some spending \\nmore than 7.5 hours per day.\\n•\\t Motor vehicle accidents and injuries. In 2014, 602 children \\n12 years of age or younger died in motor vehicle crashes, \\nand more than 121,350 were injured. Preliminary data suggest \\na slight increase in 2015. The impact of mobile device use \\nand increased speed limits is being considered. Carseat and \\nseatbelt use can reduce the risk of serious injury and death \\nby half for infants and children. On average, more than \\n12,000 children ages 0-19 years die each year of unintentional \\ninjury in the United States. Other causes of childhood injury \\nincluded drowning, suffocation, burns, child abuse, and \\npoisonings.\\n•\\t Child maltreatment. In 2014 there were an estimated 702,000 \\nreported cases of maltreatment with 1,580 deaths as a result \\nof abuse and neglect. The majority of children (75%) were \\nneglected; 17% suffered physical abuse, and nearly 8.3% \\nwere victims of sexual abuse.\\n•\\t Toxic stress in childhood leading to adult health challenges. \\nThe growing understanding of the interrelationship between \\nbiologic and developmental stresses, environmental exposure, \\nand the genetic potential of patients is helping us recognize \\nthe adverse impact of toxic stressors on health and well-being. \\nScreening for and acting upon factors that promote or hinder \\nearly development provides the best opportunity for long-\\nterm health. The field of epigenetics is demonstrating that \\nexposure to environmental stress impacts genetic expression \\nand can result in long-term effects on development, health, \\nand behaviors.\\nTABLE 1.1 Causes of Death by Age in the United States, \\n2014\\nAGE GROUP (YEAR)\\nCAUSES OF DEATH IN \\nORDER OF FREQUENCY\\n1-4 Unintentional injuries (accidents)\\nCongenital anomalies\\nHomicide\\nMalignant neoplasms\\nDiseases of the heart\\n5-14 Unintentional injuries (accidents)\\nMalignant neoplasms\\nSuicide\\nCongenital anomalies\\nHomicide\\nDiseases of the heart\\n15-24 Unintentional injuries (accidents)\\nSuicide\\nHomicide\\nMalignant neoplasms\\nDiseases of the heart\\nFrom National Center for Health Statistics (US).

Current armed conflicts \\nand political unrest have affected millions of adults and \\ntheir children. There are an estimated 1.3 million active \\nduty and National Guard/Reserve servicemen and service-\\nwomen, parents to more than a million children. An estimated \\n30% of troops returning from armed conflicts have a mental \\nhealth condition (alcoholism, depression, and post-traumatic \\nstress disorder) or report having experienced a traumatic \\nbrain injury. Their children are affected by these morbidities, \\nas well as by the psychologic impact of deployment. Child \\nmaltreatment is more prevalent in families of U.S.-enlisted \\nsoldiers during combat deployment than in nondeployed \\nsoldiers.\\nHEALTH DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE  \\nFOR CHILDREN\\nHealth disparities are the differences that remain after taking \\ninto account patients’ needs, preferences, and the availability \\nof health care. Social conditions, social inequity, discrimination, \\nsocial stress, language barriers, and poverty are antecedents to \\nand associated causes of health disparities. Disparities in infant \\nmortality relate to poor access to prenatal care and the lack of \\naccess and appropriate health services for women, such as \\npreventive services, family planning, and appropriate nutrition \\nand health care.\\n•\\t Infant\\tmortality\\tincreases\\tas\\tthe\\tmother’s\\tlevel\\tof\\teducation\\t\\ndecreases.\\n•\\t Children\\tfrom\\tpoor\\tfamilies\\tare\\tless\\tlikely\\tto\\tbe\\timmunized\\t\\nat 4 years of age and less likely to receive dental care.\\n•\\t Children\\t with\\t Medicaid/public \\t coverage\\t are \\tle ss \\tli kely \\t to\\t be \\t in\\t\\nexcellent health than children with private health insurance.\\n•\\t Rates\\to f \\th ospital \\tadmi ssion \\ta re \\thig her \\tf or \\tp eople \\tw ho \\tli ve \\t\\nin low-income areas.\\n•\\t Children\\tof\\tethnic\\tminorities\\tand\\tthose\\tfrom\\tpoor\\tfamilies\\t\\nare less likely to have physician office or hospital outpatient \\nvisits and more likely to have hospital emergency department \\nvisits.\\nCHANGING MORBIDITY: SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL \\nASPECTS OF PEDIATRIC PRACTICE\\n•\\t Changing morbidity reflects the relationship among \\nenvironmental, social, emotional, and developmental issues; \\nchild health status; and outcome. These observations are \\nbased on significant interactions of biopsychosocial influ-\\nences on health and illness, such as school problems, learning \\ndisabilities, and attention problems; child and adolescent \\nmood and anxiety disorders; adolescent suicide and homicide; \\nfirearms in the home; school violence; effects of media \\nviolence, obesity, and sexual activity; and substance use and \\nabuse by adolescents.\\n•\\t It\\ti s \\tes timated \\tt hat \\t1 \\tin \\t5 \\tc hildren, \\ta ges \\t13-18 \\ty ears, \\th as \\ta \\t\\nmental health condition. Fifty percent of all lifetime cases \\nof mental illness begin by age 14 years. The average delay \\nbetween onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years. \\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death for children \\nages 10-24 years, making early recognition of mental illness \\nparamount. Children from poor families are twice as likely \\nto have psychosocial problems as children from higher-\\nincome families. Nationwide, there is a lack of adequate \\nmental health services for children.\\nImportant influences on children’s health, in addition to \\npoverty, include homelessness, single-parent families, parental \\ndivorce, domestic violence, both parents working, and inadequate \\nchild care. Related pediatric challenges include improving the \\nquality of health care, social justice, equality in health care \\naccess, and improving the public health system. For adolescents, \\nthere are special concerns about sexuality, sexual orientation, \\npregnancy, substance use and abuse, violence, depression, and \\nsuicide.\\nCULTURE\\nThe growing diversity of the United States requires that health \\ncare workers make an attempt to understand the impact of \\nhealth, illness, and treatment on the patient and family from \\ntheir perspective. Facilitating a discussion of parental thoughts \\nand feelings about illness and its causes requires open-ended \\nquestions, such as: “What worries you the most about your \\nchild’s illness?” and “What do you think has caused your child’s \\nillness?” One must address concepts and beliefs about how \\npatients/families interact with health professionals, as well as \\ntheir spiritual and religious approach to health and health care \\nfrom a cultural perspective; this allows all to incorporate dif-\\nferences in perspectives, values, or beliefs into the care plan. \\nSignificant conflicts may arise because religious or cultural \\npractices may lead to the possibility of child abuse and neglect. \\nIn this circumstance, the suspected child abuse and neglect is \\nrequired, by law, to be reported to the appropriate social service \\nauthorities (see Chapter 22).\\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices \\nconstitute a part of the broad cultural perspective. Therapeutic \\nmodalities for CAM include biochemical, lifestyle, biomechani-\\ncal, and bioenergetic treatments, as well as homeopathy. It is \\nestimated that 20-40% of healthy children and more than 60% \\nof children with chronic illness use CAM. Only 30-60% of \\nthese children and families tell their physicians about their \\nuse of CAM. Screening for CAM use can aid the pediatrician’s \\ncounseling and minimize unintentional adverse interactions.\\nCHAPTER 2 \\nProfessionalism\\nCONCEPT OF PROFESSIONALISM\\nSociety provides a profession with economic, political, and \\nsocial rewards. Professions have specialized knowledge and \\nthe potential to maintain a monopoly on power and control, \\nremaining relatively autonomous. A profession exists as long \\nas it fulfills its responsibilities for the social good.\\nToday the activities of medical professionals are subject \\nto explicit public rules of accountability. Governmental and \\nother authorities at city, state, and federal levels grant limited \\nautonomy to professional organizations and their membership \\nthorough regulations, licensing requirement, and standards \\nof service (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and the Food and Drug \\nAdministration). The Department of Health and Human Services \\nregulates physician behavior in conducting research with the goal \\nof protecting human subjects. The National Practitioner Data \\nBank, created in 1986, contains information about physicians \\nand other health care practitioners who have been disciplined \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Hospitals are required to review information in \\nthis data bank every 2 years as part of clinician recredentialing. \\nThere are accrediting agencies for medical schools, such as \\nthe Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), and \\npostgraduate training, such as the Accreditation Council for \\nGraduate Medical Education (ACGME).\\nThe public trust of physicians is based on the physician’s \\ncommitment to altruism, which is a cornerstone of the Hip -\\npocratic Oath, an important rite of passage and part of medical \\nschool commencement ceremonies. The core of professionalism \\nis embedded in the daily healing work of the physician and \\nencompasses the patient-physician relationship. Professionalism \\nincludes an appreciation for the cultural and religious/spiritual \\nhealth beliefs of the patient, incorporating the ethical and moral \\nvalues of the profession and the moral values of the patient. \\nUnfortunately, the inappropriate actions of a few practicing \\nphysicians, physician investigators, and physicians in positions of \\npower have created a societal demand to punish those involved \\nand lead to the erosion of respect for the medical profession.\\nPROFESSIONALISM FOR PEDIATRICIANS\\nThe American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) adopted professional \\nstandards in 2000, and the American Academy of Pediatrics \\n(AAP) updated the policy statement and technical report on \\nProfessionalism in 2007, as follows:\\n•\\t Honesty/integrity is the consistent regard for the highest \\nstandards of behavior and the refusal to violate one’s personal \\nand professional codes. Maintaining integrity requires \\nawareness of situations that may result in conflict of interest \\nor that may result in personal gain at the expense of the \\nbest interest of the patient.\\n•\\t Reliability/responsibility includes accountability to one’s \\npatients, their families, to society, and the medical community \\nto ensure that all needs are addressed. There also must be \\na willingness to accept responsibility for errors.\\n•\\t Respect for others  requires the pediatrician to treat all \\npersons with respect and regard for their individual worth \\nand dignity; be aware of emotional, personal, family, and \\ncultural influences on a patient’s well-being, rights, and \\nchoices of medical care; and respect appropriate patient \\nconfidentiality.\\n•\\t Compassion/empathy requires the pediatrician to listen \\nattentively, respond humanely to the concerns of patients \\nand family members, and provide appropriate empathy for \\nand relief of pain, discomfort, and anxiety as part of daily \\npractice.\\n•\\t Self-improvement is the pursuit of and commitment to \\nproviding the highest quality of health care through lifelong \\nlearning and education.

Sometimes, ethical decision making in medical care \\nis a matter of choosing the least harmful option among many \\nadverse alternatives. In the day-to-day practice of medicine, \\nalthough all clinical encounters may have an ethical component, \\nmajor ethical challenges are infrequent.\\nThe legal system defines the minimal standards of behavior \\nrequired of physicians and the rest of society through the \\nlegislative, regulatory, and judicial systems. Laws support the \\nprinciple of confidentiality for teenagers who are competent \\nto decide about medical issues. Using the concept of limited \\nconfidentiality, parents, teenagers, and the pediatrician may \\nall agree to openly discuss serious health challenges, such as \\nsuicidal ideation and pregnancy. This reinforces the long-term \\ngoal of supporting the autonomy and identity of the teenager \\nwhile encouraging appropriate conversations with parents.\\nEthical problems derive from value differences  among \\npatients, families, and clinicians regarding choices and options \\nin the provision of health care. Resolving these value differ -\\nences involves several important ethical principles. Autonomy, \\nwhich is based on the principle of respect for persons, means \\nthat competent adult patients can make choices about health \\ncare that they perceive to be in their best interests after being \\nappropriately informed about their particular health condition \\nand the risks and benefits of alternative diagnostic tests and \\ntreatments. Paternalism challenges the principle of autonomy \\nand involves the clinician deciding what is best for the patient \\nbased on how much information is provided. Paternalism under \\ncertain circumstances (e.g., when a patient has a life-threatening \\nmedical condition or a significant psychiatric disorder and \\nis threatening self or others) may be more appropriate than \\nautonomy.\\nOther important ethical principles are those of beneficence \\n(doing good), nonmaleficence (doing no harm or as little harm \\nas possible), and justice (the values involved in the equality \\nof the distribution of goods, services, benefits, and burdens to \\nthe individual, family, or society).\\nETHICAL PRINCIPLES RELATED TO INFANTS, \\nCHILDREN, AND ADOLESCENTS\\nInfants and young children do not have the capacity for making \\nmedical decisions. Paternalism by parents and pediatricians in \\nthese circumstances is appropriate. Adolescents (<18 years of \\nage), if competent, have the legal right to make medical decisions \\nfor themselves. Children 8-9 years old can understand how \\nthe body works and the meaning of certain procedures; by age \\n14-15, young adolescents may be considered autonomous \\nthrough the process of being designated a mature or emancipated \\nminor or by having certain medical conditions.

A parent’s concern about the side effects of \\nimmunization raises a conflict between the need to protect \\nand support the health of the individual and of the public.\\nLEGAL ISSUES\\nAll competent patients of an age defined legally by each state \\n(usually ≥18 years of age) are considered autonomous regarding \\ntheir health decisions. To have the capacity to decide, patients \\nmust meet the following requirements:\\n•\\t Understand\\tt he \\tn ature \\to f \\tt he \\tm edical \\tin terventions \\ta nd \\t\\nprocedures, understand the risks and benefits of these \\ninterventions, and be able to communicate their decision.\\n•\\t Reason,\\tde liberate, \\ta nd \\tw eigh \\tt he \\tr isks \\ta nd \\tb enefits \\tu sing \\t\\ntheir understanding about the implications of the decision \\non their own welfare.\\n•\\t Apply\\ta\\tset\\tof\\tpersonal\\tvalues\\tto\\tthe\\tdecision-making\\tprocess\\t\\nand show an awareness of the possible conflicts or differences \\nin values as applied to the decisions to be made.\\nThese requirements must be placed within the context of \\nmedical care and applied to each case with its unique char -\\nacteristics. Most young children are not able to meet these \\nrequirements and need others, usually the parent, to serve as \\nthe legal surrogate decision maker. However, when child abuse \\nand neglect are present, a further legal process may determine \\nthe best interests of the child.\\nIt is important to become familiar with state law as it, not \\nfederal law, determines when an adolescent can consent to \\nmedical care and when parents may access confidential adoles-\\ncent medical information. The Health Insurance Portability and \\nAccountability Act (HIPAA), which became effective in 2003, \\nrequires a minimal standard of confidentiality protection. The \\nlaw confers less confidentiality protection to minors than to \\nadults. It is the pediatrician’s responsibility to inform minors of \\ntheir confidentiality rights and help them exercise these rights \\nunder the HIPAA regulations.\\nUnder special circumstances, nonautonomous adolescents \\nare granted the legal right to consent under state law when they \\nare considered mature or emancipated minors or because of \\ncertain public health considerations, as follows:\\n•\\tMature minors. Some states have legally recognized that \\nmany adolescents can meet the cognitive criteria and \\nemotional maturity for competence and may decide inde-\\npendently. The Supreme Court has decided that pregnant, \\nmature minors have the constitutional right to make decisions \\nabout abortion without parental consent. Although many \\nstate legislatures require parental notification, pregnant \\nadolescents wishing to have an abortion do not have to seek \\nparental consent. The state must provide a judicial procedure \\nto facilitate this decision making for adolescents.\\n•\\t Emancipated minors. Children who are legally emancipated \\nfrom parental control may seek medical treatment without \\nparental consent. The definition varies from state to state \\nbut generally includes children who have graduated from \\nhigh school, are members of the armed forces, married, \\npregnant, runaways, are parents, live apart from their parents, \\nand are financially independent or declared emancipated \\nby a court.\\n•\\t Interests of the state (public health). State legislatures have \\nconcluded that minors with certain medical conditions, such \\nas sexually transmitted infections and other contagious \\ndiseases, pregnancy (including prevention with the use of \\nbirth control), certain mental illnesses, and drug and alcohol \\nabuse, may seek treatment for these conditions autonomously. \\nStates have an interest in limiting the spread of disease that \\nmay endanger the public health and in eliminating barriers \\nto access for the treatment of certain conditions.\\nETHICAL ISSUES IN PRACTICE\\nClinicians should engage children and adolescents based on \\ntheir developmental capacity in discussions about medical plans \\nso that the child has a good understanding of the nature of \\nthe treatments and alternatives, the side effects, and expected \\noutcomes. There should be an assessment of the patient’s \\nunderstanding of the clinical situation, how the patient is \\nresponding, and the factors that may influence the patient’s \\ndecisions. Pediatricians should always listen to and appreci-\\nate patients’ requests for confidentiality and their hopes and \\nwishes. The ultimate goal is to help nourish children’s capacity to \\nbecome as autonomous as is appropriate to their developmental  \\nstage.\\nConfidentiality\\nConfidentiality is crucial to the provision of medical care and \\nis an important part of the basis for a trusting patient-family-\\nphysician relationship. Confidentiality means that information \\nabout a patient should not be shared without consent. If \\nconfidentiality is broken, patients may experience great harm \\nand may not seek needed medical care. See Chapter 67 for a \\ndiscussion of confidentiality in the care of adolescents.\\nEthical Issues in Genetic Testing and Screening \\nin Children\\nThe goal of screening is to identify diseases when there is no \\nclinically identifiable risk factor for disease. Screening should \\ntake place only when there is a treatment available or when a \\ndiagnosis would benefit the child. Testing usually is performed \\nwhen there is some clinically identifiable risk factor. Genetic \\ntesting and screening present special problems because test \\nresults have important implications. Some genetic screening \\n(sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis) may reveal a carrier \\nstate, which may lead to choices about reproduction or create \\nfinancial, psychosocial, and interpersonal problems (e.g., guilt, \\nshame, social stigma, and discrimination in insurance and \\njobs). Collaboration with, or referral to, a clinical geneticist \\nis appropriate in helping the family with the complex issues \\nof genetic counseling when a genetic disorder is detected or  \\nanticipated.\\nNewborn screening should not be used as a surrogate for \\nparental testing. Examples of diseases that can be diagnosed \\nby genetic screening, even though the manifestations of the \\ndisease process do not appear until later in life, are polycystic \\nkidney disease; Huntington disease; certain cancers, such as \\nbreast cancer in some ethnic populations; and hemochromatosis. \\nFor their own purposes, parents may pressure the pediatrician \\nto order genetic tests when the child is still young. Testing \\nfor these disorders should be delayed until the child has the \\ncapacity for informed consent or assent and is competent to \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

When an infant or child whose \\nparents have a religious prohibition against a blood transfusion \\nneeds a transfusion to save his or her life, the courts always \\nintervene to allow a transfusion. In contrast, parents with strong \\nreligious beliefs under some state laws may refuse immunizations \\nfor their children. States may use the principle of distributive \\njustice to require immunization of all during outbreaks or \\nepidemics, including individuals who object on religious \\ngrounds.\\nChildren as Human Subjects in Research\\nThe goal of research is to develop new and generalized knowl-\\nedge. Parents may give informed permission for children to \\nparticipate in research under certain conditions. Children cannot \\ngive consent but may assent or dissent to research protocols. \\nSpecial federal regulations have been developed to protect child \\nand adolescent participants in human investigation. These \\nregulations provide additional safeguards beyond those for adult \\nparticipants while still providing the opportunity for children \\nto benefit from the scientific advances of research.\\nMany parents with seriously ill children hope that the research \\nprotocol will have a direct benefit for their particular child. The \\ngreatest challenge for researchers is to be clear with parents \\nthat research is not treatment. This fact should be addressed \\nas sensitively and compassionately as possible.\\nCHAPTER 4 \\nPalliative Care and  \\nEnd-of-Life Issues\\nThe death of a child is one of life’s most difficult experiences. \\nThe palliative care approach is defined as patient- and family-\\ncentered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, \\npreventing, and treating suffering. This approach should be \\ninstituted when medical diagnosis, intervention, and treatment \\ncannot reasonably be expected to affect the imminence of death. \\nCentral to this approach is the willingness of clinicians to look \\nbeyond the traditional medical goals of curing disease and \\npreserving life and towards enhancing the life of the child with \\nassistance from family members and close friends. High-quality \\npalliative care is an expected standard at the end of life.\\nPalliative care in pediatrics is not simply end-of-life care. \\nChildren needing palliative care have been described as having \\nconditions that fall into four basic groups based on the goal of \\ntreatment. These include conditions of the following scenarios:\\n•\\t A\\tcure\\tis\\tpossible,\\tbut\\tfailure\\tis\\tnot\\tuncommon\\t(e.g.,\\tcancer\\t\\nwith a poor prognosis).\\n•\\t Long-term\\tt reatment\\ti s\\tp rovided\\tw ith\\ta\\tg oal\\to f\\tm aintaining\\t\\nquality of life (e.g., cystic fibrosis).\\n•\\t Treatment\\tt hat \\ti s \\tex clusively \\tp alliative \\ta fter \\tt he \\tdi agnosis \\t\\nof a progressive condition is made (e.g., trisomy 13 \\nsyndrome).\\n•\\t Treatments\\tare\\tavailable\\tfor\\tsevere,\\tnon-progressive\\tdisability\\t\\nin patients who are vulnerable to health complications (e.g., \\nsevere spastic quadriparesis with difficulty in controlling \\nsymptoms).\\nThese conditions present different timelines and different \\nmodels of medical intervention while sharing the need to \\nattend to concrete elements affecting the quality of a child’s \\ndeath and mediated by medical, psychosocial, cultural, and \\nspiritual concerns.\\nFamilies without time to prepare for the tragedy of an \\nunexpected death require considerable support. Palliative \\ncare can make important contributions to the end-of-life and \\nbereavement issues that families face in these circumstances. \\nThis may become complicated in circumstances where the cause \\nof the death must be fully explored. The need to investigate \\nthe possibility of child abuse or neglect subjects the family to \\nintense scrutiny and may create guilt and anger directed at \\nthe medical team.\\nPALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE\\nPalliative treatment is directed toward the relief of symptoms \\nas well as assistance with anticipated adaptations that may cause \\ndistress and diminish the quality of life of the dying child. \\nElements of palliative care include pain management; expertise \\nwith feeding and nutritional issues at the end of life; and \\nmanagement of symptoms, such as minimizing nausea and \\nvomiting, bowel obstruction, labored breathing, and fatigue. \\nPsychologic elements of palliative care have a profound impor-\\ntance and include sensitivity to bereavement, a developmental \\nperspective of a child’s understanding of death, clarification of \\nthe goals of care, and ethical issues. Palliative care is delivered \\nthrough a multidisciplinary approach, giving a broad range of \\nexpertise to patients and families as well as providing a sup-\\nportive network for the caregivers. Caregivers involved may \\nbe pediatricians, nurses, mental health professionals, social \\nworkers, and pastors.\\nA model of integrated palliative care rests on the following \\nprinciples:\\n•\\tRespect for the dignity of patients and families. The clini-\\ncian should respect and listen to patient and family goals, \\npreferences, and choices. School-age children can articulate \\npreferences about how they wish to be treated. Adolescents \\ncan engage in decision-making (see Section 12). Advanced \\ncare (advance directives) should be instituted with the child \\nand parents, allowing discussions about what they would \\nlike as treatment options as the end of life nears. Differences \\nof opinion between the family and the pediatrician should \\nbe addressed by identifying the multiple perspectives, \\nreflecting on possible conflicts, and altruistically coming to \\nagreements that validate the patient and family perspectives \\nyet reflect sound practice. Hospital ethics committees and \\nconsultation services are important resources for the pediatri-\\ncian and family members.\\n•\\t Access to comprehensive and compassionate palliative \\ncare. The clinician should address the physical symptoms, \\ncomfort, and functional capacity, with special attention to \\npain and other symptoms associated with the dying process, \\nand respond empathically to the psychologic distress and \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Respite should \\nbe available at any time during the illness to allow the family \\ncaregivers to rest and renew.\\n•\\t Use of interdisciplinary resources. Because of the complexity \\nof care, no one clinician can provide all of the needed services. \\nThe team members may include primary and subspecialty \\nphysicians, nurses in the hospital/facility or for home visits, \\nthe pain management team, psychologists, social workers, \\npastoral ministers, schoolteachers, friends of the family, and \\npeers of the child. The child and family should be in a position \\nto decide who should know what during all phases of the \\nillness process.\\n•\\t Acknowledgment and support provisions for caregivers. \\nThe primary caregivers of the child, family, and friends need \\nopportunities to address their own emotional concerns. Team \\nmeetings to address thoughts and feelings of team members \\nare crucial. Institutional support may include time to attend \\nfunerals, counseling for the staff, opportunities for families \\nto return to the hospital, and scheduled ceremonies to \\ncommemorate the death of the child.\\n•\\t Commitment to quality improvement of palliative care \\nthrough research and education. Hospitals should develop \\nsupport systems and staff to monitor the quality of care \\ncontinually, assess the need for appropriate resources, and \\nevaluate the responses of the patient and family members \\nto the treatment program.\\nHospice care is a treatment program for the end of life that \\nprovides the range of palliative care services by an interdisciplin-\\nary team including specialists in the bereavement and end-of-life \\nprocess. In 2010, legislation was passed allowing children covered \\nunder Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program \\n(CHIP) to receive access simultaneously to hospice care and \\ncurative care.\\nBEREAVEMENT\\nBereavement refers to the process of psychologic and spiritual \\naccommodation to death on the part of the child and the child’s \\nfamily. Grief has been defined as the emotional response caused \\nby a loss which may include pain, distress, and physical and \\nemotional suffering. It is a normal adaptive human response \\nto death. Assessing the coping resources and vulnerabilities of \\nthe affected family before death occurs is central to the palliative \\ncare approach.\\nParental grief is recognized as being more intense and \\nsustained than other types of grief. Most parents work through \\ntheir grief. Complicated grief, a pathologic manifestation of \\ncontinued and disabling grief, is rare. Parents who share their \\nproblems with others during the child’s illness, who have access \\nto psychologic support during the last month of their child’s \\nlife, and who have had closure sessions with the attending staff  \\nare more likely to resolve their grief. In the era of technology, \\nsome parents may find solace in connecting with other parents \\nwith similar experiences in an online forum.\\nA particularly difficult issue for parents is whether to talk with \\ntheir child about the child’s imminent death. Although evidence \\nsuggests that sharing accurate and truthful information with a \\ndying child is beneficial, each individual case presents its own \\ncomplexities, based on the child’s age, cognitive development, \\ndisease, timeline of disease, and parental psychologic state. \\nParents are more likely to regret not talking with their child \\nabout death than having done so.\\nCOGNITIVE ISSUES IN CHILDREN AND \\nADOLESCENTS: UNDERSTANDING DEATH \\nAND DYING\\nThe pediatrician should communicate with children about what \\nis happening to them while respecting the cultural and personal \\npreferences of the family. A developmental understanding of \\nchildren’s concepts of health and illness helps frame the discus-\\nsion and can help parents understand how their child is grappling \\nwith the situation. Piaget’s theories of cognitive development, \\nwhich help illustrate children’s concepts of death and disease, \\nare categorized as sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete \\noperations, and formal operations.\\nFor children up to 2 years of age (sensorimotor), death is \\nseen as a separation without a specific concept of death. The \\nassociated behaviors in grieving children of this age usually \\ninclude protesting and difficulty of attachment to other adults. \\nThe degree of difficulty depends on the availability of other \\nnurturing people with whom the child has a good previous \\nattachment.\\nChildren from 3-5 years of age (preoperational; sometimes \\ncalled the magic years) have trouble grasping the meaning of the \\nillness and the permanence of the death. Their language skills at \\nthis age make understanding their moods and behavior difficult. \\nBecause of a developing sense of guilt, death may be viewed \\nas punishment. If a child previously wished a younger sibling \\ndead, the death may be seen psychologically as being caused \\nby the child’s wishful thinking. They can feel overwhelmed \\nwhen confronted with the strong emotional reactions of their  \\nparents.\\nIn children ages 6-11 years of age (late preoperational to \\nconcrete operational), the finality of death gradually comes \\nto be understood. Magical thinking gives way to a need for \\ndetailed information to gain a sense of control. Older children \\nin this range have a strong need to control their emotions by \\ncompartmentalizing and intellectualizing.\\nIn adolescents (≥12 years of age) (formal operations), death \\nis a reality and is seen as universal and irreversible. Adolescents \\nhandle death issues at the abstract or philosophical level and \\ncan be realistic. They may also avoid emotional expression and \\ninformation, instead relying on anger or disdain. Adolescents \\ncan discuss withholding treatments. Their wishes, hopes, and \\nfears should be attended to and respected.\\nCULTURAL, RELIGIOUS, AND SPIRITUAL \\nCONCERNS ABOUT PALLIATIVE CARE AND \\nEND-OF-LIFE DECISIONS\\nUnderstanding the family’s religious/spiritual or cultural beliefs \\nand values about death and dying can help the pediatrician \\nwork with the family to integrate these beliefs, values, and \\npractices into the palliative care plan. Cultures vary regarding \\nthe roles family members have, the site of treatment for dying \\npeople, and the preparation of the body. Some ethnic groups \\nexpect the clinical team to speak with the oldest family member \\nor to only the head of the family outside of the patient’s presence, \\nwhile others involve the entire extended family in decision-\\nmaking. For some families, dying at home can bring the family \\nbad luck; others believe that the patient’s spirit will become \\nlost if the death occurs in the hospital. In some traditions, the \\nhealth care team cleans and prepares the body, whereas in \\nothers, family members prefer to complete this ritual. Religious/\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Families differ in the idea of organ donation and \\nthe acceptance of autopsy. Decisions, rituals, and withholding \\nof palliative or lifesaving procedures that could harm the child \\nor are not in the best interests of the child should be addressed. \\nQuality palliative care attends to this complexity and helps \\nparents and families through the death of a child while honoring \\nthe familial, cultural, and spiritual values.\\nETHICAL ISSUES IN END-OF-LIFE \\nDECISION-MAKING\\nBefore speaking with a child about death, the caregiver should \\nassess the child’s age, experience, and level of development; \\nthe child’s understanding and involvement in end-of-life \\ndecision-making; the parents’ emotional acceptance of death; \\ntheir coping strategies; and their philosophical, spiritual, and \\ncultural views of death. These may change over time. The \\nuse of open-ended questions to repeatedly assess these areas \\ncontributes to the end-of-life process. The care of a dying child \\ncan create ethical dilemmas involving autonomy, beneficence \\n(doing good), nonmaleficence (doing no harm), truth telling, \\nconfidentiality, or the physician’s duty. It is extremely difficult \\nfor parents to know when the burdens of continued medical \\ncare are no longer appropriate for their child and may, at \\ntimes, rely on the medical team for guidance. The beliefs and \\nvalues of what constitutes quality of life, when life ceases to be \\nworth living, and religious/spiritual, cultural, and philosophical \\nbeliefs may differ between families and health care workers. \\nThe most important ethical principle is what is in the best \\ninterest of the child as determined through the process of \\nshared decision-making , informed permission/consent  \\nfrom the parents, and assent from the child. Sensitive and \\nmeaningful communication with the family, in their own terms, \\nis essential. The physician, patient, and family must negotiate \\nthe goals of continued medical treatment while recognizing the \\nburdens and benefits of the medical intervention plan. There \\nis no ethical or legal difference between withholding treat -\\nment and withdrawing treatment, although many parents and \\nphysicians see the latter as more challenging. Family members \\nand the patient should agree about what are appropriate do \\nnot resuscitate  (also called DNR) orders. Foregoing some \\nmeasures does not preclude other measures being implemented \\nbased on the needs and wishes of the patient and family. \\nWhen there are serious differences among parents, children, \\nand physicians on these matters, the physician may consult \\nwith the hospital ethics committee  or, as a last resort, turn \\nto the legal system by filing a report about potential abuse  \\nor neglect.\\nORGAN DONATION IN PEDIATRICS\\nThe gap between supply and demand of transplantable organs \\nin children is widening as more patients need a transplant \\nwithout a concomitant increase in the organ donor pool. Organ \\ndonation can occur one of two ways: after fulfilling criteria \\nfor neurologic (brain) death or through a process of donation \\nafter circulatory death (DCD). DCD has only recently gained \\nacceptance in pediatrics. Organ procurement, donation, and \\ntransplantation are strictly regulated by governmental agen -\\ncies to ensure proper and fair allocation of donated organs for \\ntransplantation. It is important that pediatric medical specialists \\nand pediatricians be well acquainted with the strategies and \\nmethods of organ donation to help acquaint both the donor \\nfamily and the recipient family with the process and address \\nexpectations. Areas of concern within pediatric organ donation \\ninclude availability of and access to donor organs; oversight and \\ncontrol of the process; pediatric medical and surgical consulta-\\ntion and continued care throughout the transplantation process; \\nethical, social, financial, and follow-up; insurance-coverage; \\nand public awareness of the need for organ donors. Organ \\ndonation and organ transplantation can provide significant \\nlife-extending benefits to a child who has a failing organ \\nand is awaiting transplant, while at the same time place a \\nhigh emotional impact on the donor family after the loss of  \\na child.\\nSuggested Readings\\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Bioethics, Fallat ME, \\nGlover J.

Although a somatic history \\nand physical examination are important parts of each visit, \\nmany other issues are discussed, including nutrition, behavior, \\ndevelopment, safety, and anticipatory guidance.\\nDisorders of growth and development are often associated \\nwith chronic or severe illness or may be the only symptom \\nof parental neglect or abuse. Although normal growth and \\ndevelopment does not eliminate a serious or chronic illness, \\nin general, it supports a judgment that a child is healthy except \\nfor acute, often benign, illnesses that do not affect growth and \\ndevelopment.\\nThe processes of growth and development are intertwined. \\nHowever, it is convenient to refer to growth as the increase in \\nsize and development as an increase in function of processes \\nrelated to body and mind. Being familiar with normal patterns \\nof growth and development allows those practitioners who care \\nfor children to recognize and manage abnormal variations.\\nThe genetic makeup and the physical, emotional, and social \\nenvironment of the individual determine how a child grows \\nand develops throughout childhood. One goal of pediatrics \\nis to help each child achieve his or her individual potential \\nthrough periodically monitoring and screening for the normal \\nprogression or abnormalities of growth and development. The \\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine office \\nvisits in the first week of life (depending on timing of nursery \\ndischarge); at 2 weeks; at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months; at 2, \\n2 12, and 3 years; and then annually through adolescence/young \\nadulthood (see Fig. 9.1; the Bright Futures’ “Recommendations \\nfor Preventive Pediatric Health Care” found at https://www.aap.\\norg/en-us/documents/periodicity_schedule.pdf).\\nDeviations in growth patterns may be nonspecific or may be \\nimportant indicators of serious and chronic medical disorders. \\nAn accurate measurement of length/height, weight, and head \\ncircumference should be obtained at every health supervision \\nvisit and compared with statistical norms on growth charts. \\nTable 5.1 summarizes several convenient benchmarks to evaluate \\nnormal growth. Serial measurements are much more useful \\nthan single measurements to detect deviations from a particular \\ngrowth pattern even if the value remains within statistically \\ndefined normal limits (percentiles). Following the trend helps \\nSECTION 2 \\nGROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT\\nDavid A. Levine\\ndefine whether growth is within acceptable limits or warrants \\nfurther evaluation.\\nGrowth is assessed by plotting accurate measurements on \\ngrowth charts and comparing each set of measurements with \\nprevious measurements obtained at health visits. Please see \\nexamples in Figs. 5.1-5.4. Complete charts can be found at \\nwww.cdc.gov/growthcharts. The body mass index is defined as \\nbody weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; it \\nis used to classify adiposity and is recommended as a screening \\ntool for children and adolescents to identify those overweight \\nor at risk for being overweight (see Chapter 29).\\nNormal growth patterns have spurts and plateaus, so some \\nshifting on percentile graphs can be expected. Large shifts in \\npercentiles warrant attention, as do large discrepancies in height, \\nweight, and head circumference percentiles. When caloric intake \\nis inadequate, the weight percentile falls first, then the height, \\nand the head circumference is last. Caloric intake may be poor \\nas a result of inadequate feeding or because the child is not \\nreceiving adequate attention and stimulation (nonorganic failure \\nto thrive [see Chapter 21]).\\nCaloric intake also may be inadequate because of increased \\ncaloric needs. Children with chronic illnesses, such as heart \\nfailure or cystic fibrosis, may require a significantly higher caloric \\nintake to sustain growth.

Repeating \\na deviant measurement is the first step. Separate growth charts \\nare available and should be used for very low birthweight infants \\n(weight <1,500 g) a nd for those with Turner syndrome, Down \\nsyndrome, achondroplasia, and various other dysmorphology \\nsyndromes.\\nVariability in body proportions occurs from fetal to adult \\nlife. Newborns’ heads are significantly larger in proportion to \\nthe rest of their body. This difference gradually disappears. \\nCertain growth disturbances result in characteristic changes \\nin the proportional sizes of the trunk, extremities, and head. \\nPatterns requiring further assessment are summarized in  \\nTable 6.1.\\nEvaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history \\nand physical examination, helps determine whether the growth \\npattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful \\nwhen deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. \\nChildren, in general, follow their parents’ growth pattern, \\nalthough there are many exceptions.\\nFor a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows:\\nPaternal heighti nches Maternal heighti nches() () .+ −2 25\\nFor a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows:\\nPaternal heighti nches Maternal heighti nches() () .+ +2 25\\nActual growth depends on too many variables to make an \\naccurate prediction from midparental height determination \\nfor every child. The growth pattern of a child with low weight, \\nlength, and head circumference is commonly associated with \\nfamilial short stature (see Chapter 173). These children are \\ngenetically normal but are smaller than most children. A child \\nwho, by age, is preadolescent or adolescent and who starts \\npuberty later than others may have the normal variant called \\nconstitutional short stature (see Chapter 173); careful examina-\\ntion for abnormalities of pubertal development should be done. \\nAn evaluation for primary amenorrhea should be considered \\nfor any female adolescent who has not reached menarche by 15 \\nyears or has not done so within 3 years of thelarche (beginning \\nof breast development). Lack of breast development by age 13 \\nyears also should be evaluated (see Chapter 174).\\nStarting out in high growth percentiles, many children assume \\na lower percentile between 6 and 18 months of age until they \\nmatch their genetic programming; then they grow along new, \\nlower percentiles. They usually do not decrease more than two \\nmajor percentiles and have normal developmental, behavioral, \\nand physical examinations. These children with catch-down \\ngrowth should be followed closely, but no further evaluation \\nis warranted.\\nInfants born small for gestational age, or prematurely, ingest \\nmore breast milk or formula and, unless there are complications \\nthat require extra calories, usually exhibit catch-up growth in \\nthe first 6 months. These infants should be fed on demand \\nand provided as much as they want unless they are vomiting \\n(not just spitting up [see Chapter 128]). Some may benefit \\nfrom a higher caloric content formula. Many psychosocial \\nrisk factors that may have led to being born small or early \\nmay contribute to nonorganic failure to thrive (see Chapter \\n21). Conversely infants who recover from being low birth-\\nweight or premature have an increased risk of developing  \\nchildhood obesity.\\nGrowth of the nervous system is most rapid in the first \\n2 years, correlating with increasing physical, emotional, \\nbehavioral, and cognitive development. There is again rapid \\nchange during adolescence. Osseous maturation (bone age) \\nis determined from radiographs on the basis of the number \\nand size of calcified epiphyseal centers; the size, shape, density, \\nand sharpness of outline of the ends of bones; and the distance \\nseparating the epiphyseal center from the zone of provisional  \\ncalcification.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The American Academy of Pediatrics \\n4th edition sports preparticipation form is excellent for docu-\\nmenting cardiovascular and other risks. The patient and parent \\nshould complete the history form and be interviewed to assess \\ncardiovascular risk. Any history of heart disease or a murmur \\nmust be referred for evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. A \\nchild with a history of dyspnea or chest pain on exertion, \\nirregular heart rate (i.e., skipped beats, palpitations), or syncope \\nshould also be referred to a pediatric cardiologist. A family \\nhistory of a primary (immediate family) or secondary (immedi-\\nate family’s immediate family) atherosclerotic disease (myocardial \\ninfarction or cerebrovascular disease) before 50 years of age \\nor sudden unexplained death at any age also requires additional \\nassessment.\\nChildren interested in contact sports should be assessed for \\nspecial vulnerabilities. Similarly, vision should be assessed as \\na crucial part of the evaluation before participation in sports.\\nADOLESCENCE\\nAdolescents need annual comprehensive health assessments \\nto ensure progression through puberty without major problems \\n(see Chapters 67 and 68). Sexual maturity is an important issue \\nin adolescents, and all adolescents should be assessed to monitor \\nprogression through sexual maturity rating stages (see Chapter \\n67). Other issues in physical development include scoliosis, \\nobesity, and common orthopedic growth issues (e.g., Osgood \\nSchlatter; see Chapters 29 and 203). Most scoliosis is mild and \\nrequires only observation for resolution. Obesity may first \\nmanifest during childhood and is a growing public health for \\nmany adolescents.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES\\nThe use of milestones to assess development focuses on discrete \\nbehaviors that the clinician can observe or accept as present \\nby parental report. This approach is based on comparing the \\npatient’s behavior with that of many normal children whose \\nbehaviors evolve in a uniform sequence within specific age \\nranges (see Chapter 8). The development of the neuromuscular \\nsystem, similar to that of other organ systems, is determined \\nfirst by genetic endowment and then is molded by environmental \\ninfluences.\\nAlthough a sequence of specific, easily measured behaviors \\ncan adequately represent some areas of development ( gross \\nmotor, fine motor , and language), other areas, particularly \\nsocial and emotional development, are not as easy to assess. \\nEasily measured developmental milestones are well established \\nthrough age 6 years only. Other types of assessment (e.g., intel-\\nligence tests, school performance, and personality profiles) that \\nexpand the developmental milestone approach are available \\nfor older children.\\nCHAPTER 7 \\nNormal Development\\nPHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT\\nParallel to the changes in the developing brain (i.e., cognition, \\nlanguage, behavior) are changes in the physical development \\nof the body.\\nNEWBORN PERIOD\\nObservation of any asymmetric movement or altered muscle \\ntone and function may indicate a significant central nervous \\nsystem abnormality or a nerve palsy resulting from the delivery \\nand requires further evaluation. Primitive neonatal reflexes are \\nunique in the newborn period and can further elucidate or \\neliminate concerns over asymmetric function. The most \\nimportant reflexes to assess during the newborn period are as \\nfollows:\\nThe Moro reflex is elicited by allowing the infant’s head to \\ngently move back suddenly (from a few inches off of the \\nmattress onto the examiner’s hand), resulting in a startle, \\nthen abduction and upward movement of the arms fol-\\nlowed by adduction and flexion. The legs respond with  \\nflexion.\\nThe rooting reflex is elicited by touching the corner of the \\ninfant’s mouth, resulting in lowering of the lower lip on  \\nthe same side with tongue movement toward the stimulus. \\nThe face also turns toward the stimulus.\\nThe sucking reflex occurs with almost any object placed in \\nthe newborn’s mouth. The infant responds with vigorous \\nsucking. The sucking reflex is replaced later by voluntary \\nsucking.\\nThe asymmetric tonic neck reflex  is elicited by placing the \\ninfant supine and turning the head to the side. This place -\\nment results in ipsilateral extension of the arm and the \\nleg into a “fencing” position. The contralateral side flexes  \\nas well.\\nA delay in the expected disappearance of the reflexes may \\nalso warrant an evaluation of the central nervous system.\\nSee Sections 11 and 26 for additional information on the \\nnewborn period.\\nLATER INFANCY\\nWith the development of gross motor skills, the infant is first \\nable to control his or her posture, then proximal musculature, \\nand, last, distal musculature. As the infant progresses through \\nthese stages, the parents may notice orthopedic deformities (see \\nChapters 202 and 203). The infant also may have deformities \\nthat are related to intrauterine positioning. Physical examina-\\ntion should indicate whether the deformity is fixed or can \\nbe moved passively into the proper position. When a joint \\nheld in an abnormal fashion can be moved passively into the \\nproper position, there is a high likelihood of resolving with \\nthe progression of gross motor development. Fixed deformi-\\nties warrant immediate pediatric orthopedic consultation (see  \\nSection 26).\\nEvaluation of vision and ocular movements is important \\nto prevent the serious outcome of strabismus.

Holding \\na child back for reasons of developmental delay, in the false \\nhope that the child will catch up, can also lead to difficulties. \\nThe child should enroll on schedule, and educational planning \\nshould be initiated to address any deficiencies.\\nPhysicians should be able to identify children at risk for \\nschool difficulties, such as those who have developmental delays \\nor physical disabilities. These children may require specialized \\nschool services in an individualized education plan (IEP).\\nAdolescence\\nSome define adolescence as 10-25 years of age, but adolescence \\nis perhaps better characterized by the developmental stages \\n(early, middle, and late adolescence) that all teens must negotiate \\nto develop into healthy, functional adults. Different behavioral \\nand developmental issues characterize each stage. The age at \\nwhich each issue manifests and the importance of these issues \\nvary widely among individuals, as do the rates of cognitive, \\npsychosexual, psychosocial, and physical development.\\nDuring early adolescence, attention is focused on the \\npresent and on the peer group. Concerns are primarily related \\nto the body’s physical changes and normality. Strivings for \\nindependence are ambivalent. These young adolescents are \\ndifficult to interview because they often respond with short, \\nclipped conversation and may have little insight. They are just \\nbecoming accustomed to abstract thinking.\\nMiddle adolescence can be a difficult time for adolescents \\nand the adults who have contact with them. Cognitive processes \\nare more sophisticated. Through abstract thinking, middle \\nadolescents can experiment with ideas, consider things as they \\nmight be, develop insight, and reflect on their own feelings and \\nPSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT\\nBonding and Attachment in Infancy\\nThe terms bonding and attachment describe the affective relation-\\nships between parents and infants. Bonding occurs shortly \\nafter birth and reflects the feelings of the parents toward the \\nnewborn (unidirectional). Attachment involves reciprocal \\nfeelings between parent and infant and develops gradually over \\nthe first year.\\nAttachment of infants outside of the newborn period is crucial \\nfor optimal development. Infants who receive extra attention, \\nsuch as parents responding immediately to any crying or fussi-\\nness in the first 4 months, show less crying and fussiness at \\nthe end of the first year. Stranger anxiety develops between 9 \\nand 18 months of age, when infants normally become insecure \\nabout separation from the primary caregiver. The infant’s new \\nmotor skills and attraction to novelty may lead to headlong \\nplunges into new adventures that result in fright or pain followed \\nby frantic efforts to find and cling to the primary caregiver. \\nThe result is dramatic swings from stubborn independence to \\nclinging dependence that can be frustrating and confusing to \\nparents. With secure attachment, this period of ambivalence \\nmay be shorter and less tumultuous.\\nDeveloping Autonomy in Early Childhood\\nToddlers build on attachment and begin developing autonomy \\nthat allows separation from parents. In times of stress, toddlers \\noften cling to their parents, but in their usual activities they \\nmay be actively separated. Ages 2-3 years are a time of major \\naccomplishments in fine motor skills, social skills, cognitive \\nskills, and language skills. The dependency of infancy yields \\nto developing independence and the “I can do it myself ” age. \\nLimit setting is essential to a balance of the child’s emerging \\nindependence.\\nEarly Childhood Education\\nThere is a growing body of evidence that notes that children \\nwho are in high quality early learning environments are more \\nprepared to succeed in school. Every dollar invested in early \\nchildhood education may save taxpayers up to 13 dollars in \\nfuture costs. These children commit fewer crimes and are better \\nprepared to enter the workforce after school. Early Head Start \\n(less than 3 years), Head Start (3-4 years), and prekindergarten \\nprograms (4-5 years) all demonstrate better educational attain-\\nment, although the earlier the start, the better the results.\\nSchool Readiness\\nReadiness for preschool depends on the development of \\nautonomy and the ability of the parent and the child to separate \\nfor hours at a time. Preschool experiences help children develop \\nsocialization skills; improve language; increase skill building \\nin areas such as colors, numbers, and letters; and increase \\nproblem solving (puzzles).\\nReadiness for school (kindergarten) requires emotional matu-\\nrity, peer group and individual social skills, cognitive abilities, \\nand fine and gross motor skills (Table 7.1). Other issues include \\nchronological age and gender. Children tend to do better in \\nkindergarten if their fifth birthday is at least 4-6 months before \\nthe beginning of school. Girls usually are ready earlier than boys. \\nTABLE 7.1 Evaluating School Readiness\\nPHYSICIAN OBSERVATIONS (BEHAVIORS OBSERVED  \\nIN THE OFFICE)\\nEase of separation of the child from the parent\\nSpeech development and articulation\\nUnderstanding of and ability to follow complex directions\\nSpecific pre-academic skills\\n Knowledge of colors\\n Counts to 10\\n Knows age, first and last names, address, and phone number\\n Ability to copy shapes\\nMotor skills\\n Stand on one foot, skip, and catch a bounced ball\\n Dresses and undresses without assistance\\nPARENT OBSERVATIONS (QUESTIONS ANSWERED  \\nBY HISTORY)\\nDoes the child play well with other children?\\nDoes the child separate well, such as a child playing in the \\nbackyard alone with occasional monitoring by the parent?\\nDoes the child show interest in books, letters, and numbers?\\nCan the child sustain attention to quiet activities?\\nHow frequent are toilet-training accidents?\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Three common constellations \\nof temperamental characteristics are as follows:\\n1. The easy child (about 40% of children) is characterized by \\nregularity of biological functions (consistent, predictable \\ntimes for eating, sleeping, and elimination), a positive \\napproach to new stimuli, high adaptability to change, mild \\nor moderate intensity in responses, and a positive mood.\\n2. The difficult child (about 10%) is characterized by irregularity \\nof biological functions, negative withdrawal from new stimuli, \\npoor adaptability, intense responses, and a negative mood.\\n3. The slow to warm up child (about 15%) is characterized \\nby a low activity level, withdrawal from new stimuli, slow \\nadaptability, mild intensity in responses, and a somewhat \\nnegative mood.\\nThe remaining 35% of children have more mixed tempera-\\nments. The individual temperament of a child has important \\nimplications for parenting and for the advice a pediatrician may \\ngive in anticipatory guidance or behavioral problem counseling.\\nAlthough temperament may be hardwired (nature) in each \\nchild to some degree, the environment (nurture) in which \\nthe child grows has a strong effect on the child’s adjustment. \\nSocial and cultural factors can have marked effects on the child \\nthrough differences in parenting style, educational approaches, \\nand behavioral expectations.\\nCHAPTER 8 \\nDisorders of Development\\nDEVELOPMENTAL SURVEILLANCE  \\nAND SCREENING\\nDevelopmental and behavioral problems are more common \\nthan any category of problems in pediatrics, except acute \\ninfections and trauma. In 2008, 15% of children ages 3-7 had \\na developmental disability and others had behavioral disabilities. \\nAs many as 25% of children have serious psychosocial problems. \\nParents often neglect to mention these problems because they \\nthink the physician is uninterested or cannot help. It is necessary \\nto monitor development and screen for the presence of these \\nproblems at health supervision visits, particularly in the years \\nbefore preschool or early childhood learning center enrollment.\\nDevelopment surveillance, done at every office visit, is an \\ninformal process comparing skill levels to lists of milestones. If \\nsuspicion of developmental or behavioral issues recurs, further \\nevaluation is warranted (Table 8.1). Surveillance does not have \\na standard, and screening tests are necessary.\\nDevelopmental screening involves the use of standard -\\nized screening tests to identify children who require further \\ndiagnostic assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics \\nrecommends the use of validated standardized screening tools \\nat three of the health maintenance visits: 9 months, 18 months, \\nand 30 months. Clinics and offices that serve a higher risk patient \\npopulation (children living in poverty) often perform a screening \\ntest at every health maintenance visit. A child who fails to pass \\na developmental screening test requires more comprehensive \\nevaluation but does not necessarily have a delay; definitive \\ntesting must confirm. Developmental evaluations for children \\nwith suspected delays and intervention services for children with \\ndiagnosed disabilities are available free to families. A combina-\\ntion of U.S. state and federal funds provides these services.\\nthe feelings of others. As they mature, these adolescents focus \\non issues of identity not limited solely to the physical aspects \\nof their body. They explore their parents’ and culture’s values, \\nsometimes by expressing the contrary side of the dominant \\nvalue. Many middle adolescents explore these values in their \\nminds only; others do so by challenging their parents’ authority. \\nMany engage in high-risk behaviors, including unprotected \\nsexual intercourse, substance abuse, or dangerous driving. The \\nstrivings of middle adolescents for independence, limit testing, \\nand need for autonomy often distress their families, teachers, or \\nother authority figures. These adolescents are at higher risk for \\nmorbidity and mortality from accidents, homicide, or suicide.\\nLate adolescence usually is marked by formal operational \\nthinking, including thoughts about the future (e.g., educational, \\nvocational, and sexual). Late adolescents are usually more com-\\nmitted to their sexual partners than are middle adolescents. \\nUnresolved separation anxiety from previous developmental \\nstages may emerge, at this time, as the young person begins \\nto move physically away from the family of origin to college \\nor vocational school, a job, or military service.\\nMODIFYING PSYCHOSOCIAL BEHAVIORS\\nChild behavior is determined by heredity and by the environ-\\nment. Behavioral theory postulates that behavior is primarily \\na product of external environmental determinants and that \\nmanipulation of the environmental antecedents and conse-\\nquences of behavior can be used to modify maladaptive behavior \\nand to increase desirable behavior (operant conditioning). The \\nfour major methods of operant conditioning are positive \\nreinforcement, negative reinforcement, extinction, and punish-\\nment. Many common behavioral problems of children can be \\nameliorated by these methods.\\nPositive reinforcement increases the frequency of a behavior \\nby following the behavior with a favorable event (e.g., praising a \\nchild for excellent school performance). Negative reinforcement \\nusually decreases the frequency of a behavior by removal, cessa-\\ntion, or avoidance of an unpleasant event. Conversely, sometimes \\nthis reinforcement may occur unintentionally, increasing the \\nfrequency of an undesirable behavior. For example, a toddler may \\npurposely try to stick a pencil in a light socket to obtain atten-\\ntion, whether it be positive or negative. Extinction occurs when \\nthere is a decrease in the frequency of a previously reinforced \\nbehavior because the reinforcement is withheld. Extinction is \\nthe principle behind the common advice to ignore behavior \\nsuch as crying at bedtime or temper tantrums, which parents \\nmay unwittingly reinforce through attention and comforting. \\nPunishment decreases the frequency of a behavior through \\nunpleasant consequences.\\nPositive reinforcement is more effective than punishment. \\nPunishment is more effective when combined with positive \\nreinforcement.

Although 30% of children \\nscreened may be over-referred for definitive developmental \\ntesting, this group also includes children whose skills are below \\naverage and who may benefit from testing that may help address \\nrelative developmental deficits.

Unless the dysfluency is severe, is accompanied by tics \\nor unusual posturing, or occurs after 4 years of age, parents \\nshould be counseled that it is normal and transient and to \\naccept it calmly and patiently.\\nAfter the child’s sixth birthday and until adolescence, devel-\\nopmental assessment is initially done by inquiring about school \\nperformance (academic achievement and behavior). Inquiring \\nabout concerns raised by teachers or other adults who care \\nfor the child (after-school program counselor, coach, religious \\nleader) is prudent. Formal developmental testing of these older \\nchildren is beyond the scope of the primary care pediatrician. \\nNonetheless, the health care provider should be the coordinator \\nof the testing and evaluation performed by other specialists \\n(e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, developmental pediatricians, \\nand educational professionals).\\nOTHER ISSUES IN ASSESSING DEVELOPMENT \\nAND BEHAVIOR\\nIgnorance of environmental influences on child behavior may \\nresult in ineffective or inappropriate management (or both). \\nTable 8.4 lists some contextual factors that should be consid-\\nered in the etiology of a child’s behavioral or developmental  \\nproblem.\\nBuilding rapport with the parents and the child is a pre -\\nrequisite for obtaining the often sensitive information that is \\nessential for understanding a behavioral or developmental issue. \\nRapport usually can be established quickly if the parents sense \\nthat the clinician respects them and is genuinely interested \\nin listening to their concerns. The clinician develops rapport \\nwith the child by engaging the child in developmentally \\nappropriate conversation or play, perhaps providing toys \\nwhile interviewing the parents, and being sensitive to the fears \\nthe child may have. Too often, the child is ignored until it is \\ntwo predictive or three total behaviors, further assessment with \\nan interview algorithm is indicated to distinguish normal variant \\nbehaviors from those children needing a referral for definitive \\ntesting. The test is freely distributed on the internet and is \\navailable at https://www.m-chat.org (see Chapter 20).\\nLanguage screening correlates best with cognitive develop-\\nment in the early years. Table 8.2 provides some rules of thumb \\nfor language development that focus on speech production \\n(expressive language). Although expressive language is the \\nmost obvious language element, the most dramatic changes \\nin language development in the first years involve recognition \\nand understanding (receptive language).\\nWhenever there is a speech and/or language delay, a hearing \\ndeficit must be considered.

The American Academy of \\nPediatrics’ (AAP) Bright Futures information standardizes each \\nof the health maintenance visits and provides resources for \\nworking with the children and families of different ages (see \\nhttps://brightfutures.aap.org). Elements of each visit include \\nevaluation and management of parental concerns; inquiry about \\nany interval illness since the last physical, growth, development, \\nand nutrition; anticipatory guidance (including safety informa-\\ntion and counseling); physical examination; screening tests; \\nand immunizations (Table 9.1). The Bright Futures Recom-\\nmendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care, found at \\nhttps://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/periodicity_schedule.pdf, \\nsummarizes requirements and indicates the ages that specific \\nprevention measures should be undertaken, including risk \\nscreening and performance items for specific measurements. \\nBright Futures is now the enforced standard for the Medicaid \\nand the Children’s Health Insurance Program, along with many \\ninsurers. Health maintenance and immunizations now are \\ncovered without copays for insured patients as part of the Patient \\nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\\ntime for the physical examination. Similar to their parents, \\nchildren feel more comfortable if they are greeted by name \\nand involved in pleasant interactions before they are asked \\nsensitive questions or threatened with examinations. Y oung \\nchildren can be engaged in conversation on the parent’s lap, \\nwhich provides security and places the child at the eye level of the  \\nexaminer.\\nWith adolescents, emphasis should be placed on building a \\nphysician-patient relationship that is distinct from the relation-\\nship with the parents. The parents should not be excluded; \\nhowever, the adolescent should have the opportunity to express \\nconcerns to and ask questions of the physician in confidence. \\nTwo intertwined issues must be taken into consideration―\\nconsent and confidentiality. Although laws vary from state to \\nstate, in general, adolescents who are able to give informed \\nconsent (i.e., mature minors) may consent to visits and care \\nrelated to high-risk behaviors (i.e., substance abuse; sexual \\nhealth, including prevention, detection, and treatment of \\nsexually transmitted infections; and pregnancy). Most states \\nsupport the physician who wishes the visit to be confidential. \\nPhysicians should become familiar with the governing law in \\nthe state where they practice (see https://www.guttmacher.org). \\nProviding confidentiality is crucial, allowing for optimal care \\n(especially for obtaining a history of risk behaviors). When \\nassessing development and behavior, confidentiality can be \\nachieved by meeting with the adolescent alone for at least \\npart of each visit. However, parents must be informed when \\nthe clinician has significant and immediate concerns about \\nthe health and safety of the child. Often, the clinician can \\nconvince the adolescent to inform the parents directly about \\na problem or can reach an agreement with the adolescent \\nabout how the parents will be informed by the physician (see  \\nChapter 67).\\nEVALUATING DEVELOPMENTAL AND \\nBEHAVIORAL ISSUES\\nResponses to open-ended questions often provide clues to \\nunderlying, unstated problems and identify the appropriate \\ndirection for further, more directed questions. Histories about \\ndevelopmental and behavioral problems are often vague and \\nconfusing; to reconcile apparent contradictions, the interviewer \\nfrequently must request clarification, more detail, or mere \\nrepetition. By summarizing an understanding of the information \\nat frequent intervals and by recapitulating at the close of the \\nvisit, the interviewer and patient and family can ensure that \\nthey understand each other.\\nIf the clinician’s impression of the child differs markedly from \\nthe parent’s description, there may be a crucial parental concern \\nor issue that has not yet been expressed, either because it may \\nbe difficult to talk about (e.g., marital problems), because it is \\nunconscious, or because the parent overlooks its relevance to \\nthe child’s behavior. Alternatively, the physician’s observations \\nmay be atypical, even with multiple visits. The observations of \\nteachers, relatives, and other regular caregivers may be crucial in \\nsorting out this possibility. The parent also may have a distorted \\nimage of the child, rooted in parental psychopathology. A sensi-\\ntive, supportive, and noncritical approach to the parent is crucial \\nto appropriate intervention.

Standard sounds are played, and the transmission of \\nthe impulse to the brain is documented. If abnormal, a further \\nevaluation using evoked response technology of sound transmis-\\nsion is indicated.\\nHearing and Vision Screening of  \\nOlder Children\\nInfants and Toddlers\\nInferences about hearing are drawn from asking parents about \\nresponses to sound and speech and by examining speech and \\nlanguage development closely. Inferences about vision may be \\nmade by examining gross motor milestones (children with \\nvision problems may have a delay) and by physical examination \\nof the eye. Parental concerns about vision should be sought \\nuntil the child is 3 years of age and about hearing until the \\nchild is 4 years of age. If there are concerns, definitive testing \\nshould be arranged. Hearing can be screened by auditory evoked \\nresponses, as mentioned for newborns. For toddlers and older \\nchildren who cannot cooperate with formal audiologic testing \\nwith headphones, behavioral audiology may be used. Sounds \\nof a specific frequency or intensity are provided in a standard \\nenvironment within a soundproof room, and responses are \\nassessed by a trained audiologist. Vision may be assessed by \\nreferral to a pediatric ophthalmologist and by visual evoked \\nresponses.\\nChildren 3 Years of Age and Older\\nAt various ages, hearing and vision should be screened objec-\\ntively using standard techniques as specified in the Bright Futures \\nRecommendations. Asking the family and child about any \\nconcerns or consequences of poor hearing or vision accomplishes \\nsubjective evaluation. At 3 years of age, children are screened \\nfor vision for the first time if they are developmentally able to \\nbe tested. Many children at this age do not have the interactive \\nlanguage or interpersonal skills to perform a vision screen; \\nthese children should be re-examined at a 3-6-month interval \\nto ensure that their vision is normal. Because most of these \\nchildren do not yet identify letters, using a Snellen eye chart \\nwith standard shapes is recommended. When a child is able \\nto identify letters, the more accurate letter-based chart should \\nbe used. Audiologic testing of sounds with headphones should \\nbe begun on the fourth birthday (although Head Start requires \\nthat pediatricians attempt the hearing screening at 3 years of \\nage). Any suspected audiologic problem should be evaluated \\nby a careful history and physical examination with referral for \\ncomprehensive testing. Children who have a documented vision \\nproblem, failed screening, or parental concern should be referred, \\npreferably to a pediatric ophthalmologist.\\nAnemia Screening\\nChildren are screened for anemia at ages when there is a higher \\nincidence of iron deficiency anemia. Infants are screened at \\nbirth and again at 4 months if there is a documented risk, such \\nas low birthweight or prematurity. All infants are screened at \\n12 months of age because this is when a high incidence of iron \\ndeficiency is noted. Children are assessed at other visits for \\nrisks or concerns related to anemia (denoted by a star in the \\nBright Futures Recommendations at http://brightfutures.aap.org/\\nclinical_practice.html). Any abnormalities detected should be \\nSCREENING TESTS\\nChildren usually are quite healthy and only the following \\nscreening tests are recommended: newborn metabolic screening \\nwith hemoglobin electrophoresis, hearing and vision evaluation, \\nanemia and lead screening, and tuberculosis testing. Children \\nborn to families with dyslipidemias or early heart disease should \\nalso be screened for lipid disorders; in addition, all children \\nshould have a routine cholesterol test between ages 9 and 11. \\n(Items marked by a star in the Bright Futures Recommendations \\nshould be performed if a risk factor is found.) Sexually expe -\\nrienced adolescents should be screened for sexually transmissible \\ninfections and have an HIV test at least once between 16 and \\n18. When an infant, child, or adolescent begins with a new \\nphysician, the pediatrician should perform any missing screening \\ntests and immunizations.\\nNewborn Screening\\nMetabolic Screening\\nEvery state in the United States mandates newborn metabolic \\nscreening. Each state determines its own priorities and proce-\\ndures, but the following diseases are usually included in meta-\\nbolic screening: phenylketonuria, galactosemia, congenital \\nhypothyroidism, maple sugar urine disease, and organic aciduria \\n(see Section 10). Many states now screen for cystic fibrosis \\n(CF) by testing for immunoreactive trypsinogen. If that test is \\npositive, then a DNA analysis for the most common cystic \\nfibrosis mutations is performed. This is not a perfect test due \\nto the myriad mutations that lead to CF . Clinical suspicion \\nwarrants evaluation even if there were no CF mutations noted \\non the DNA analysis.\\nHemoglobin Electrophoresis\\nChildren with hemoglobinopathies are at higher risk for infection \\nand complications from anemia, which early detection may \\nprevent or ameliorate. Infants with sickle cell disease are begun \\non oral penicillin prophylaxis to prevent sepsis, which is the \\nmajor cause of mortality in these infants (see Chapter 150).\\nCritical Congenital Heart Disease Screening\\nNew for the fourth edition of Bright Futures is newborn screen-\\ning for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Newborns \\nwith cyanotic congenital heart disease may be missed if the \\nductus arteriosus is still open; when the ductus closes, these \\nchildren become profoundly cyanotic, leading to complications \\nand even death. The AAP now mandates screening with pulse \\noximetry of the right hand and foot. The baby passes screening \\nif the oxygen saturation is 95% or greater in the right hand \\nand foot and the difference is three percentage points or less \\nbetween the right hand and foot. The screen is immediately \\nfailed if the oxygen saturation is less than 90% in the right \\nhand and foot. Equivocal tests are repeated, or echocardiography \\nand pediatric cardiology consultation are warranted (see \\nChapters 143 and 144).\\nHearing Evaluation\\nBecause speech and language are central to a child’s cognitive \\ndevelopment, the hearing screening is performed before dis-\\ncharge from the newborn nursery.

In general, the standardized purified protein derivative \\nintradermal test is used with evaluation by a health care provider \\n48-72 hours after injection. The size of induration, not the \\ncolor of any mark, denotes a positive test. For most patients, \\n10 mm o f induration is a positive test. For HIV-positive patients, \\nthose with recent tuberculosis contacts, patients with evidence \\nof old healed tuberculosis on chest film, or immunosuppressed \\npatients, 5 mm i s a positive test (see Chapter 124). The CDC \\nhas also approved the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, which has \\nthe advantage of needing one office visit only.\\nCholesterol\\nChildren and adolescents who have a family history of cardio-\\nvascular disease or have at least one parent with a high blood \\ncholesterol level are at increased risk of having high blood \\ncholesterol levels as adults and increased risk of coronary heart \\ndisease. The AAP recommends dyslipidemia screening in the \\ncontext of regular health care for at-risk populations (Table \\n9.4) by obtaining a fasting lipid profile. The recommended \\nscreening levels are the same for all children 2-18 years. Total \\ncholesterol of less than 170 m g/dL is normal, 170-199  m g/dL \\nis borderline, and greater than 200 m g/dL is elevated. In addition, \\nin 2011, the AAP endorsed the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \\nInstitute of the National Institutes of Health recommendation \\nto test all children between ages 9 and 11.\\nSexually Transmitted Infection Testing\\nAnnual office visits are recommended for adolescents. A \\nfull adolescent psychosocial history should be obtained in \\nevaluated for etiology. Anemic infants do not perform as well \\non standard developmental testing. When iron deficiency is \\nstrongly suspected, a therapeutic trial of iron may be used (see \\nChapter 150).\\nLead Screening\\nLead intoxication may cause developmental and behavioral \\nabnormalities that are not reversible, even if the hematologic \\nand other metabolic complications are treated. Although the \\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends \\nenvironmental investigation at blood lead levels of 20  µg/dL \\non a single visit or persistent 15 µg/dL over a 3-month period, \\nlevels of 5-10 µg/dL may cause learning problems. Risk factors \\nfor lead intoxication include living in older homes with cracked \\nor peeling lead-based paint, industrial exposure, use of foreign \\nremedies (e.g., a diarrhea remedy from Central or South \\nAmerica), and use of pottery with lead paint glaze. Because \\nof the significant association of lead intoxication with poverty, \\nthe CDC recommends routine blood lead screening at 12 and 24 \\nmonths. In addition, standardized screening questions for risk \\nof lead intoxication should be asked for all children between 6 \\nmonths and 6 years of age (Table 9.2). Any positive or suspect \\nresponse is an indication for obtaining a blood lead level. Capil-\\nlary blood sampling may produce false-positive results; thus, \\nin most situations, a venous blood sample should be obtained \\nor a mechanism implemented to get children tested with a \\nvenous sample if they had an elevated capillary level. County \\nhealth departments, community organizations, and private \\ncompanies provide lead inspection and detection services to \\ndetermine the source of the lead. Standard decontamination \\ntechniques should be used to remove the lead while avoid-\\ning aerosolizing the toxic metal that a child might breathe \\nor creating dust that a child might ingest (see Chapters 149  \\nand 150).\\nTuberculosis Testing\\nThe prevalence of tuberculosis is increasing largely as a result \\nof the adult HIV epidemic. Children often present with serious \\nand multisystem disease (miliary tuberculosis). All children \\nshould be assessed for risk of tuberculosis at health maintenance \\nvisits at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. \\nTABLE 9.2 Lead Poisoning Risk Assessment Questions to \\nBe Asked Between 6 Months and 6 Years\\nDoes the child spend any time in a building built before 1960 \\n(e.g., home, school, barn) that has cracked or peeling paint?\\nIs there a brother, sister, housemate, playmate, or community \\nmember being followed or treated (or even rumored to be) for \\nlead poisoning?\\nDoes the child live with an adult whose job or hobby involves \\nexposure to lead (e.g., lead smelting and automotive radiator \\nrepair)?\\nDoes the child live near an active lead smelter, battery recycling \\nplant, or other industry likely to release lead?\\nDoes the family use home remedies or pottery from another \\ncountry?\\nTABLE 9.3 Groups at High Risk for Tuberculosis\\nClose contact with persons known to have tuberculosis (TB), \\npositive TB test, or suspected to have TB\\nForeign-born persons from areas with high TB rates (Asia, Africa, \\nLatin America, Eastern Europe, Russia)\\nHealth care workers\\nHigh-risk racial or ethnic minorities or other populations at higher \\nrisk (Asian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic, African American, Native \\nAmerican, groups living in poverty [e.g., Medicaid recipients], \\nmigrant farm workers, homeless persons, substance abusers)\\nInfants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk \\ncategories\\nTABLE 9.4 Cholesterol Risk Screening Recommendations\\nRisk screening at ages 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and annually in adolescence:\\n1.

Anticipatory guidance that \\nis age relevant is another part of the Bright Futures Guidelines. \\nThe Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit includes the topics \\nand one-page handouts for families (and for older children) \\nabout the highest yield issues for the specific age. Table 9.5 \\nsummarizes representative issues that might be discussed. It \\nis important to review briefly the safety topics previously \\ndiscussed at other visits for reinforcement. Age-appropriate \\ndiscussions should occur at each visit.\\nSafety Issues\\nThe most common cause of death for infants 1 month to 1 \\nyear of age is motor vehicle crashes. No newborn should be \\ndischarged from a nursery unless the parents have a functioning \\nand properly installed car seat. Many automobile dealerships \\noffer services to parents to ensure that safety seats are installed \\nproperly in their specific model. Most states have laws that \\nmandate the use of safety seats until the child reaches 4 years \\nof age or at least 40 pounds in weight. The following are age-\\nappropriate recommendations for car safety:\\n1. I nfants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing safety seat \\nuntil they are 2 years of age or until they reach the highest \\nweight or height allowed by the safety seat manufacturer.\\n2. T oddlers and preschoolers over age 2 or who have outgrown \\nthe rear-facing car seat should use a forward-facing car \\nseat with harness for as long as possible up to the highest \\nweight or height recommended by the manufacturer.\\n3. S chool-age children, whose weight or height is above the \\nforward-facing limit for their car seat, should use a belt-\\npositioning booster seat until the vehicle seat belt fits \\nproperly, typically when they have reached 4 ft 9  in. in h eight \\nand are between 8 and 12 years of age.\\n4. O lder children should always use lap and shoulder seat \\nbelts for optimal protection. All children younger than 13 \\nyears should be restrained in the rear seats of vehicles for \\noptimal protection. This is specifically to protect them from \\nairbags, which may cause more injury than the crash in \\nyoung children.\\nThe Back to Sleep  initiative has reduced the incidence of \\nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Before the initiative, \\ninfants routinely were placed prone to sleep. Since 1992, when \\nthe AAP recommended this program, the annual SIDS rate \\nhas decreased by more than 50%. Another initiative is aimed \\nat day care providers, because 20% of SIDS deaths occur in \\nday care settings.\\nFostering Optimal Development\\nSee Table 9.5 as well as the Bright Futures Recommendations \\n(Fig. 9.1; also found at http://brightfutures.aap.org/clinical_\\npractice.html) for presentation of age-appropriate activities that \\nthe pediatrician may advocate for families.\\nDiscipline means to teach, not merely to punish. The \\nultimate goal is the child’s self-control. Overbearing punish -\\nment to control a child’s behavior interferes with the learning \\nprocess and focuses on external control at the expense of the \\nconfidential fashion (see Section 12). Part of this evaluation \\nis a comprehensive sexual history that often requires creative \\nquestioning. Not all adolescents identify oral sex as sex, and \\nsome adolescents misinterpret the term sexually active to mean \\nthat one has many sexual partners or is very vigorous during \\nintercourse. The questions, “ Are you having sex?” and “Have \\nyou ever had sex?” should be asked. In the Bright Futures \\nGuidelines, any child or adolescent who has had any form \\nof sexual intercourse should have at least an annual evalu-\\nation (more often if there is a history of high-risk sex) for \\nsexually transmitted diseases by physical examination (genital \\nwarts, genital herpes, and pediculosis) and laboratory testing \\n(chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV) (see Chapter 116). \\nY oung women should be assessed for human papillomavirus \\nand precancerous lesions by Papanicolaou smear at 21 years  \\nof age.\\nDepression Screening\\nAll adolescents, starting at age 11, should have annual depression \\nscreening with a validated tool. The Patient Health Question-\\nnaires (PHQ) are commonly used. Both the short PHQ2  \\nand its slightly longer PHQ9 are available on the Bright  \\nFutures website in the Tool and Resource Kit at https://\\nbrightfutures.aap.org/materials-and-tools/tool-and-resource-kit/\\nPages/default.aspx.\\nIMMUNIZATIONS\\nImmunization records should be checked at each office visit \\nregardless of the reason. Appropriate vaccinations should be \\nadministered (see Chapter 94).\\nDENTAL CARE\\nMany families in the United States, particularly poor families \\nand ethnic minorities, underuse dental health care. Pediatricians \\nmay identify gross abnormalities, such as large caries, gingival \\ninflammation, or significant malocclusion. All children should \\nhave a dental examination by a dentist at least annually and a \\ndental cleaning by a dentist or hygienist every 6 months. Dental \\nhealth care visits should include instruction about preventive \\ncare practiced at home (brushing and flossing). Other prophy-\\nlactic methods shown to be effective at preventing caries are \\nconcentrated fluoride topical treatments (dental varnish) and \\nacrylic sealants on the molars. A new change for the Bright \\nFutures 4th Edition is the recommendation for Pediatricians \\nto apply dental fluoride varnish to infants and children every \\n3-6 months between 9 months and 5 years. Pediatric dentists \\nrecommend beginning visits at age 1 year to educate families \\nand to screen for milk bottle caries. Fluoridation of water \\nor fluoride supplements in communities that do not have \\nfluoridation are important in the prevention of cavities (see  \\nChapter 127).\\nNUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT\\nPlotting a child’s growth on the standard charts is a vital \\ncomponent of the nutritional assessment. A dietary history \\nshould be obtained because the content of the diet may \\nsuggest a risk of nutritional deficiency (see Chapters 27  \\nand 28).\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In all situations, to be effective, punishment must be \\nbrief and linked directly to a behavior. More effective behavioral \\nchange occurs when punishment also is linked to praise of the \\nintended behavior.\\nExtinction is an effective and systematic way to eliminate a \\nfrequent, annoying, and relatively harmless behavior by ignoring \\nit. First parents should note the frequency of the behavior to \\nappreciate realistically the magnitude of the problem and to \\nevaluate progress. Parents must determine what reinforces the \\nchild’s behavior and what needs to be consistently eliminated. \\nAn appropriate behavior is identified to give the child a positive \\nalternative that the parents can reinforce. Parents should be \\nwarned that the annoying behavior usually increases in frequency \\nand intensity (and may last for weeks) before it decreases when \\nthe parent ignores it (removes the reinforcement). A child who \\nhas an attention-seeking temper tantrum should be ignored or \\nplaced in a secure environment. This action may anger the child \\nmore, and the behavior may get louder and angrier. Eventually \\nwith no audience for the tantrum, the tantrums decrease in \\nintensity and frequency. In each specific instance, when the \\nchild’s behavior has become appropriate, he or she should be \\npraised, and extra attention should be given. This is an effective \\ntechnique for early toddlers, before their capacity to understand \\nand adhere to a time-out develops.\\nThe time-out consists of a short period of isolation \\nimmediately after a problem behavior is observed. Time-out \\ninterrupts the behavior and immediately links it to an unpleas-\\nant consequence. This method requires considerable effort by \\nthe parents because the child does not wish to be isolated. A \\nparent may need to hold the child physically in time-out. In \\nthis situation, the parent should become part of the furniture \\nand should not respond to the child until the time-out period \\nis over. When established, a simple isolation technique, such as \\nmaking a child stand in the corner or sending a child to his or \\nher room, may be effective. If such a technique is not helpful, \\na more systematic procedure may be needed. One effective \\nprotocol for the time-out procedure involves interrupting the \\nchild’s play when the behavior occurs and having the child \\nsit in a dull, isolated place for a brief period, measured by a \\nportable kitchen timer (the clicking noises document that time \\nis passing and the bell alarm at the end signals the end of the \\npunishment). Time-out is simply punishment and is not a time \\nfor a young child to think about the behavior (these children \\ndo not possess the capacity for abstract thinking) or a time to \\nde-escalate the behavior. The amount of time-out should be \\nappropriate to the child’s short attention span. One minute \\nper year of a child’s age is recommended. This inescapable and \\nunpleasant consequence of the undesired behavior motivates \\nthe child to learn to avoid the behavior.\\ndevelopment of self-control. Parents who set too few reasonable \\nlimits may be frustrated by children who cannot control their \\nown behavior. Discipline should teach a child exactly what is \\nexpected by supporting and reinforcing positive behaviors and \\nresponding appropriately to negative behaviors with proper \\nlimits. It is more important and effective to reinforce good \\nbehavior than to punish bad behavior.\\nCommonly used techniques to control undesirable behaviors \\nin children include scolding, physical punishment, and threats. \\nThese techniques have potential adverse effects on children’s \\nsense of security and self-esteem. The effectiveness of scolding \\ndiminishes the more it is used. Scolding should not be allowed \\nto expand from an expression of displeasure about a specific \\nevent to derogatory statements about the child. Scolding also \\nmay escalate to the level of psychological abuse. It is important \\nto educate parents that they have a good child who does bad \\nthings from time to time , so parents do not think and tell the \\nchild that he or she is “bad. ”\\nFrequent mild physical punishment (corporal punish -\\nment) may become less effective over time and tempt the \\nparent to escalate the physical punishment, increasing the \\nrisk of child abuse. Corporal punishment teaches a child that \\nin certain situations it is proper to strike another person. \\nCommonly, in households that use spanking, older children \\nwho have been raised with this technique are seen respond -\\ning to younger sibling behavioral problems by hitting their  \\nsiblings.\\nThreats by parents to leave or to give up the child are perhaps \\nthe most psychologically damaging ways to control a child’s \\nbehavior. Children of any age may remain fearful and anxious \\nabout loss of the parent long after the threat is made; however, \\nmany children are able to see through empty threats. Threatening \\na mild loss of privileges (no video games for 1 week or grounding \\na teenager) may be appropriate, but the consequence must be \\nenforced if there is a violation.\\nParenting involves a dynamic balance between setting limits \\non the one hand and allowing and encouraging freedom of \\nexpression and exploration on the other. A child whose behavior \\nis out of control improves when clear limits on their behavior \\nare set and enforced. However, parents must agree on where \\nthe limit will be set and how it will be enforced. The limit and \\nthe consequence of breaking the limit must be clearly presented \\nto the child. Enforcement of the limit should be consistent and \\nfirm. Too many limits are difficult to learn and may thwart the \\nnormal development of autonomy. The limit must be reasonable \\nin terms of the child’s age, temperament, and developmental \\nlevel. To be effective, both parents (and other adults in the home) \\nmust enforce limits. Otherwise, children may effectively split \\nthe parents and seek to test the limits with the more indulgent \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

If the child is at \\nhigh risk for delay (e.g., prematurity), a structured follow-up \\nprogram to monitor the child’s progress may already exist. \\nUnder federal law, all children are entitled to assessments if \\nthere is a suspected developmental delay or a risk factor for \\ndelay (e.g., prematurity, failure to thrive, and parental mental \\nretardation [MR]). Special programs for children up to 3 \\nyears of age are developed by states to implement this policy. \\nDevelopmental interventions are arranged in conjunction \\nwith third-party payers with local programs funding the cost \\nonly when there is no insurance coverage. After 3 years of \\nage, development programs usually are administered by school \\ndistricts. Federal laws mandate that special education programs \\nbe provided for all children with developmental disabilities \\nfrom birth through 21 years of age.\\nChildren with special needs may be enrolled in pre-K \\nprograms with a therapeutic core, including visits to the \\nprogram by therapists, to work on challenges. Children who \\nare of traditional school age (kindergarten through secondary \\nschool) should be evaluated by the school district and pro-\\nvided an individualized educational plan (IEP)  to address \\nany deficiencies. An IEP may feature individual tutoring time \\n(resource time), placement in a special education program, \\nplacement in classes with children with severe behavioral \\nproblems, or other strategies to address deficiencies. As part \\nof the comprehensive evaluation of developmental/behavioral \\nissues, all children should receive a thorough medical assess-\\nment. A variety of other specialists may assist in the assess -\\nment and intervention, including subspecialist pediatricians \\n(e.g., neurology, orthopedics, psychiatry, developmental/\\nbehavioral), therapists (e.g., occupational, physical, oral-motor), \\nand others (e.g., psychologists, early childhood development  \\nspecialists).\\nMedical Assessment\\nThe physician’s main goals in team assessment are to identify \\nthe cause of the developmental dysfunction, if possible (often \\na specific cause is not found), and identify and interpret other \\nmedical conditions that have a developmental impact. The \\ncomprehensive history (Table 10.1) and physical examination \\n(Table 10.2) include a careful graphing of growth parameters \\nand an accurate description of dysmorphic features. Many of \\nthe diagnoses are rare or unusual diseases or syndromes. Many \\nof these diseases and syndromes are discussed further in Sections \\n9 and 24.\\nMotor Assessment\\nThe comprehensive neurological examination is an excellent \\nbasis for evaluating motor function, but it should be supple-\\nmented by an adaptive functional evaluation (see Chapter 179). \\nObserving the child at play aids assessment of function. Special-\\nists in early childhood development and therapists (especially \\noccupational and physical therapists who have experience with \\nchildren) can provide excellent input into the evaluation of \\nage-appropriate adaptive function.\\nPsychological Assessment\\nPsychological assessment includes the testing of cognitive ability \\n(Table 10.3) and the evaluation of personality and emotional \\nCHAPTER 10 \\nEvaluation of the Child With \\nSpecial Needs\\nChildren with disabilities, severe chronic illnesses, congenital \\ndefects, and health-related educational and behavioral problems \\nare children with special health care needs (SHCN). Many \\nof these children share a broad group of experiences and \\nencounter similar problems, such as school difficulties and \\nfamily stress. The term children with special health care needs \\ndefines these children noncategorically, without regard to specific \\ndiagnoses, in terms of increased service needs. Approximately \\n19% of children in the United States younger than 18 years of \\nage have a physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional \\ncondition requiring services of a type or amount beyond those \\ngenerally required by most children.\\nThe goal in managing a child with SHCN is to maximize the \\nchild’s potential for productive adult functioning by treating \\nthe primary diagnosis and by helping the patient and family \\ndeal with the stresses and secondary impairments incurred \\nbecause of the disease or disability. Whenever a chronic disease \\nis diagnosed, family members typically grieve, show anger, \\ndenial, negotiation (in an attempt to forestall the inevitable), \\nand depression. Because the child with SHCN is a constant \\nreminder of the object of this grief, it may take family members \\na long time to accept the condition. A supportive physician can \\nfacilitate the process of acceptance by education and by allaying \\nguilty feelings and fear. To minimize denial, it is helpful to \\nconfirm the family’s observations about the child. The family \\nmay not be able to absorb any additional information initially, \\nso written material and the option for further discussion at a \\nlater date should be offered.\\nThe primary physician should provide a medical home to \\nmaintain close oversight of treatments and subspecialty services, \\nprovide preventive care, and facilitate interactions with school \\nand community agencies. A major goal of family-centered care is \\nfor the family and child to feel in control. Although the medical \\nmanagement team usually directs treatment in the acute health \\ncare setting, the locus of control should shift to the family as the \\nchild moves into a more routine, home-based life. Treatment \\nplans should allow the greatest degree of normalization of the \\nchild’s life. As the child matures, self-management programs that \\nprovide health education, self-efficacy skills, and techniques such \\nas symptom monitoring help promote good long-term health \\nhabits. These programs should be introduced at 6 or 7 years of \\nage or when a child is at a developmental level to take on chores \\nand benefit from being given responsibility. Self-management \\nminimizes learned helplessness and the vulnerable child syndrome, \\nboth of which occur commonly in families with chronically ill \\nor disabled children.\\nMULTIFACETED TEAM ASSESSMENT OF \\nCOMPLEX PROBLEMS\\nWhen developmental screening and surveillance suggest the \\npresence of significant developmental lags, the physician should \\ntake responsibility for coordinating the further assessment of \\nthe child by the team of professionals and provide continuity \\nof care. The physician should become aware of local facilities \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A home visit by a social worker, \\ncommunity health nurse, and/or home-based intervention \\nspecialist can provide valuable information about the child’s \\nsocial milieu. Often, the home visitor can suggest additional \\nadaptive equipment or renovations if there are challenges at \\nhome. If there is a suspicion of inadequate parenting, and, \\nespecially, if there is a suspicion of neglect or abuse (includ-\\ning emotional abuse), the child and family must be referred \\nto the local child protection agency.

The primary care physician \\nshould monitor the progress of the child and continually reassess \\nthat the requisite therapy is being accomplished.\\nEducational intervention for a young child begins as home-\\nbased infant stimulation, often with an early childhood specialist \\n(e.g., nurse/therapist), providing direct stimulation for the child \\nand training the family to provide the stimulation. As the child \\nmatures, a center-based early learning center program may be \\nindicated. For the school-age child, special services may range \\nfrom extra attention in the classroom to a self-contained special \\neducation classroom.\\nPsychological intervention may be directed to the parent \\nor family or, with an older child, primarily child-directed. \\nExamples of therapeutic approaches are guidance therapies, \\nsuch as directive advice giving, counseling to create their own \\nsolutions to problems, psychotherapy, behavioral management \\ntechniques, psychopharmacologic methods (from a psychiatrist), \\nand cognitive-behavioral therapy.\\nMotor intervention may be performed by a physical or \\noccupational therapist. Neurodevelopmental therapy (NDT), \\nthe most commonly used method, is based on the concept \\nthat nervous system development is hierarchical and subject \\nto some plasticity. The focus of NDT is on gait training and \\nmotor development, including daily living skills; perceptual \\nabilities, such as eye-hand coordination; and spatial relation-\\nships. Sensory integration therapy is also used by occupational \\ntherapists to structure sensory experience from the tactile, pro-\\nprioceptive, and vestibular systems to allow for adaptive motor  \\nresponses.\\nSpeech-language intervention by a speech and language \\ntherapist/pathologist (oral-motor therapist) is usually part of \\nthe overall educational program and is based on the tested \\nlanguage strengths and weaknesses of the child. Children \\nneeding this type of intervention may show difficulties in reading \\nand other academic areas and develop social and behavioral \\nproblems because of their difficulties in being understood and \\nin understanding others. Hearing intervention, performed by \\nan audiologist (or an otolaryngologist), includes monitoring \\nhearing acuity and providing amplification when necessary \\nvia hearing aids.\\nSocial and environmental intervention generally includes \\nnursing or social work involvement with the family. Frequently, \\nthe task of coordinating services falls to these specialists. \\nCase managers may be in the private sector, from the child’s \\ninsurance or Medicaid plan, or part of a child protection  \\nagency.\\nMedical intervention  for a child with a developmental \\ndisability involves providing primary care as well as spe -\\ncific treatment of conditions associated with the disability. \\nAlthough curative treatment often is not possible, functional \\nimpairment can be minimized through thoughtful medical \\nmanagement. Certain general medical problems are found \\nmore frequently in delayed and developmentally disabled \\npeople (Table 10.5), especially if the delay is part of a known \\nsyndrome. Some children may have a limited life expectancy. \\nSupporting the family through palliative care, hospice, and \\nbereavement is another important role of the primary care  \\npediatrician.\\nTABLE 10.4 Primary Care Counseling Roles\\nAllow ventilation\\nFacilitate clarification\\nSupport patient problem solving\\nProvide specific reassurance\\nProvide education\\nProvide specific parenting advice\\nSuggest environmental interventions\\nProvide follow-up\\nFacilitate appropriate referrals\\nCoordinate care and interpret reports after referrals\\nemotions may allow the parent or caregiver to move on to the \\nwork of understanding and resolving the problem.\\nInterview techniques may facilitate clarification of the \\nproblem for the family and for the clinician. The family’s ideas \\nabout the causes of the problem and attempts at coping can \\nprovide a basis for developing strategies for problem manage-\\nment that are much more likely to be implemented successfully \\nbecause they emanate, in part, from the family. The clinician \\nshows respect by endorsing the parent’s ideas when appropriate; \\nthis can increase self-esteem and sense of competency.\\nEducating parents about normal and aberrant development \\nand behavior may prevent problems through early detection \\nand anticipatory guidance and communicates the physician’s \\ninterest in hearing parental concerns. Early detection allows \\nintervention before the problem becomes entrenched and \\nassociated problems develop.\\nThe severity of developmental and behavioral problems \\nranges from variations of normal to problematic responses to \\nstressful situations to frank disorders. The clinician must try \\nto establish the severity and scope of the patient’s symptoms \\nso that appropriate intervention can be planned.\\nCounseling Principles\\nFor the child, behavioral change must be learned, not simply \\nimposed. It is easiest to learn when the lesson is simple, clear, \\nand consistent and presented in an atmosphere free of fear or \\nintimidation. Parents often try to impose behavioral change in \\nan emotionally charged atmosphere, most often at the time of \\na behavioral violation. Similarly, clinicians may try to teach \\nparents with hastily presented advice when the parents are \\ndistracted by other concerns or not engaged in the suggested \\nbehavioral change.\\nApart from management strategies directed specifically at \\nthe problem behavior, regular times for positive parent-child \\ninteraction should be instituted. Frequent, brief, affectionate \\nphysical contact over the day provides opportunities for positive \\nreinforcement of desirable child behaviors and for building a \\nsense of competence in the child and the parent.\\nMost parents feel guilty when their children have a \\ndevelopmental/behavioral problem. Guilt may be caused by \\nthe fear that the problem was caused by inadequate parenting or \\nby previous angry responses to the child’s behavior. If possible \\nand appropriate, the clinician should find ways to alleviate \\nguilt, which may be a serious impediment to problem solving.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Mild \\nMR correlates with socioeconomic status, although profound \\nMR does not. Although a single organic cause may be found, \\neach individual’s performance should be considered a func-\\ntion of the interaction of environmental influences with the \\nindividual’s organic substrate. Behavioral difficulties resulting \\nfrom MR itself and from the family’s reaction to the child and \\nthe condition are common. More severe forms of MR can be \\ntraced to biological factors. The earlier the cognitive slowing is \\nrecognized, the more severe the deviation from normal is likely  \\nto be.\\nThe first step in the diagnosis and management of a child \\nwith MR is to identify functional strengths and weaknesses for \\npurposes of medical and rehabilitative therapies. A history and \\nphysical examination may suggest a diagnostic approach that, \\nthen, may be confirmed by laboratory testing and/or imaging. \\nFrequently used laboratory tests include chromosomal analysis \\nand magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Almost one-third \\nof individuals with MR do not have readily identifiable reasons \\nfor their disability.\\nVision Impairment\\nSignificant visual impairment is a problem in many children. \\nPartial vision (defined as visual acuity between 20/70 and \\n20/200) occurs in 1 in 500 school-age children in the United \\nStates. Legal blindness is defined as distant visual acuity of \\n20/200 or worse and affects about 35,000 children in the United \\nStates. Such impairment can be a major barrier to optimal \\ndevelopment.\\nThe most common cause of severe visual impairment  \\nin children is retinopathy of prematurity (see Chapter 61). \\nCongenital cataracts may lead to significant amblyopia. \\nCataracts also are associated with other ocular abnormalities \\nand developmental disabilities. Amblyopia is a pathologic \\nalteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in \\nvisual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent \\norganic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. \\nAmblyopia is due to a distortion of the normal clearly formed \\nretinal image (from congenital cataracts or severe refractive \\nerrors); abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes, as \\none eye competitively inhibits the other (strabismus); or a \\ncombination of both mechanisms. Albinism, hydrocephalus, \\ncongenital cytomegalovirus infection, and birth asphyxia are \\nother significant contributors to blindness in children.\\nSELECTED CLINICAL PROBLEMS: THE \\nSPECIAL NEEDS CHILD\\nMental Retardation\\nMR is defined as significantly subnormal intellectual functioning \\nfor a child’s developmental stage, existing concurrently with \\ndeficits in adaptive behaviors (self-care, home living, com-\\nmunication, and social interactions). MR is defined statistically \\nas cognitive performance that is two standard deviations below \\nthe mean (roughly below the third percentile) of the general \\npopulation as measured on standardized intelligence testing. \\nThe last known estimate of the prevalence of MR is that about \\n2% of the U.S. population is affected.

Fixation and visual tracking \\nbehavior can be seen in most infants by 6 weeks of age. This \\nbehavior can be assessed by moving a brightly colored object \\n(or the examiner’s face) across the visual field of a quiet but alert \\ninfant at a distance of 1 ft. Th e eyes also should be examined for \\nred reflexes and pupillary reactions to light. Optical alignment \\n(binocular vision with both eyes consistently focusing on the \\nsame spot) should not be expected until the infant is beyond \\nthe newborn period. Persistent nystagmus is abnormal at any \\nage. If ocular abnormalities are identified, referral to a pediatric \\nophthalmologist is indicated.\\nDuring the newborn period, vision may be assessed by \\nphysical examination and by visual evoked response. This test \\nevaluates the conduction of electrical impulses from the optic \\nnerve to the occipital cortex of the brain. The eye is stimulated \\nby a bright flash of light or with an alternating checkerboard of \\nblack-and-white squares, and the resulting electrical response \\nis recorded from electrodes strategically placed on the scalp, \\nsimilar to an electroencephalogram.\\nThere are many developmental implications of visual impair-\\nment. Perception of body image is abnormal, and imitative \\nbehavior, such as smiling, is delayed. Delays in mobility may \\noccur in children who are visually impaired from birth, although \\ntheir postural milestones (ability to sit) usually are achieved \\nappropriately.

The tests \\nare sensitive but not as specific as more definitive tests. Infants \\nwho do not pass these tests are referred for more comprehensive \\ntesting. Many of these infants have normal hearing on definitive \\ntesting. Infants who do not have normal hearing should be \\nimmediately evaluated or referred for etiologic diagnosis and \\nearly intervention.\\nFor children not screened at birth (such as children of \\nimmigrant parents) or children with suspected acquired hearing \\nloss, later testing may allow early appropriate intervention. \\nHearing can be screened by means of an office audiogram, \\nbut other techniques are needed (ABR, behavior audiology) for \\nyoung, neurologically immature or impaired, and behaviorally \\ndifficult children. The typical audiologic assessment includes \\npure-tone audiometry over a variety of sound frequencies \\n(pitches), especially over the range of frequencies in which \\nmost speech occurs. Pneumatic otoscopic examination and \\ntympanometry are used to assess middle ear function and the \\ntympanic membrane compliance for pathology in the middle \\near, such as fluid, ossicular dysfunction, and eustachian tube \\ndysfunction (see Chapter 9).\\nThe treatment of conductive hearing loss (largely due to \\notitis media and middle ear effusions) is discussed in Chapter \\n105. Treatment of sensorineural hearing impairment may be \\nmedical or surgical. If amplification is indicated, hearing aids \\ncan be tuned preferentially to amplify the frequency ranges in \\nwhich the patient has decreased acuity. Educational interven-\\ntion typically includes speech-language therapy and teaching \\nAmerican Sign Language. Even with amplification, many \\nhearing-impaired children show deficits in processing auditory \\ninformation, requiring special educational services for helping \\nto read and for other academic skills. Cochlear implants are \\nsurgically implantable devices that provide hearing sensation to \\nindividuals with severe to profound hearing loss. The implants \\nare designed to substitute for the function of the middle ear, \\ncochlear mechanical motion, and sensory cells, transforming \\nsound energy into electrical energy that initiates impulses in \\nthe auditory nerve. Cochlear implants are indicated for children \\nolder than 12 months with profound bilateral sensorineural \\nhearing loss who have limited benefit from hearing aids, have \\nfailed to progress in auditory skill development, and have no \\nradiologic or medical contraindications. Implantation in children \\nas young as possible gives them the most advantageous auditory \\nenvironment for speech-language learning.\\nSpeech-Language Impairment\\nParents often bring the concern of speech delay to the physician’s \\nattention when they compare their young child with others of \\nthe same age (Table 10.9). The most common causes of the \\nspeech delay are MR, hearing impairment, social deprivation, \\nautism, and oral-motor abnormalities. If a problem is suspected \\nbased on screening with tests such as Ages and Stages Question-\\nnaires or the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status test \\n(see Chapter 8) or other standard screening test (Early Language \\nMilestone Scale), a referral to a specialized hearing and speech \\ncenter is indicated. While awaiting the results of testing or \\ninitiation of speech-language therapy, parents should be advised \\nto speak slowly and clearly to the child (and avoid baby talk). \\nParents and older siblings should read frequently to the speech-\\ndelayed child.\\nTABLE 10.9 Clues to When a Child With a \\nCommunication Disorder Needs Help\\n0-11 MONTHS\\nBefore 6 months, the child does not startle, blink, or change \\nimmediate activity in response to sudden, loud sounds.\\nBefore 6 months, the child does not attend to the human voice \\nand is not soothed by mother’s voice.\\nBy 6 months, the child does not babble strings of consonant and \\nvowel syllables or imitate gurgling or cooing sounds.\\nBy 10 months, the child does not respond to his or her name.\\nAt 10 months, the child’s sound-making is limited to shrieks, \\ngrunts, or sustained vowel production.\\n12-23 MONTHS\\nAt 12 months, the child’s babbling or speech is limited to vowel \\nsounds.\\nBy 15 months, the child does not respond to “no,” “bye-bye,” or \\n“bottle.”\\nBy 15 months, the child does not imitate sounds or words.\\nBy 18 months, the child is not consistently using at least six words \\nwith appropriate meaning.\\nBy 21 months, the child does not respond correctly to “Give \\nme…,” “Sit down,” or “Come here” when spoken without \\ngestural cues.\\nBy 23 months, two-word phrases that are spoken as single units \\n(e.g., “whatszit,” “thankyou,” “allgone”) have not emerged.\\n24-36 MONTHS\\nBy 24 months, at least 50% of the child’s speech is not \\nunderstood by familiar listeners.\\nBy 24 months, the child does not point to body parts without \\ngestural cues.\\nBy 24 months, the child is not combining words into phrases (e.g., \\n“go bye-bye,” “go car,” “want cookie”).\\nBy 30 months, the child does not show understanding of spatial \\nconcepts: on, in, under, front, and back.\\nBy 30 months, the child is not using short sentences (e.g., “Daddy \\nwent bye-bye”).\\nBy 30 months, the child has not begun to ask questions (using \\nwhere, what, why).\\nBy 36 months, the child’s speech is not understood by unfamiliar \\nlisteners.\\nALL AGES\\nAt any age, the child is consistently dysfluent with repetitions, \\nhesitations; blocks or struggles to say words.

It results from injury to the upper \\nmotor neurons of the pyramidal tract. It may occasionally be \\nbilateral. It is characterized by at least two of the following: \\nabnormal movement pattern, increased tone, or pathologic \\nreflexes (e.g., Babinski response, hyperreflexia).\\nDyskinetic cerebral palsy: occurs in 10-15% of cases. It is \\ndominated by abnormal patterns of movement and involuntary, \\nuncontrolled, recurring movements.\\nAtaxic cerebral palsy: accounts for <5% of cases. This form \\nresults from cerebellar injury and features abnormal posture or \\nmovement and loss of orderly muscle coordination or both.\\nDystonic cerebral palsy: also uncommon. It is characterized by \\nreduced activity and stiff movement (hypokinesia) and hypotonia.\\nChoreoathetotic cerebral palsy: rare now that excessive \\nhyperbilirubinemia is aggressively prevented and treated. This \\nform is dominated by increased and stormy movements \\n(hyperkinesia) and hypotonia.\\nMixed cerebral palsy: accounts for 10-15% of cases. This term is \\nused when more than one type of motor pattern is present and \\nwhen one pattern does not clearly dominate another. It typically is \\nassociated with more complications, including sensory deficits, \\nseizures, and cognitive-perceptual impairments.\\nPEARLS FOR PRACTITIONERS\\nCHAPTER 5\\nNormal Growth\\n• Standard growth charts are used; they are available free from \\nthe CDC\\n• 0-2 years, use the WHO growth charts and measure \\nweight, recumbent length, and head circumference and \\nplot these as well as the weight for length\\n• For >2 years, use the CDC growth charts and measure \\nweight, standing height, and calculate BMI.

Paul |  C olleen M. Wallace\\nCHAPTER 11 \\nCrying and Colic\\nInfant crying can be a sign of pain, distress, hunger, or fatigue \\nand is interpreted by caregivers according to the context of the \\ncrying. The cry just after birth heralds the infant’s health and \\nvigor. The screams of the same infant, 6 weeks later, may be \\ninterpreted as a sign of illness, difficult temperament, or poor \\nparenting. Crying is a manifestation of infant arousal influenced \\nby the environment and interpreted through the lens of the \\nfamily, social, and cultural context.\\nNORMAL DEVELOPMENT\\nCrying is best understood by the characteristics of timing, \\nduration, frequency, intensity, and modifiability of the cry (Fig. \\n11.1). Most infants cry little during the first 2 weeks of life, \\ngradually increasing to an average of 3 hours per day by 6 weeks \\nand decreasing to an average of 1 hour per day by 12 weeks.\\nCry duration differs by culture and infant care practices. For \\nexample, Kung San hunter–gatherer infants, who are continu-\\nously carried and fed four times per hour, cry 50% less than \\ninfants in the United States. Crying may also relate to health \\nstatus and gestational age. Premature infants cry little before 40 \\nweeks gestational age but tend to cry more than term infants at \\n6 weeks’ corrected age. Crying behavior in former premature \\ninfants also may be influenced by ongoing medical conditions, \\nsuch as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, visual impairments, and \\nfeeding disorders. The duration of crying is often modifiable \\nby caregiving strategies.\\nFrequency of crying is less variable than duration of crying. \\nAt 6 weeks of age, the mean frequency of combined crying and \\nfussing is 10 episodes in 24 hours. Diurnal variation in crying \\nis the norm, with crying concentrated in the late afternoon \\nand evening.\\nThe intensity of infant crying varies, with descriptions \\nranging from fussing to screaming. An intense infant cry (pitch \\nand loudness) is more likely to elicit concern or even alarm \\nfrom parents and caregivers than an infant who frets more \\nquietly. Pain cries of newborns are remarkably loud: 80  dB \\nat a distance of 30.5  cm f rom the infant’s mouth. Although \\npain cries have a higher frequency than hunger cries, when \\nnot attended to for a protracted period, hunger cries become \\nacoustically similar to pain cries. Fortunately, most infant crying \\nis of a lesser intensity, consistent with fussing.\\nCOLIC\\nColic often is diagnosed using Wessel’s rule of threes—crying \\nfor more than 3 hours per day, at least 3 days per week, for \\nmore than 3 weeks. The limitations of this definition include \\nthe lack of specificity of the word crying (e.g., does this include \\nfussing?) and the necessity to wait 3 weeks to make a diagnosis \\nin an infant who has excessive crying. Colicky crying is often \\ndescribed as paroxysmal and may be characterized by facial \\ngrimacing, leg flexion, and passing flatus.\\nEtiology\\nFewer than 5% of infants evaluated for excessive crying have \\nan organic etiology, with no known association with feeding \\nmethod or family history of food allergy or atopy. The etiology \\nof colic is unknown and is likely multifactorial in etiology. \\nSince it is a diagnosis of exclusion, evaluation of infants with \\nexcessive crying is necessary in order to rule out other serious \\ndiagnoses.\\nEpidemiology\\nCumulative incidence rates of colic vary from 5% to 28% in \\ndifferent studies that vary by definition of colic and method \\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n23456789 10 11 12\\nHours of fussing per day\\nMedian\\nUpper \\nquartile\\nLower \\nquartile\\nAge (wk)\\nFIGURE 11.1  Distribution of total crying time among 80 infants \\nstudied from 2-12 weeks of age.

A thorough inspection of the infant is important to \\nidentify possible sources of pain, including skin lesions, corneal \\nabrasions, hair tourniquets,  or signs of child abuse such as \\nbruising or fractures (see Chapters 22 and 198). Other infant \\nconditions that commonly cause pain include acute otitis media, \\nurinary tract infections, oral ulcerations, and insect bites. A \\nneurologic examination may reveal previously undiagnosed \\nneurologic conditions, such as perinatal brain injuries. Observing \\nthe infant during a crying episode (or reviewing a recording of \\nan episode) can be invaluable in assessing the infant’s potential \\nfor calming and the parents’ skills in soothing the infant.\\nLaboratory and imaging studies are warranted when the \\nhistory or physical examination findings suggest an organic cause \\nfor excessive crying.

It is important to reassure parents that \\nthere is no evidence that infants with colic have adverse long-\\nterm outcomes in health or temperament after the affected \\nperiod. Similarly, infantile colic does not have untoward long-\\nterm effects on maternal mental health, as parental distress \\ntends to resolve as colic subsides.\\nCHAPTER 12 \\nTemper Tantrums\\nTemper tantrums are a very common childhood behavioral \\ncondition, which commonly cause concern for parents, prompt-\\ning presentation to pediatric care providers and referrals to \\nbehavioral consultants.\\nTemper tantrums can be defined as episodes of extreme \\nfrustration and anger that manifest in an array of signs ranging \\nfrom whining, screaming, stomping, hitting, head banging, and \\nfalling to more severe actions such as breath holding, vomiting, \\nand aggression, including biting. Tantrums are seen most often \\nwhen the young child experiences frustration, anger, or simple \\ninability to cope with a situation. The behavior appears very \\ndisproportionate to the situation, and the child often appears \\nto be “out of control. ”\\nETIOLOGY\\nTemper tantrums are believed to be a normal human devel-\\nopmental stage. Child temperament may be a determinant of \\ntantrum behavior.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nTemper tantrums are considered part of typical behavior in \\n1- to 4-year-old children. In U.S. studies, 50-80% of 2- to \\n3-year-old children have had regular tantrums, and 20% are \\nreported to have daily tantrums. The behavior appears to peak \\nlate in the third year of life; however, approximately 20% of \\n4-year-olds are still having regular temper tantrums, and 10% \\nof 4-year-old children have tantrums at least once a day. \\nExplosive temper occurs in approximately 5% of school-aged \\nchildren. Tantrums occur equally in boys and girls during the \\npreschool period.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nIt is important to recognize that there is not one set of behaviors \\nthat reliably differentiates typical and abnormal temper tantrums. \\nHowever, some concerning elements that may signal abnormal \\ntantrums are summarized and contrasted with typical tantrum \\ncharacteristics in Table 12.1. Atypical tantrums (especially those \\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis for colic is broad and includes any \\ncondition that can cause pain or discomfort in the infant, \\nincluding those above, as well as conditions associated with \\nnonpainful distress, such as fatigue or sensory overload. Cow’s \\nmilk protein intolerance, gastroesophageal reflux disease \\n(GERD), maternal substance use including nicotine, and \\nanomalous left coronary artery all have been reported as causes \\nof persistent crying. In addition, situations associated with poor \\ninfant regulation, including fatigue, hunger, parental anxiety, \\nand chaotic environmental conditions, may increase the risk \\nof excessive crying. In most cases, the cause of crying in infants \\nis unexplained. If the condition began before 3 weeks’ corrected \\nage, the crying has a diurnal pattern consistent with colic \\n(afternoon and evening clustering), the infant is otherwise \\ndeveloping and thriving, and no organic cause is found, a \\ndiagnosis of colic may be made.\\nAnticipatory Guidance and Management\\nThe management of colic begins with education and demystifica-\\ntion. When the family and the physician are reassured that the \\ninfant is healthy, education about the normal pattern of infant \\ncrying is appropriate. Anticipatory guidance should also be \\nprovided regarding atypical crying that warrants further medical \\nattention. Learning about the temporal pattern of colic can be \\nreassuring; the mean crying duration begins to decrease at 6 \\nweeks of age and decreases by half by 12 weeks of age. Colic \\nfrequently resolves by 3 months of age. Approximately 15%  \\nof infants with colic continue to have excessive crying after \\nthis age.\\nHelping families develop caregiving strategies for the infant’s \\nfussy period is useful. Techniques for calming infants include \\nDr. Harvey Karp’s “5 Ss”: swaddling, side or stomach holding, \\nsoothing noises (such as shushing, singing, or white noise), \\nswinging or slow rhythmic movement (such as rocking, walking, \\nor riding in a car), and sucking on a pacifier. Giving caregivers \\npermission to allow the infant to rest or leave the infant alone \\nin a safe place (such as a crib) when soothing strategies are \\nnot working may alleviate overstimulation in some infants; \\nthis also relieves families of guilt and allows them a wider \\nrange of responses to infant crying. It is important to encourage \\nparents to seek help and support from others when they are \\nbecoming overwhelmed and to advise against harmful methods \\nto soothe an infant (such as placing the infant on a vibrating \\nclothes dryer). Parents should be specifically educated about \\nthe dangers of shaking babies.\\nMedications, including phenobarbital, diphenhydramine, \\nalcohol, simethicone, dicyclomine, and lactase, have not been \\nshown to be of benefit and may cause serious side effects; \\nthey are, therefore, not recommended. Some early studies \\nhave suggested that probiotics may be useful, but results have \\nbeen conflicting, and further research is needed. Alternative \\ntreatments such as chamomile, fennel, vervain, licorice, and \\nbalm-mint teas have not been approved for use in infants and \\ncan cause serious side effects such as hyponatremia and anemia.\\nSome feeding measures may be helpful in alleviating the \\nsymptoms of colic. Educating parents regarding variable \\nhunger cues, avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol in nursing \\nmothers, ensuring adequate yet not excessive bottle nipple flow, \\nand cautioning against overfeeding may be helpful.

Helping the family identify the typical antecedents of \\nthe child’s tantrums is essential to evaluation and intervention. \\nFor example, a child who has tantrums only when he or she \\nmisses a routine nap can be treated differently than a child who \\nhas frequent tantrums related to minor difficulties or disap-\\npointments. Careful attention to the child’s daily routines may \\nreveal problems associated with hunger, fatigue, inadequate \\nphysical activity, or overstimulation.\\nThe physical examination focuses on discovering an underly-\\ning illness with symptoms that mimic temper tantrums or that \\ncan decrease the child’s ability to self-regulate. A full exam is \\nessential and includes vision and hearing and a developmental \\nexam. Speech and language delay can frustrate a child and \\nexacerbate tantrums. The examiner’s general observation is \\nvery helpful. Behavioral observations reveal a child’s ability to \\nfollow instructions, play with age-appropriate toys, and interact \\nwith parents and the clinician; observation of attention may be \\nespecially helpful in evaluating for ASD. Dysmorphic features \\nmay reveal a genetic syndrome, and a full skin exam may reveal \\nneurocutaneous stigma as well as evidence of child abuse (see \\nChapter 22). Neurological exam includes the general disposition \\nof the child, brief cognition assessment, and exploration for \\nneurological deficits that could suggest brain tumors or other \\nneurological conditions.\\nLaboratory studies screening for iron deficiency anemia, \\nsleep disturbance such as restless sleep, and lead exposure are \\nimportant. Other laboratory and imaging studies should be \\nreserved for situations where the history and physical examina-\\ntion suggest a possible underlying etiology.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMost children who have temper tantrums have no underlying \\nmedical problem.

Candidate genes include those involving the \\ndopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. \\nNeuroimaging studies (functional magnetic resonance imaging \\nand positron emission tomography) have shown structural and \\nfunctional differences, particularly of the frontal lobes, inferior \\nparietal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callus, and cerebellar \\nvermis. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated delay in \\ncortical maturation and suggest that the pathophysiological \\nfeatures include large-scale neuronal networks including frontal \\nto parietal cortical connections. Environmental links have been \\ndescribed with prenatal exposure to a variety of substances \\nincluding nicotine, alcohol, prescription medications, and illicit \\nsubstances. Environmental exposure to lead, organophosphate \\npesticides, or polychlorinated biphenyls has also been shown \\nto be a risk factor. Additionally, damage to the central nervous \\nsystem from trauma or infection can increase the risk  \\nof ADHD.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nU.S. prevalence rates for ADHD vary depending on criteria \\nused and population studied, with approximately 11% of U.S. \\nchildren diagnosed with ADHD today. The male to female \\nratio is 2-6:1, with greater male predominance for the \\nhyperactive/impulsive and combined types. Girls often present \\nwith inattentive symptoms and are more likely to be underdi-\\nagnosed or to receive later diagnoses. Symptoms of ADHD, \\nparticularly impulsivity and inattention, frequently persist past \\nchildhood, with up to 80% of those affected having symptoms \\ninto adolescence, and 40% into adulthood.\\nand other brain disorders are at increased risk for prolonged \\ntemper tantrum behavior. These children include former \\npremature infants and children with ASDs, traumatic brain \\ninjury, cognitive impairment, and Prader-Willi and Smith-\\nMagenis syndromes. Children with rare conditions, such as \\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia and precocious puberty, also \\nmay present with severe and persistent tantrums. Children \\nwith intellectual disability may exhibit tantrums when their \\ndevelopmental age is comparable to 3 to 4 years.\\nANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE AND \\nMANAGEMENT\\nIntervention begins with parental education about the nature \\nof typical temper tantrums, stressing that tantrums are a normal \\ndevelopmental phase. It is very important to guide parents’ \\nexpectations of their child’s tantrums as related to normal \\ndevelopment. Anticipatory guidance should occur at the \\n12-month well-child check, providing strategies for assisting \\nchildren with emotional regulation, and emphasizing the \\nimportance of regular routines for sleeping, eating, and safe \\nphysical activity.\\nThe clinician can help parents understand their role in \\nhelping the child by highlighting the importance of main -\\ntaining consistency regarding behavioral expectations and \\nconsequences, encouraging developmentally appropriate \\npositive and negative reinforcements, and structure in a child’s \\nenvironment. Reviewing the child’s daily routine is critical to \\nunderstanding if the tantrums are communicating essential \\nunmet needs. Parents should be educated on structuring the \\nenvironment, avoiding age-inappropriate demands on the child, \\nand addressing hunger, fatigue, loneliness, or hyperstimulation. \\nChildren who behave well all day at day care and exhibit temper \\ntantrums at home in the evening may be signaling fatigue or \\nneed for parental attention. Identification of underlying stress \\nis the cornerstone of treatment because many stressors can be  \\neliminated.\\nIn some cases, parents inadvertently reinforce tantrum \\nbehavior by complying with the child’s demands. Parental \\nambivalence about acceptable toddler behavior also may lead \\nto inconsistent expectations and restrictions. Helping parents \\nclarify what behavior is allowed and what is off limits can avert \\nthe temptation to give in when the child screams loudly or \\npublicly.\\nIt is important for parents to model positive behavior and \\navoid tantrum-like behavior themselves (e.g., yelling) and to \\navoid physical punishment, which in turn can encourage physical \\naggression by the child. Other helpful strategies include offering \\nchildren choices among acceptable alternatives, teaching alternate \\nways to communicate desires and frustrations (verbally, signing, \\netc.), and providing warnings prior to unpleasant transitions \\nsuch as leaving a place the child enjoys.\\nDistraction is an effective means of short-circuiting impend-\\ning tantrums. Physically removing the child from an environ-\\nment that is associated with the child’s difficulty is sometimes \\nhelpful. Further behavioral interventions are recommended only \\nafter engaging in strategies to help the child gain control by \\nmeeting basic needs, altering the environment, and anticipat-\\ning meltdowns. Recommended behavioral strategies include \\nbehavior modification with positive and negative reinforce -\\nment or extinction.

Symptoms must have been \\npresent prior to 12 years of age; evidence of significant impair-\\nment in social, academic, or work settings must occur; and \\nother mental disorders must be excluded. Changes incorporated \\ninto the fifth edition include the age prior to which symptoms \\nmust occur (to identify the subset of older children (frequently \\nfemale) who exhibit predominantly inattentive symptoms and \\nwho may not present with significant functional impairment \\nearly in childhood), the need for symptoms to occur in at least \\ntwo settings, and the decrease in number of symptoms to five \\nfor adolescents 17 years of age or older.\\nA physical examination is essential to identify medical \\n(e.g., neurologic, genetic) or developmental problems (e.g., \\ncognitive impairment, language disorder, learning disability, \\nautism spectrum disorder) that may underlie, coexist, or provide \\nan alternative explanation for the child’s behaviors. Observa-\\ntion of the child, the parents, and their interactions is part of \\nthe evaluation. Note that some children with ADHD will be \\nable to maintain focus without hyperactivity in environments \\nwith low stimulation and little distraction (e.g., clinician’s  \\noffice).\\nLaboratory and imaging studies should be considered with \\nthe aim to exclude other conditions. Consider thyroid function \\nstudies, blood lead levels, genetic studies, anemia screening, and \\nbrain imaging studies if clearly indicated by medical history, \\nenvironmental history, or physical examination.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis can be challenging given that \\nco-morbidities of ADHD overlap and intertwine with the \\ndifferential diagnoses. The diagnostic process should evaluate \\nfor other conditions such as sleep disorders, seizure disorders, \\nsubstance use, hyperthyroidism, lead intoxication, sensory \\nprocessing issues, and vision or auditory deficits as possible \\ncauses for a child’s hyperactivity and distractibility. Inatten-\\ntion and hyperactivity may be present as features of genetic \\ndisorders such as fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and \\nneurofibromatosis 1. Psychological stress (e.g., bullying, abuse) \\nand disruptive surroundings can also lead to symptoms of \\nhyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention and mimic indeed the \\nsymptoms of ADHD. Children who have symptoms of ADHD \\nin only one setting may be having problems due to cognitive \\ndisability, level of emotional maturity, or feelings of inadequate \\nwell-being in that setting. Overall, it is prudent to investigate \\nand ensure overall well-being including sleep and nutritional \\nhygiene before embarking on an extensive evaluation of  \\nADHD.\\nCo-morbidities\\nCo-morbidities are present in up to 60% of children with ADHD \\nsuch as anxiety, learning disabilities, language disorders, tic \\ndisorders, mood disorders, coordination problems, oppositional \\ndefiant disorder, and other conduct disorder. Tourette syndrome \\nand fragile X syndrome, in particular, are known conditions \\nwith associated ADHD. It is important to discern if the symp-\\ntoms are due to the co-morbidities independently or as a co-\\nmorbidity with ADHD.\\nClinical Symptoms\\nMany of the symptoms of ADHD mimic typical findings of \\nnormal development; thus it is important to consider whether \\nthe child’s symptoms are out of proportion to what would be \\nexpected for stage of development. Symptoms of inattention \\n(e.g., failing to pay close attention to details, appearing to not \\nlisten when spoken to directly), hyperactivity (e.g., being fidgety \\nor restless, leaving a seat when expected to remain seated),  \\nor impulsivity (e.g., blurting out answers before a question  \\nhas been completed) may indicate a diagnosis of ADHD  \\n(Table 13.1).\\nDiagnosis and Evaluation\\nADHD is diagnosed clinically by history. The reports of \\nparents, teachers, and others, including teenage self-report, are \\ncore to its diagnosis. The history should rely on open-ended \\nquestions as much as possible to explore specific behaviors \\nand their impact on academic performance, family and peer \\nrelationships, safety, self-esteem, and daily activities. However, \\nultimately, a diagnosis of ADHD requires that the symptoms \\nbe measured with validated rating scales to establish the  \\ndiagnosis.\\nTABLE 13.1 Key Diagnostic Symptoms of Attention-\\nDefcitt/yperactiiity Disorder\\nINATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS\\n•\\t Does\\tnot \\tgive \\tclose \\tattention \\tto \\tdetails \\tor \\tmakes \\tcareless \\t\\nmistakes\\n•\\t Has\\tdifficulty \\tsustaining \\tattention \\ton \\ttasks \\tor \\tplay \\tactivities\\n•\\t Does\\tnot \\tseem \\tto \\tlisten \\twhen \\tdirectly \\tspoken \\tto\\n•\\t Does\\tnot \\tfollow \\tthrough \\ton \\tinstructions \\tand \\tdoes \\tnot \\tfinish \\t\\nschoolwork,\\tchores, \\tor \\tduties \\tin \\tthe \\tworkplace\\n•\\t Has\\ttrouble \\torganizing \\ttasks \\tor \\tactivities\\n•\\t Avoids,\\tdislikes, \\tor \\tis \\treluctant \\tto \\tdo \\ttasks \\tthat \\tneed \\tsustained \\t\\nmental effort\\n•\\t Loses\\tthings \\tneeded \\tfor \\ttasks \\tor \\tactivities\\n•\\t Easily\\tdistracted\\n•\\t Forgetful\\tin \\tdaily \\tactivities\\nHYPERACTIVITY OR IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS\\n•\\t Fidgets\\twith \\tor \\ttaps \\thands \\tor \\tfeet, \\tor \\tsquirms \\tin \\tseat\\n•\\t Leaves\\tseat \\tin \\tsituations \\twhen \\tstaying \\tseated \\tis \\texpected\\n•\\t Runs\\tabout \\tor \\tclimbs \\twhen \\tnot \\tappropriate \\t(may \\tpresent \\tas \\t\\nfeelings of restlessness in adolescents or adults)\\n•\\t Unable\\tto \\tplay \\tor \\tundertake \\tleisure \\tactivities \\tquietly\\n•\\t “On\\tthe \\tgo,” \\tacting \\tas \\tif \\t“driven \\tby \\ta \\tmotor”\\n•\\t Talks\\texcessively\\n•\\t Blurts\\tout \\tanswers \\tbefore \\ta \\tquestion \\thas \\tbeen \\tfinished\\n•\\t Has\\tdifficulty \\twaiting \\this \\tor \\ther \\tturn\\n•\\t Interrupts\\tor \\tintrudes \\ton \\tothers\\nFrom Thapar A, Cooper M.

In the first half \\nof the 20th century, toilet mastery by 18 months of age was \\nthe norm in the United States. Brazelton’s introduction of \\nthe child-centered approach and the invention of disposable \\ndiapers facilitated later toilet training. Social changes, including \\nincreased maternal work outside of the home and group child \\nTreatment\\nManagement begins with recognizing ADHD as a chronic \\ncondition and educating affected children and their parents \\nabout the diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. With \\nappropriate management, including behavioral and academic \\ninterventions in conjunction with medication, up to 80% of \\nchildren have significant response to treatment. Anticipatory \\nguidance is important and includes providing proactive strategies \\nto mediate adverse effects on learning, school functioning, social \\nrelationships, family life, and self-esteem.\\nBehavioral therapy is central to children of all ages with \\nADHD and must be the core of overall treatment. Behavioral \\nmanagement includes establishment of structure, routine, \\nconsistency in adult responses to behaviors, and appropriate \\nbehavioral goals. Children also benefit when parents and clini-\\ncians work with teachers to address the child’s needs. Regular \\nbehavior report cards and other “check-in” aids may be helpful \\nto the child in their respective environments such as for a \\nclassroom and the overall school day.\\nThe pediatrician should advocate for optimal educational \\nsettings in the school. Children may qualify for individual \\neducation plans where school psychologists can establish orga-\\nnizational plans and charts for the individual child as part of a \\nmanagement plan. Social skills training or additional mental \\nhealth interventions may assist some children with behavior \\nchange or preservation of self-esteem, particularly when they \\nhave coexisting developmental or mental health conditions also \\nrequiring treatment.\\nStimulant medications (methylphenidate or amphetamine \\ncompounds) are the first-line agents for pharmacologic treat-\\nment of ADHD due to extensive evidence of efficacy and safety. \\nShort-term studies have shown a significant clinical benefit of \\nstimulant medications in reducing inattention, hyperactivity, \\nand impulsivity. Stimulant medications are available in short-\\nacting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting forms. Sustained \\nand long-acting forms are often preferred, yet there are no \\ndefinitive studies to establish the benefit of long-acting stimulants \\nover short-acting stimulant medication. Preparations include \\nliquid, chewables, tablets, capsules, and a transdermal patch, \\nallowing the clinician to tailor the choice of medication to the \\nchild’s needs. While stimulants have been shown to provide \\nsome benefit in short-term studies in preschool-aged children, \\nbehavioral management is still considered the standard of care \\nfor this age group.\\nNonstimulant medications, including atomoxetine \\n(norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitor), guanfacine, or clonidine \\n(α-agonists), may be helpful in children that do not respond \\nto stimulant medication, or for family preference, concerns \\nabout medication abuse or diversion, and contraindications \\nto stimulant use.\\nMedications continue to be developed as researchers add \\nto the knowledge of effectiveness and adverse side effects. \\nReputable resources such as the Centers for Disease Control and \\nPrevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) \\ncan provide up-to-date information on specific medications, \\ndosing, contraindications, and other considerations to optimize \\nmanagement for these children.\\nMedication side effects are common, occurring in about \\none third of patients and severe enough to indicate changing \\nor discontinuing the medication in 15% of patients.

Toilet training now usually begins after the second \\nbirthday and is achieved at about 3 years of age in middle-\\nclass white U.S. populations. Toilet training between 12 and \\n18 months of age continues to be accepted in lower-income  \\nfamilies.\\nPrerequisites for achieving elimination in the toilet include \\nthe child’s ability to recognize the urge for urination and defeca-\\ntion, to get to the toilet, to understand the sequence of tasks \\nrequired, to avoid oppositional behavior, and to take pride \\nin achievement. The entire process of toilet training can take \\n6 months and need not be hurried. Successful parent–child \\ninteraction around the goal of toilet mastery can set the stage \\nfor future active parental teaching and training (e.g., manners, \\nkindness, rules and laws, and limit setting).\\nENURESIS\\nEnuresis is urinary incontinence in a child who is adequately \\nmature to have achieved continence. Enuresis is classified as \\ndiurnal (daytime) or nocturnal (nighttime). In the United States, \\ndaytime and nighttime dryness are expected by 4 and 6 years \\nof age, respectively. Another useful classification of enuresis is \\nprimary (incontinence in a child who has never achieved \\ndryness) and secondary (incontinence in a child who has been \\ndry for at least 6 months).\\nEtiology\\nEnuresis is a symptom with multiple possible etiologic factors, \\nincluding developmental difference, organic illness, or psy-\\nchological distress. Primary enuresis often is associated with \\na family history of delayed acquisition of bladder control. A \\ngenetic etiology has been hypothesized, and familial groups \\nwith autosomal dominant phenotypic patterns for nocturnal \\nenuresis have been identified. Although most children with \\nenuresis do not have a psychiatric disorder, stressful life events \\ncan trigger loss of bladder control. Sleep physiology may \\nplay a role in the etiology of nocturnal enuresis, with a high \\narousal threshold commonly noted. In a subgroup of enuretic \\nchildren, nocturnal polyuria relates to a lack of a nocturnal \\nvasopressin peak. Another possible etiology is malfunction of \\nthe detrusor muscle with a tendency for involuntary contrac-\\ntions even when the bladder contains small amounts of urine. \\nReduced bladder capacity can be associated with enuresis and \\nis commonly seen in children who have chronic constipation \\nwith a large dilated distal colon, which impinges on the  \\nbladder.\\nEpidemiology\\nEnuresis is the most common urologic condition in children. \\nNocturnal enuresis has a reported prevalence of 15% in \\n5-year-olds, 7% in 8-year-olds, and 1% in 15-year-olds. The \\nspontaneous remission rate is reported to be 15% per year. \\nThe odds ratio of nocturnal enuresis in boys compared with \\ngirls is 1.4:1. The prevalence of daytime enuresis is lower than \\nnocturnal enuresis but has a female predominance, 1.5:1 at 7 \\nyears of age. Of children with enuresis, 22% wet during the \\nday only, 17% wet during the day and at night, and 61% wet at  \\nnight only.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nEnuresis\\nThe history focuses on elucidating the pattern of voiding \\nincluding frequency, timing (diurnal/nocturnal), associated \\nconditions or stressful events (e.g., bad dreams, consumption \\nof caffeinated beverages, or exhausting days), and whether it \\nis primary or secondary enuresis. A review of systems should \\ninclude a developmental history and detailed information \\nabout the neurologic, urinary, and gastrointestinal systems \\n(including patterns of defecation). A history of sleep patterns \\nis important, including snoring, parasomnias, and timing of \\nnighttime urination. A family history often reveals that one or \\nboth parents had enuresis as children. Although enuresis is rarely \\nassociated with child abuse, physical and sexual abuse history \\nshould be included as part of the psychosocial history. Many \\nfamilies have tried numerous interventions before seeking a \\nphysician’s help. Identifying these interventions and how they \\nwere carried out aids the understanding of the child’s condition \\nand its role within the family.\\nThe physical examination begins with observation of the \\nchild and the parent for clues about child developmental and \\nparent-child interaction patterns. Special attention is paid to \\nthe abdominal, neurologic, and genital examination. A rectal \\nexamination is recommended if the child has constipation. \\nObservation of voiding is recommended if a history of voiding \\nproblems, such as hesitancy or dribbling, is elicited. The lumbo-\\nsacral spine should be examined for signs of spinal dysraphism \\nor a tethered cord.\\nFor most children with enuresis, the only laboratory test \\nrecommended is a clean catch urinalysis to look for chronic \\nurinary tract infection (UTI), renal disease, and diabetes \\nmellitus. Further testing, such as a urine culture, is based on \\nthe urinalysis. Children with complicated enuresis, including \\nchildren with previous or current UTI, severe voiding dys-\\nfunction, or a neurologic finding, are evaluated with a renal \\nsonogram and a voiding cystourethrogram. If vesicoureteral \\nreflux, hydronephrosis, or posterior urethral valves are found, \\nthe child is referred to a urologist for further evaluation and  \\ntreatment.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThere is no commonly identified cause of enuresis and, in most \\ncases, enuresis resolves by adolescence without treatment. \\nChildren with primary nocturnal enuresis are most likely to \\nhave a family history and are least likely to have an identified \\netiology. Children with secondary diurnal and nocturnal enuresis \\nare more likely to have an organic etiology, such as UTI, diabetes \\nmellitus, or diabetes insipidus, to explain their symptoms. \\nChildren with primary diurnal and nocturnal enuresis may \\nhave a neurodevelopmental condition or a problem with bladder \\nfunction. Children with secondary nocturnal enuresis may have \\na psychosocial stressor or a sleep disturbance as a predisposing \\ncondition for enuresis.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Encopresis is the regular, voluntary, or involuntary \\npassage of feces into a place other than the toilet after 4 years \\nof age. Encopresis without constipation is uncommon and may \\nbe a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder or other psy-\\nchiatric illness. Soiling is the involuntary passage of stool and \\noften is associated with fecal impaction. The normal frequency \\nof bowel movements declines between birth and 4 years of age, \\nbeginning with greater than four stools per day to approximately \\none per day.\\nEtiology\\nThe etiology of functional constipation and soiling includes \\na low-fiber diet, slow gastrointestinal transit time for neuro-\\nlogic or genetic reasons, and chronic withholding of bowel \\nmovements, usually because of past painful defecation \\nexperiences. Approximately 95% of children referred to a \\nsubspecialist for encopresis have no other underlying pathologic  \\ncondition.\\nEpidemiology\\nIn U.S. studies, 16-37% of children experience constipation \\nbetween 5 and 12 years of age. Constipation with overflow \\nsoiling occurs in 1-2% of preschool children and 4% of school-\\naged children. The incidence of constipation and soiling is equal \\nin preschool girls and boys, whereas there is a male predomi-\\nnance during school age.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nTreatment\\nTreatment begins with treating any diagnosed underlying organic \\ncauses of enuresis. Elimination of underlying chronic constipa-\\ntion is often curative. For a child whose enuresis is not associated \\nwith an identifiable disorder, all therapies must be considered \\nin terms of cost in time, money, disruption to the family, the \\ntreatment’s known success rate, and the child’s likelihood to \\nrecover from the condition without treatment. The most com-\\nmonly used treatment options are conditioning therapy and \\npharmacotherapy. The clinician can also assist the family in \\nmaking a plan to help the child cope with this problem until \\nit is resolved. Many children have to live with enuresis for \\nmonths to years before a cure is achieved; a few children have \\nsymptoms into adulthood. A plan for handling wet garments \\nand linens in a nonhumiliating and hygienic manner preserves \\nthe child’s self-esteem. The child should take as much responsibil-\\nity as he or she is able, depending on age, development, and \\nfamily culture.\\nThe most widely used conditioning therapy for nocturnal \\nenuresis is the enuresis alarm. Enuresis alarms have an initial \\nsuccess rate of 30-60% with a significant relapse rate. The alarm \\nis worn on the wrist or clipped onto the pajama and has a \\nprobe that is placed in the underpants or pajamas in front of \\nthe urethra. The alarm sounds when the first drop of urine \\ncontacts the probe. The child is instructed to get up and finish \\nvoiding in the bathroom when the alarm sounds.\\nPharmacotherapy for nighttime enuresis includes desmopres-\\nsin acetate and, rarely, tricyclic antidepressants. Desmopressin \\ndecreases urine production and has proved to be safe in the \\ntreatment of enuresis. The oral medication is started at 0.2 m g \\nper dose (one dose at bedtime) and on subsequent nights is \\nincreased to 0.4 m g and then to 0.6  m g if needed. This treatment \\nmust be considered symptomatic, not curative, and has a relapse \\nrate of 90% when the medication is discontinued. Imipramine, \\nnow rarely used for enuresis, reduces the frequency of night -\\ntime wetting, and the initial success rate is 50%. Imipramine \\nis effective during treatment only, with a relapse rate of 90% \\non discontinuation of the medication. The most important \\ncontraindication is the risk of overdose (associated with fatal \\ncardiac arrhythmia).\\nComplications\\nThe psychological consequences can be severe. Families can \\nminimize the impact on the child’s self-esteem by avoiding \\npunitive approaches and ensuring that the child is competent \\nto handle issues of their own comfort, hygiene, and \\naesthetics.\\nPrevention\\nAppropriate anticipatory guidance to educate parents that \\nbed-wetting is common in early childhood helps alleviate \\nconsiderable anxiety.\\nFUNCTIONAL CONSTIPATION AND SOILING\\nConstipation is decreased frequency of bowel movements, \\nusually associated with a hard stool consistency.

The child should be praised for all com-\\nponents of cooperation with this program, and punishment \\nand embarrassment should be avoided. As symptoms resolve, \\ntoilet sitting is decreased to twice daily and finally to once  \\na day.\\nWhen disimpaction is achieved, the child begins the main-\\ntenance phase of treatment. This phase promotes regular stool \\nproduction and prevents reimpaction. It involves attention to \\ndiet, medications to promote stool regularity, and behavioral \\ntraining. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid are recommended. \\nFor children with chronic constipation, the recommended daily \\ndose of fiber is calculated as 10 grams plus the child’s age in \\nyears (e.g., a 10-year-old should take 20 g o f fiber per day). At \\nleast 2 ounces of nondairy fluid intake per gram of fiber intake \\nis recommended. Sorbitol-based juices, including prune, pear, \\nAbdominal x-ray is not required. It can be helpful to show to \\nthe family the degree of colonic distention and fecal impaction. \\nIn general, further studies, such as barium enema and rectal \\nbiopsy, are indicated only if an organic cause for the constipation \\nis indicated by history or physical examination (see Chapter \\n129). Similarly, although endocrinologic conditions such as \\nhypothyroidism can cause chronic constipation, laboratory \\nstudies are not indicated without history or physical examination \\nsuggesting such a disorder.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis for functional constipation and \\nsoiling includes organic causes of constipation (e.g., neurogenic, \\nanatomic, endocrinologic, gastrointestinal, and pharmaco-\\nlogic). A child with chronic constipation and soiling who had \\ndelayed passage of meconium and has an empty rectum and \\ntight sphincter may have Hirschsprung disease (see Chapter \\n129). Chronic constipation may be a presenting sign of \\nspinal cord abnormalities, such as a spinal cord tumor or a \\ntethered cord. Physical examination findings of altered lower \\nextremity reflexes, absent anal wink, or a sacral hairy tuft or \\nsacral sinus may be a clue to these anomalies. Hypothyroid-\\nism can present with chronic constipation and typically is \\naccompanied by poor linear growth and bradycardia. Anal \\nstenosis may lead to chronic constipation. The use of opiates, \\nphenothiazine, antidepressants, and anticholinergics also may \\nlead to chronic constipation. Developmental problems, including \\nmental retardation and autism, may be associated with chronic  \\nconstipation.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment begins with education and demystification for the \\nchild and family about chronic constipation and soiling, \\nemphasizing the chronic nature of this condition and the good \\nprognosis with optimal management. Explaining the physiologic \\nbasis of constipation and soiling to the child and the family \\nalleviates blame and enlists cooperation. Education may improve \\nadherence to the long-term treatment plan (Table 14.1). One \\nhalf to two thirds of children with functional constipation \\nrecover completely and no longer require medication. The \\nyounger the child is when diagnosis and treatment begin, the \\nhigher the success rate. Treatment involves a combination of \\nbehavioral training and laxative therapy. Successful treatment \\nrequires 6-24 months. The next step is adequate colonic cleanout \\nor disimpaction. Cleanout methods include enemas alone or \\ncombinations of enema, suppository, and oral laxatives. High-\\ndose oral mineral oil is a slower approach to cleanout. Choice \\nof disimpaction method depends on the age of the child, family \\nchoice, and the clinician’s experience with a particular method. \\nMethods and side effects are summarized in Table 14.2. The \\nchild and family should be included in the process of choosing \\nthe cleanout method. Because enemas may be invasive and \\noral medication may be unpleasant, allowing points of choice \\nand control for the child and praising all signs of cooperation \\nare important.\\nBehavioral training is essential to the treatment of chronic \\nconstipation and soiling. The child and family are asked to \\nmonitor and document stool output. Routine toilet sitting is \\ninstituted for 5-10 minutes, three to four times per day. The \\nchild is asked to demonstrate proper toilet sitting position \\nTABLE 14.1 Education About Chronic Constipation and \\nSoiling\\nConstipation affects 16-37% of children.\\nOne percent to 4% of children have functional constipation and \\nsoiling.\\nFunctional constipation with/without soiling begins early in life \\ndue to a combination of factors:\\nUncomfortable/painful stool passage\\nWithholding of stool to avoid discomfort\\nDiets higher in constipating foods and lower in fiber and fluid \\nintake*\\nUse of medications that are constipating\\nDevelopmental features—increasing autonomy; perhaps toilet \\navoidance\\nPossible family genetic factors—slower colonic transit\\nWhen chronic impaction, physiologic changes at the rectum \\nreduce a child’s bowel control.\\nDilated rectal vault results in reduced sensation to standard fecal \\nvolume.\\nRehabilitation of rectal musculature and strength requires several \\nmonths.\\nUntil then, dilated rectal musculature may be less able to \\nexpel\\tstool \\teffectively.\\nParadoxical\\tanal \\tsphincter \\tcontraction \\tmay \\toccur \\twhen \\tthe \\turge \\t\\nto defecate is felt; it can lead to incomplete emptying of stool at \\ndefecation attempt.\\nMany\\tchildren \\tdo \\tnot \\trecognize \\ttheir \\tsoiling \\taccidents \\towing \\tto \\t\\nolfactory accommodation.\\nLow self-esteem or other behavioral concerns are common on \\npresentation.\\nImprove for most with education and management for the \\nconstipation and soiling.\\nEffective management of functional constipation requires a \\nsubstantial commitment of the child/family, usually for 6–24 \\nmonths.\\nDegree\\tof \\tchild \\tand \\tfamily \\tadherence \\tis \\tlikely \\ta \\tpredictor \\tof \\tthe \\t\\nchild’s success.\\n*The common features of the transition to the toddler diet (decreased fluid \\nintake, continued high dairy intake, and finicky eating patterns) make this a \\nhigh-risk time during development for constipation problems.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Other sequelae include irritability, \\nbehavioral problems, learning difficulties, and motor vehicle \\naccidents in adolescents. Clear links between sleep disordered \\nbreathing and academic performance in the school-age child \\nhave been firmly established.\\nBehavioral sleep disorders are common and found across \\nall age groups but are most prevalent from infancy through \\npreschool age. Overall, behavioral insomnia of childhood \\nhas an estimated prevalence for 10-30%. Bedtime resistance \\noccurs in 10-15% of toddlers, while 15-30% of preschool-aged \\nchildren have difficulties achieving and/or maintaining sleep. \\nAlthough generally benign, parasomnias such as sleepwalking \\n(17% in children vs. 4% in adults) and sleep terrors (1-6%) occur \\ncommonly in young children. Sleepwalking peaks between 8 \\nand 12 years of age, has a familial association, and is more \\ncommon in males. Parasomnias typically resolve spontane-\\nously by adolescence, and OSA is reported in 1-5% of children. \\nCircadian rhythm disorders occur in 7-16% of adolescents.\\nClinical Manifestations and Evaluation\\nSlow-wave sleep is not seen before 3-6 months of age. Starting at \\n6-12 months and continuing through adulthood, the amount of \\nREM sleep shifts toward the last third of the night, while NREM \\nsleep predominates during the first third of the night. Infants are \\ncapable of sleeping through the night without feeds at around \\n6 months of age; this age varies with many factors including \\ngestational age, type of feeding (e.g., breast-fed infants tend \\nto awaken more frequently than formula-fed infants), familial \\nfactors, and general cultural contexts.\\nThe timing and duration of sleep also change with age. \\nSleep duration gradually decreases with age (0-12 years), \\nwhile longest sleep period increases (0-2 years); number of \\nnight awakenings decrease in the first 2 years of life; number \\nof daytime naps decreases (up to age 2). Sleep patterns also \\nbecome more diurnal. Full-term infants sleep on average 16-18 \\nhours per day in fragmented intervals throughout the day and \\nnight, and 1- to 3-year-old children sleep on average 10-16 \\nhours. Naps begin to decrease from two naps to one starting \\naround 15-18 months of age. The biological need for napping \\ndiminishes after age 2; significant consistent napping after age \\n2 has been associated with later sleep onset and reduced sleep \\nquality and duration. However, 50% of 3-year-olds still nap. \\nNapping in the older child and adolescent suggests insufficient \\nsleep or a sleep disorder.\\nADOLESCENT SLEEP\\nAdolescents also develop a physiologically based shift toward \\nlater sleep-onset and wake times relative to those in middle \\nchildhood. Most experts recommend that adolescents sleep at \\nleast 9 or 10 hours each night. However, only about 14-27% \\nof adolescents worldwide achieve this amount of sleep. The \\naverage amount of adolescent sleep is 7.5 hours per day; up to \\n25% of adolescents achieve only 6 hours of sleep a night. Insuf-\\nficient sleep in adolescents has been associated with morning \\ntiredness, day sleepiness, and negative effects on cognitive \\nfunction, moods, and motivation. Furthermore, sleep onset \\nlatency (the time it takes to fall sleep) in adolescents has been \\nassociated with fatigue, mood disorders, and anxiety. Early \\nschool start times have been associated with negative sleep \\nadolescent profiles. Overall, adolescents should be advised to \\nlimit or reduce screen time exposure prior to overall bedtime \\nto optimize sleep hygiene. Further studies on the use of electronic \\nmedia on adolescent bedtime, sleep latency, and duration are \\nwarranted to understand the actual impact and neurophysiologic \\nmechanisms of these associations. Similarly, the impact of \\nsubstances (tobacco, caffeine, alcohol) has shown variable effects \\non adolescent sleep profiles.\\nSLEEP DISORDERS\\nSleep problems are one of the most frequent complaints in \\npediatric practice. Numerous sleep disorders exist, including \\nbehavioral insomnias (bedtime refusal, delayed sleep onset, \\nnighttime awakenings), parasomnias, and circadian rhythm \\ndisorders (Table 15.1). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep \\ndisorders associated with mental and physical illness should \\nalso be considered.\\nEpidemiology\\nSleep problems occur in up to 50% of children at some point \\nduring childhood.

Some children present with daytime behavioral \\nproblems, including inattentiveness, hyperactivity, or irritability \\nrather than overt sleepiness. Screening for sleep disorders is \\nrecommended as part of primary care practice. Clinicians should \\ninquire about bedtime problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, \\nand awakenings during the night, regularity and duration of \\nsleep, and presence of snoring and sleep-disordered breathing.\\nThe assessment of sleep complaints begins with a detailed \\nhistory of sleep habits, including bedtime, sleep onset, and \\nwake times. A detailed description of the sleep environment \\ncan result in a dynamic understanding of the challenges to \\nand resources for achieving normal sleep. The recommended \\nhistory includes the type of bed, who shares it, the ambient \\nlight, noise, temperature, and the bedtime routine. Household \\nstructure, routines, and cultural practices may be important \\nand influence the timing and ease of sleep (e.g., parental work \\npatterns, evening activities, number of household members). \\nDietary practices influence sleep, including timing of meals and \\ncaffeine intake. A detailed history assessing for symptoms of \\nOSA (e.g., gasps, snorting noises, breathing pauses, etc.) should \\nbe obtained in all children who snore regularly. New-onset sleep \\ndisorders may be associated with a psychological trauma. When \\nthe history does not reveal the cause of the sleep disorder, a \\nsleep diary can be helpful. Specifically for pre-adolescents and \\nadolescents, a detailed history regarding bedtime routines, sleep \\nonset time, wake times, electronic media, and light products \\nin the room is valuable.\\nA complete physical examination is important to rule out \\nmedical causes of sleep disturbance such as conditions that \\ncause pain, neurologic conditions that could be associated with \\nseizure disorder, and other central nervous system disorders. \\nChildren with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and fetal \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A safe sleep environment is essential. It is important for \\nparents to understand that it is normal for their infant to wake \\nfrequently for the first 6 weeks before settling into a routine of \\nwaking every 3-4 hours for feeding. Infants typically do not \\nsleep through the night before 6 months of age, and some do \\nnot sleep through the night before 12-18 months of age. Even \\nthough co-sleeping (infant sleeping with parent) is common \\nand desired by many families for the purposes of convenience \\nand closeness, it is contraindicated due to the increased risk \\nof unexpected death.\\nBehavioral interventions comprise the mainstay of treatment \\nfor behavioral sleep disorders. In addition to meticulous atten-\\ntion to sleep hygiene and bedtime practices, difficulty falling \\nasleep and bedtime resistance in young children are treated by \\nspecific behavioral strategies. Systematic ignoring consists of \\nnot responding to a child’s demands for parental attention at \\nbedtime. Unmodified extinction (“cry it out”) involves putting \\nthe child to bed and then ignoring the child’s demands until the \\nnext morning. Graduated extinction involves waiting successively \\nlonger periods of time before briefly checking on the child. \\nBoth methods are effective in decreasing bedtime resistance \\nand enabling young children to fall asleep independently, but \\noutcomes are dependent on several variables. Positive reinforce-\\nment strategies can also be used in preschool-aged and older \\nchildren. These include rewards (e.g., stickers) for meeting a \\nbedtime goal (e.g., staying in bed). Rewards should be provided \\nimmediately (first thing in the morning) to increase effectiveness \\nand better link the reward with the positive behavior. Children \\nwith nighttime fears can benefit from behavioral therapy aimed \\nat reinforcing feelings of safety.\\nInfrequent or nonintrusive parasomnias do not need \\ntreatment beyond education and reassurance. Ensuring a safe \\nenvironment is essential. Sleep terrors are best managed by \\nminimal intervention because conversation with the child is \\nimpossible during the episode and attempts at calming are \\nunlikely to be successful. Anticipatory brief awakening of the \\nchild shortly before the typical occurrence of a parasomnia \\nmay be effective in aborting the event. Children with frequent \\nor prolonged parasomnias may need a sleep study to evaluate \\nfor possible coexisting sleep disorders or nocturnal seizures. \\nMedications that suppress slow-wave sleep may be indicated \\nin severe cases.\\nCircadian rhythm disorders are best treated by ensuring \\nsleep hygiene practices and gradual resetting of the biologic \\nclock. Bedtime fading involves allowing the child to go to bed \\nat the time he or she naturally feels tired and then gradually \\nadvancing the bedtime forward over the course of several weeks.\\nRarely, children with insomnia are treated pharmacologically. \\nMelatonin has soporific properties useful in treating delayed \\nsleep phase syndrome. It has been used successfully in both \\nchildren with normal development and those with developmental \\ndelays but should not be used unless after full evaluation and \\ngood medical surveillance. The α-agonist clonidine acts pref-\\nerentially on presynaptic α2 neurons to inhibit noradrenergic \\nactivity. Somnolence is a side effect of clonidine, which can \\nbe put to use in cases of refractory sleep difficulties; this is an \\noff-label use in children. There are data on treating children \\nas young as 4 years old with clonidine. Weaning off clonidine \\nis recommended at the end of treatment. Optimally, clonidine \\nshould be considered only under specialty care such as sleep \\nmedicine or neurology.\\nOSA in childhood is not always obvious or easy to diagnose. \\nOSA is commonly caused by tonsillar or adenoidal hypertrophy, \\nand obesity is a risk factor. A history of snoring is typical, and \\nsome children may present with excessive daytime sleepiness. \\nIn toddlers OSA often is associated with poor growth, which \\nimproves when the obstruction is relieved by a tonsillectomy \\nor adenoidectomy. Many children with OSA experience cog-\\nnitive difficulties and school problems; hyperactivity is also \\nmore common in children with OSA than in age-matched  \\ncontrols.\\nPrimary sleep disorders must be differentiated from sleep \\ndisorders associated with psychiatric and medical disorders. \\nPsychoses, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse can present \\nwith disordered sleep. The clinician should also consider sleep-\\nrelated epilepsy and developmental disorders.\\nPrevention and Treatment\\nEstablishing a baseline of healthy sleep habits is essential to \\nboth prevention and treatment of sleep disorders at all ages. \\nRecommendations include a consistent and appropriate bedtime \\nand bedtime routine, as well as close attention to sleep hygiene \\n(Table 15.2). A bedtime routine should last no more than 30 \\nminutes and consist of three or four soothing activities that \\nhelp calm the child and signal that it is time for sleep; activities \\nmay include bathing, brushing teeth, reading a story, or singing \\na song. Even older children and adolescents require a consistent \\npre-bed routine. A transitional object such as a blanket or stuffed \\nanimal can be used to promote positive sleep associations and \\nencourage self-soothing. The bedtime should be set early enough \\nto allow for sufficient nighttime sleep. Both bedtime and morning \\nwake time should be consistent, including on weekends. Televi-\\nsions and other electronic devices should be removed from \\nthe bedroom because they can lead to delayed sleep onset and \\nmaladaptive sleep associations.\\nSleep-onset association disorder in infancy usually can be \\nprevented by parental understanding of infant sleep physiology, \\ndevelopmentally appropriate expectations, and planning the \\ninfant sleep environment to coincide with family needs. It is \\nimportant to recognize and respect cultural and other familial \\ncontexts when providing guidance. It is recommended that \\ninfants be put in bed drowsy, but still awake, after they have had \\na diaper change, food, and comfort.

Buchanan\\nCHAPTER 16 \\nSomatic Symptom and Related \\nDisorders\\nSomatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs) make up a \\nnew category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \\nDisorders (DSM)-5 which replaces the somatoform disorders \\nfrom DSM-IV with the intent to eliminate diagnostic overlap \\nacross disorders. While DSM-IV emphasized medically unex-\\nplained symptoms, the current version allows for unexplained \\nsymptoms and those that may accompany diagnosed medical \\ndisorders. SSRDs involve physical symptoms (pain or loss of \\nfunction), may occur in the context of a physical illness, and \\nare identified by symptoms that go beyond the expected \\npathophysiology, affecting the child’s school, home life, and \\npeer relationships. SSRDs are often associated with psychosocial \\nstress that persists beyond the acute stressor, leading to the \\nbelief by the child and family that the correct medical diagnosis \\nhas not yet been found.\\nThe prevalence of SSRDs in children is not clearly known and \\nrepresents only a minority of outpatient visits in the pediatric \\npopulation. Adolescent girls tend to report nearly twice as many \\nfunctional somatic symptoms as adolescent boys, whereas prior \\nto puberty the ratio is equal. Affected children are more likely \\nto have difficulty expressing emotional distress, come from \\nfamilies with a history of marital conflict, child maltreatment \\n(including emotional, sexual, physical abuse), or history of \\nphysical illness. In early childhood, symptoms often include \\nrecurrent abdominal pain (RAP). Later, headaches, neurological \\nsymptoms, insomnia, and fatigue are more common.\\nExplainable medical conditions and an SSRD (e.g., seizures \\nand pseudoseizures) can coexist in up to 50% of patients and \\npresent difficult diagnostic dilemmas. The list of systemic \\nmedical disorders that could present with unexplained physical \\nsymptoms includes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple \\nsclerosis, myasthenia gravis, endocrine disorders, chronic \\nsystemic infections, vocal cord dysfunction, periodic paralysis, \\nacute intermittent porphyria, fibromyalgia, polymyositis, and \\nother myopathies.\\nDepression is a common comorbid condition and frequently \\nprecedes the somatic symptoms. Anxiety and panic also com-\\nmonly present with somatic complaints. Disorders included \\nin the SSRD group include somatic symptom disorder (SSD), \\nillness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder, factitious disorder, \\nand psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. \\nThe diagnostic criteria for SSRDs are established for adults and \\nneed additional study in pediatric populations.\\nSSD typically involves one or more somatic symptoms that \\nare distressing or result in significant disruption in daily life. The \\ncriteria used to diagnose this disorder are listed in Table 16.1. \\nIndividuals with SSD include the majority of those previously \\ndiagnosed with somatization disorder and hypochondriasis. \\nKey symptoms of the disorder are excessive thoughts, feelings, \\nor behaviors regarding the somatic complaint (e.g., excessive \\nfatigue or pain). Prevalence estimates for SSD in children are \\nunclear; however, between 5% and 7% of adults may be identified \\nwith SSD, with a greater proportion being female.\\nIllness Anxiety Disorder (Table 16.2) involves children who \\nhave a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. \\nTypically, somatic symptoms are not present, and there is a high \\nlevel of anxiety about health status. The child may be alarmed \\nby illness in others, and they seldom respond to reassurance \\nregarding their health. An elevated rate of medical utilization \\nis common, and individuals may repeatedly seek reassurance \\nfrom family, friends, and medical staff regarding their health. \\nApproximately 25% of those previously diagnosed with hypo-\\nchondriasis fall into this disorder and can be distinguished from \\nthose with SSD by their high anxiety and absence of somatic \\nsymptoms. Prevalence estimates in children are unknown due \\nto the new DSM classification system; however, there appears \\nto be similar prevalence rates in boys and girls.\\nConversion disorder involves symptoms affecting voluntary \\nmotor or sensory function and is suggestive of a neurological \\nillness in the absence of a disease process (Table 16.3). Adjust-\\nment difficulties, recent family stress, unresolved grief reactions, \\nand family psychopathology occur at a high frequency in \\nconversion symptoms. A physical condition and a conversion \\ndisorder (e.g., epileptic and nonepileptic seizures) may coexist \\nin the same patient. There are multiple subtypes of conversion \\ndisorder based upon the symptoms present including difficulties \\nwith primarily motor, sensory, neurological, or mixed symptoms.\\nPresenting symptoms follow the psychological stressor \\nby hours to weeks and may cause more distress for others \\nthan for the patient. This seeming lack of concern regarding \\npotentially serious symptoms is referred to as la belle indifference. \\nSymptoms are often self-limited but may be associated with \\nchronic sequelae, such as contractures or iatrogenic injury.\\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions \\nwere minimally changed in the current version of the DSM and \\nis marked by psychological or behavioral factors that adversely \\nimpact a medical condition by increasing the risk for suffering, \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Tricyclic \\nantidepressants (e.g., clomipramine) should be avoided in youth \\nwith functional abdominal pain (FAP), because it has little \\nproven efficacy in either pain management or mood disorders \\nand is very dangerous in overdose. In CFS with comorbid \\ndepression and anxiety, a more activating antidepressant, such \\nas bupropion, may be useful. Stimulants may also be helpful \\nin CFS.\\nTherapies such as cognitive-behavioral methods, which \\nreward health-promoting behaviors and discourage disability \\nand illness behaviors, have been shown to help in the treatment \\nof recurrent pain, CFS, fibromyalgia, and FAP . Additionally, \\nself-management strategies such as self-monitoring, relaxation, \\nhypnosis, and biofeedback provide some symptomatic relief and \\nencourage more active coping strategies. Family therapy and \\nfamily-based interventions may also be useful. Home school-\\ning should be avoided. School attendance and performance \\nshould be emphasized as important indicators of appropriate \\nfunctioning. In dealing with pain symptoms (e.g., headaches, \\nstomachaches), parents should limit attention/reinforcement for \\npain behavior, strongly encourage normal routines/appropriate \\nschedules (e.g., going to school), help the child identify stress \\nat home and school, provide attention and special activities on \\ndays when the child does not have symptoms, and limit activities \\nand interactions on sick days. Attempts to educate parents and \\npersonnel working with the child about limiting discussions \\nabout excessive discomfort or illness should occur. Caregivers \\nand the child should also be taught methods of controlling \\ntheir physiological and cognitive responses to discomfort via \\npracticing relaxation techniques and mindfulness techniques.\\nMalingering is considered a V-code in the DSM-5 and \\ninvolves the purposeful falsification or exaggeration of physical \\nand/or psychological symptoms for external gain (e.g., money, \\navoidance of school, work, jail). The key feature of malinger-\\ning is the seeking of an external reward. Symptoms may not \\nlessen when the reward is attained. Unless the patient is directly \\nobserved or confesses to such falsification, malingering is difficult \\nto prove.\\nCHAPTER 17 \\nAnxiety Disorders\\nAnxiety disorders are characterized by uneasiness, excessive \\nrumination, and apprehension about the future. The conditions \\ntend to be chronic, recurring, and vary in intensity over time. \\nThey affect 5-10% of children and adolescents (Table 17.1) and \\nhave a lifetime prevalence of approximately 30%. Some common \\nanxiety disorders are discussed in the following sections. \\nConditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and \\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are no longer included \\nin the DSM-5 section on anxiety but continue to share a close \\nrelationship with anxiety disorders.\\nPanic disorder is the presence of recurrent, unexpected \\npanic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden unexpected onset of \\nintense fear associated with a feeling of impending doom in \\nthe absence of real danger and may occur in the context of any \\nanxiety disorder.

Such a \\ncondition imposed on another commonly occurs following \\nhospitalization of the child or another family member. Many \\npatients demonstrate improvement when confronted with their \\nbehavior or acknowledge the factitious nature of their symptoms. \\nApproximate answers (e.g., the patient provides 13 as the answer \\nfor 20 − 3) reported during a mental status examination are \\nmost commonly found in factitious disorders. The prevalence \\nof factitious disorder in children is unknown. It is estimated \\nthat around 1% of individuals in hospital settings present with \\nsuch a condition.

The worries should \\nbe multiple, not paroxysmal, not focused on a single theme \\nand should cause significant impairment. The anxiety must \\nbe accompanied by at least one of the following symptoms: \\nrestlessness, fatigue, concentration difficulties, irritability, muscle \\ntension, or sleep disturbance. Physiological signs of anxiety are \\noften present, including shakiness, trembling, and myalgias. \\nGastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and \\nautonomic symptoms (tachycardia, shortness of breath) also \\ncommonly coexist. In children and adolescents, the specific \\nsymptoms of autonomic arousal are less prominent. Symptoms \\nare often related to school performance or sports. Patients also \\ncommonly present with concerns about punctuality and may be \\nperfectionistic. Children with GAD are often exceedingly self-\\nconscious, have low self-esteem, and have more sleep disturbance \\nthan patients with other kinds of anxiety disorder. Care must \\nbe taken to elicit internalizing symptoms of negative cognitions \\nabout the self (hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, suicidal \\nideation), as well as those concerning relationships (embar -\\nrassment, self-consciousness) and associated with anxieties. \\nInquiry about eating, weight, energy, and interests should also \\nbe performed to eliminate a mood disorder. GAD is slightly \\nmale predominant prior to puberty, but by adolescence, females \\noutnumber males.\\nUnspecified anxiety disorder  is a common condition in \\nclinical practice. This diagnosis is used when there is impairing \\nanxiety or phobic symptoms that do not meet full criteria for \\nanother anxiety disorder.\\npain, trembling/shaking, chills, paresthesias, fear of dying, fear \\nof losing control, derealization, dizziness, nausea, or shortness \\nof breath) during the attack. At least 1 month of persistent \\nworrying about having another panic attack and/or a significant \\nbehavioral change following an attack (e.g., attempting to avoid \\nanother attack, avoidance of triggers such as exercise) is required \\nto make the diagnosis.\\nPanic disorder often begins in adolescence or early adult -\\nhood. Symptom severity varies greatly. In children, the most \\ncommonly experienced symptoms include shortness of breath, \\npalpitations, chest pain, a choking sensation, and a fear of losing \\ncontrol or going “crazy. ” Symptoms may be brief or may last \\nfor prolonged periods of time; however, they generally last less \\nthan 15 minutes. Patients may believe that they are experiencing \\nan acute medical condition (e.g., a heart attack).\\nAgoraphobia is a disorder marked by anxiety or fear of \\nsituations where escape is difficult or would draw unwanted \\nattention to the person. This is limited to situations involving two \\nor more of five specific situations: fear/anxiety about the use of \\npublic transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed \\nspaces, standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside \\nof the home alone. Agoraphobia is often persistent and can \\nleave people homebound. While agoraphobia does commonly \\noccur with panic disorder, a substantial number of individuals \\nexperience agoraphobia without panic symptoms. First onset of \\nagoraphobia is rare in children but more commonly presents \\nin adolescence. Females are approximately twice as likely to \\nexperience the disorder. Agoraphobia is a chronic condition. In \\nchildren, being outside of the home alone and worries regarding \\nbecoming lost are common complaints.\\nTABLE 17.1 Common Anxiety Disorders: Characteristics\\nFEATURE PANIC DISORDER\\nGENERALIZED ANXIETY \\nDISORDER\\nSEPARATION ANXIETY \\nDISORDER SPECIFIC PHOBIA\\nEpidemiology Prevalence is 0.2-10%;\\nEight times more common \\nand of early onset in family \\nmembers of affected \\nindividuals than general \\npopulation.\\nPrevalence is 2-4%.

Several new diagnoses have \\nbeen included in each chapter to aid with diagnostic clarity \\nand assist in limiting overdiagnosis of some conditions, such \\nas bipolar disorder in children.\\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) requires a minimum of \\n2 weeks of symptoms including either depressed mood or loss \\nof interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. Four additional \\nsymptoms must also be present (Table 18.1). In children and \\nadolescents, a new onset of irritability and/or restlessness may be \\npresent instead of depressed mood. Furthermore, many children/\\nadolescents complain of pervasive boredom. A change in appetite \\n(usually decreased but can be increased) with carbohydrate \\ncraving, with or without accompanying weight changes, and \\nsleep disturbance along with somatic complaints (fatigue, \\nvague aches and pains) may also be present. Furthermore, a \\nkey indicator in children may be declining performance in \\nschool. Psychotic symptoms, seen in severe cases of MDD, are \\ngenerally mood-congruent (e.g., derogatory auditory hallucina-\\ntions, guilt associated delusional thinking). Suicidal thoughts \\nand attempts are common and should be evaluated. A prior \\nhistory of suicidal thoughts/attempts and prominent feelings of \\nhopelessness are risk factors that should be closely monitored.\\nPreviously a bereavement exclusion existed in making a \\ndiagnosis of MDD. Current evidence suggests that although \\nmost people experience bereavement following a significant loss \\n(e.g., loss of a loved one, financial ruin, etc.) without developing \\ndepression, many do, in fact, experience depressive symptoms \\nrelated to depression. As such, evidence suggests that treatments \\nfor MDD and MDD with bereavement are often likely to help \\nwith the remittance of symptoms.\\nThe prevalence of MDD in prepubertal children is approxi-\\nmately 2% with a 1 : 1  female-to-male ratio.

It is always \\nprudent to rule out mood disorder due to another medical \\ncondition or substance-related mood disorders before consider-\\ning MDD. Dysphoria and concentration concerns related to \\nuntreated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \\nmay also be mistakenly diagnosed as depression. Medically, \\nconditions such as hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes, and folate \\nand B12 vitamin deficiencies need to be ruled out.\\nPersistent depressive disorder (formerly dysthymia and \\nchronic MDD) (prevalence rate 0.5-2.0%) is a chronic form \\nof depression characterized by a depressed or irritable mood \\n(subjectively or described by others) present for at least 1 year. \\nTwo of the following symptoms are also required: changes in \\nappetite, sleep difficulty, fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentra-\\ntion or difficulty making decisions, and feelings of hopelessness. \\nApproximately 70% of children and adolescents with persistent \\ndepressive disorder eventually develop major depression.\\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) has been \\nadded to DSM-5 and includes children ages 6-18 years who \\npresent with a chronic (12 or more months) pattern of severe \\nirritability and behavioral dysregulation. The prevalence rate \\nof DMDD is not known; however, estimates based upon the \\ncore feature of chronic irritability suggest a rate between 2% \\nand 5%. DMDD typically first presents in school-age children \\nand is more common among males. In distinguishing bipolar \\ndisorder in children from DMDD, particular attention should \\nbe given to the course of symptoms (with DMDD being chronic \\nand persistent and bipolar disorder presenting with episodic \\nmood changes). Co-morbidities with DMDD are relatively \\nhigh, and conditions such as conduct, impulse-control, and \\ndisruptive behavior disorders should be assessed. Furthermore, \\nchildren and adolescents with DMDD may also present with \\nother mood concerns, anxiety, and/or autism spectrum disorder \\nsymptoms and diagnoses.\\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PDD)  was also added \\nto DSM-5 and is marked by repeated irritability, anxiety, and \\nmood lability that presents during the premenstrual cycle and \\nremits near the onset of menses. Approximately 1.8-5.8% of \\nadult women are thought to experience PDD with adolescent \\nrates thought to be at a similar level. At least five physical \\n(e.g., sleep disturbance, breast tenderness, joint/muscle pain, \\nfatigue, appetite changes) and/or behavioral symptoms (e.g., \\naffective lability, irritability, depressed mood, anxiety) must be \\npresent. Symptoms typically peak near the onset of menses. \\nPDD differs from premenstrual syndrome in the number of \\nsymptoms present and in regard to the affective symptoms \\nthat are present. MDD is the most commonly presenting co-\\nmorbidity. However, other conditions such as anxiety disorders, \\nallergies, migraine headaches, eating disorders, and substance \\nabuse disorders may worsen during the premenstrual period.\\nUnspecified depressive disorder is a diagnosis used when \\npatients have functionally impairing depressive symptoms that \\ndo not meet criteria for another condition.\\nNumerous specifiers for depressive disorders may also be \\nidentified. These include methods of noting additional struggles \\nwith anxious distress, mixed features (including elevated mood/\\nhypomanic symptoms), melancholic features (loss of pleasure/\\nlack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli), psychotic features, \\nand seasonal patterns (most common in northern or extreme \\nsouthern latitudes, in which depressive symptoms occur in \\nthe late fall and early winter when the hours of daylight are \\nshortening).\\nGenetic predisposition for MDD is present with twin studies \\nshowing 40-65% heritability. Additionally, family studies show \\na twofold to fourfold increased risk for depression in offspring \\nof depressed parents. Other potential responsible factors for \\ndepression include dysregulation of central serotonergic and/\\nor noradrenergic systems, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis \\ndysfunction, and the influence of pubertal sex hormones. Stress-\\nful life events such as abuse and neglect have also been found \\nto precipitate MDD, especially in young children.\\nAnxiety-related disorders (up to 80% prevalence), substance-\\nrelated disorders (up to 30% prevalence), and conduct/disruptive \\ndisorders (up to 20% prevalence) frequently present as co-morbid \\nwith MDD. Onset of MDD in childhood is also more likely \\nto be related to bipolar symptoms versus adult-onset bipolar \\ndisorder. This is especially true when a family history of bipolar \\ndisorder is present.\\nTABLE 18.1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \\nDisorders-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major \\nDepressive Disorder\\n A.

While the risk of suicide during an MDD episode is \\nhigh, it can be paradoxically higher during start of treatment, \\nas energy and motivation improve with cognitive recovery from \\ndepression.\\nTreatment is targeted toward decreasing morbidity and \\nsuicide. Along with treatments mentioned previously, modali-\\nties such as hospitalization, partial hospitalization, therapeutic \\nafter-school programs, or group therapies may be needed.\\nBIPOLAR AND RELATED DISORDERS\\nBipolar I disorder (BD) consists of distinct periods of mania \\n(elevated, expansive, or irritable moods and distractibility) and \\npersistent goal-directed activity or energy (Table 18.2) that may \\nalternate with periods of severe depression (Table 18.3).\\nTo diagnose mania associated with BD, euphoria (elevated \\nor expansive mood) with three additional symptoms or irritable \\nmood with four additional symptoms are required. Children \\nand adolescents with euphoric mood often present as bubbly, \\ngiggly, and “over-the-top” happy, to a degree that is socially \\nunacceptable to others. Grandiosity in children is often dramatic, \\nand they may believe they are superior to others in activities, \\nsports, or academics even when it is obvious that it is not true. \\nRacing thoughts and concentration difficulties are common in \\nBD and speech can be loud and pressured. Periods of extreme \\nrage may also present. Children with BD often present with \\nrapid shifts in mood or lability over brief time frames (e.g., \\nshifting between euphoria and dysphoria or irritability).\\nA decreased need for sleep without fatigue is a hallmark \\nof mania. There are no other diagnoses where a child has a \\ngreatly decreased amount of total sleep (compared with age-\\nappropriate norms) and is not fatigued. Sleep deprivation, \\nsubstance abuse, and antidepressants may trigger mania. BD \\nonset often begins with an episode of depression. Mania rarely \\noccurs prior to adolescence. It is estimated that 33% of youth \\nwill develop BD within 5 years of a depressive episode and 20% \\nof all patients with BD will experience their first manic episode \\nduring adolescence. Hypomania is used to describe a period \\nof more than 4 but fewer than 7 days of manic symptoms. It \\nalso is used, less specifically, to describe less intense mania. The \\nprevalence of psychosis in adolescents with BD (most often \\nauditory hallucinations) is 16-60%. Although high, it is still \\nless than its prevalence in adult BD.\\nBipolar II disorder includes at least one current or past full \\nmajor depressive episode and at least one period of current or \\npast hypomania. Unspecified bipolar and related disorder is \\nused to describe prominent symptoms of BD that do not meet \\nfull diagnostic criteria or when historical information is unclear \\nor insufficient to make a specific diagnosis.\\nCyclothymic disorder is a chronic (greater than 1 year) \\nmood disorder characterized by several periods of hypomanic \\nsymptoms and depressive symptoms (which do not have to \\nmeet the full diagnostic criteria for hypomania or a depres-\\nsive episode, respectively). The lifetime prevalence rate for \\ncyclothymic disorder is around 1%. Childhood rates are not \\nclearly established. The male to female ratio for the disorder is \\nfairly equal, and in children, the mean age of onset is 6.5 years. \\nADHD has a strong co-morbidity with cyclothymic disorder \\nTreatment of depression involves psychopharmacological \\napproaches and/or psychotherapy. Regardless of the treatment \\napproach chosen, a thorough diagnostic interview and screening \\nmeasures should be completed. There are a variety of screening \\ntools such as Kovacs Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) \\nthat may be helpful. First-line pharmacological treatment \\ninvolves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that have \\ndemonstrated response rates of 50-70% despite high-placebo \\nresponse rates. Fluoxetine is the only medication approved by \\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment \\nin youth 8 years and older. However, many other “off label” \\nmedications such as citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, \\nand venlafaxine have positive clinical trial results as well. An \\nantidepressant should be given an adequate trial (6 weeks at \\ntherapeutic doses) before switching or discontinuing unless \\nthere are serious side effects. For a first episode of depression \\nin children and adolescents, treatment for 6-9 months after \\nremission of symptoms is recommended. Patients with recurrent \\nor persistent depression may need to take antidepressants for \\nextended periods (years or even a lifetime). If a patient does \\nnot respond to adequate trials of two or more antidepressants, \\na child psychiatrist should be consulted. Following a thorough \\nevaluation, the psychiatrist may use augmentation strategies that \\ninclude other medications such as lithium, thyroid hormone, \\nlamotrigine, or bupropion.\\nFor acute depression, more frequent office visits are indicated, \\nand the risks of medication (including suicidal and self-destructive \\nbehaviors) should always be discussed with caregivers and the \\npatient. Higher frequency of monitoring should include regular \\ntelephone calls and/or collaborative care with a psychotherapist. \\nPsychoeducation about the illness and a discussion about calling \\nimmediately if new symptoms occur should be held with the \\nfamily. Notable side effects are thoughts of suicide, increased \\nagitation, or restlessness. Other side effects include headache, \\ndizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep cycle disturbance, \\nsexual dysfunction, akathisia, serotonin syndrome, and risk of \\nincreased bruising (due to platelet inhibition).\\nIn 2004, the FDA issued warnings regarding the potential \\nfor increased suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors when using \\nan antidepressant. The data suggest that antidepressants pose \\na 4% risk, versus a 2% risk in placebo. An increase in suicides \\nin children and adolescents since that year has many experts \\nbelieving that it might be related to lowered prescription rates \\nof antidepressants and resultant untreated depression. Substance \\nuse, concomitant conduct problems, and impulsivity increase \\nthe risk of suicide.\\nPsychotherapy appears to have good efficacy in mild to \\nmoderate depression. In moderate to severe depression, com-\\nbined treatment with psychotherapy and medication has the \\ngreatest rate of response, although in severe cases, the efficacy \\nwas equivalent to medication alone. Cognitive-behavioral \\ntherapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapies have received the \\nmost empirical support. CBT involves a variety of behavioral \\ntechniques and skills-building to mitigate cognitive distortions \\nand maladaptive processing. Interpersonal therapy focuses on \\ncollaborative decisions between the therapist and patient and \\nis based on the exploration and recognition of precipitants of \\ndepression. Family therapy is often used as an adjunct to other \\ntreatments for depression. Light therapy has been shown to \\nbe beneficial for seasonal variants of MDD. Electroconvulsive \\ntherapy (ECT) is also used in refractory and life-threatening \\ndepression.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

These include methods of noting additional struggles \\nwith anxious distress, mixed features (including elevated mood/\\nhypomanic symptoms), melancholic features (loss of pleasure/\\nlack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli), psychotic features, \\nseasonal patterns, and rapid cycling (four or more mood episodes \\nduring a 12-month period).\\nIt is estimated that 1% of children and adolescents meet \\ndiagnostic criteria for BD. According to retrospective studies, \\n60% of BD onset occurs before 20 years of age, although it is \\noften not until adulthood that BD is diagnosed. Although BD in \\nadults tends to be gender neutral, it is estimated that prepubertal \\nBD is almost four times more frequently diagnosed in boys.\\nTABLE 18.2 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \\nDisorders-5 Diagnostic Criteria for a Manic \\nEpisode\\n A.

It \\nmay be necessary to evaluate a patient in a substance-free state \\nto make an accurate diagnosis of BD. Many patients with BD \\nmay meet criteria for CD due to aggression and impulsivity. \\nIn distinguishing BD from CD, patients with BD generally \\nexhibit reactive aggression, whereas those with CD are more \\nlikely to preplan crimes.\\nNo laboratory or imaging studies can diagnose BD. Physical \\nexamination, careful history, review of systems, and labora -\\ntory testing are done to rule out suspected medical etiologies, \\nincluding neurological and substance-related disorders.\\nTreatment of BD initially includes targeting acute symptoms. \\nIf suicidal ideation and/or risk taking behaviors are present, \\nhospitalization may be necessary. Treatment typically involves a \\nvariety of approaches depending upon the developmental level \\nof the child/adolescent. Multiple FDA-approved medications \\nincluding lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, olanzap-\\nine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole are \\navailable for adults with BD. Lithium is the oldest proven treat-\\nment for mania in adults and has been used in acute episodes \\nand as a maintenance treatment in children and adolescents. \\nCommon side effects of lithium include hypothyroidism, \\npolyuria, and acne. Anticonvulsants are also a first-line agent \\n(preferable for mixed or rapid cycling cases) for adults. They have \\nalso been used effectively in youth, but are not FDA-approved \\nin children for BD. Periodic monitoring of blood levels for \\nselect medications (lithium and divalproex sodium) can help \\nensure both treatment safety and the receipt of therapeutic \\namounts of the medication. Neuroleptics (e.g., risperidone, \\nolanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone) have \\nhad positive results in youth with BD. The increased risk of \\ntardive dyskinesia should be considered in using such agents. \\nBenzodiazepines may also be helpful for alleviating insomnia \\nand agitation during acute mania.\\nTreating co-morbid psychiatric disorders must be done care-\\nfully. Stimulants may be used to treat ADHD once the patient has \\nbeen stabilized on a mood stabilizer. In contrast, antidepressants \\nshould be avoided; if the youth is depressed or has significant \\nanxiety and is not responsive to other pharmacotherapy, cautious \\nuse of antidepressants may be necessary. Careful monitoring \\nfor manic reactivation, cycling, and suicidality is needed.\\nCognitive and behavioral therapies are aimed at initially \\nimproving adherence to medication treatments and ameliorating \\nanxiety and depressive symptoms. Psychoeducation and family \\ntherapy may also be needed to stabilize the patient’s environ-\\nment and improve prognosis. There should be ongoing safety \\nassessment. Additionally, patients may display struggles with \\ncoping skills, impaired social/interpersonal relationships, and \\ndevelopmental deficits due to poor learning while symptomatic; \\ntherefore additional skills training and collaboration with the \\nchild’s school regarding behavior management, special education \\nneeds, and an appropriate individualized education plan may \\nalso be needed.\\nWhen compared with depression, the rates of suicide \\nand suicidal ideation are even higher in BD. Forty percent \\nof children and 50% of adolescents with BD attempt suicide \\nwith approximately 10-15% completing attempts. High levels of \\nirritability, impulsivity, and poor ability to consider consequences \\n(e.g., substance abuse) increase the risk of completed suicide. \\nAttempters are usually older, more likely to have mixed episodes \\nand psychotic features, co-morbid substance use, panic disorder, \\nnonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, a family history of suicide \\nattempts, history of hospitalizations, and history of physical or \\nsexual abuse. Legal problems in adolescence is also a strong \\npredictor of suicide attempts, with approximately one fourth of \\nthose attempting suicide having experienced legal concerns in \\nthe preceding 12 months. Ensuring safety should always be the \\nfirst goal of treatment. Hospitalization, partial hospitalization, \\nintensive outpatient treatment, and intensive in-home services \\nare used as needed for stabilization and safety.\\nCHAPTER 19 \\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by \\nobsessions, compulsions, or both in the absence of another \\npsychiatric disorder that better explains the symptoms (Table \\n19.1). Obsessions are recurring intrusive thoughts, images, or \\nimpulses. Compulsions are repetitive, nongratifying behaviors \\nthat a person feels driven to perform in order to reduce or \\nprevent distress or anxiety. In children, rituals or compulsive \\nsymptoms may predominate over worries or obsessions, and \\nthe child may attempt to ignore or neutralize an obsessive \\nthought by performing compulsions. Symptoms may or may \\nnot be recognized as being excessive or unreasonable. Some \\nof the most common examples of obsessions in children are \\nfears of contamination, fears of dirt/germs, repeated doubts, a \\nneed for orderliness or precision, and aggressive thoughts. \\nCommon compulsions include grooming rituals (e.g., handwash-\\ning, showering, teeth brushing), ordering, checking, requesting \\nor demanding reassurance, praying, counting, repeating words \\nsilently, and touching rituals.\\nPrevalence of OCD in children and adolescents ranges from \\n1% to 4%, increasing with age. Boys typically have an earlier age \\nof onset with approximately one quarter of boys being diagnosed \\nprior to 10 years of age. It is most commonly diagnosed between \\nthe ages of 7 and 12 years. Symptoms typically have a gradual \\nonset. Twin studies suggest that obsessive-compulsive symptoms \\nare moderately heritable, with genetic factors accounting for \\n45-65% of variance.\\nUp to 50% of youth with OCD have at least one other \\npsychiatric illness. Some of the most common psychiatric co-\\nmorbidities include mood and anxiety disorders (up to 75%), \\nbehavioral disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \\n[ADHD] and oppositional defiant disorder) (up to 50%), tic \\ndisorders (20-30%), hoarding disorder, developmental disorders, \\nbody dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, and obsessive-\\ncompulsive personality disorder (OCPD).\\nStreptococcal infection causing inflammation in the basal \\nganglia may account for 10% of childhood-onset OCD and \\nis a part of a condition historically referred to as pediatric \\nautoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococ-\\ncal (PANDAS) infection. PANDAS is a subtype of pediatric \\nacute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS), which can, in \\npart, be distinguished by an abrupt onset of moderate to severe \\nOCD symptoms. Antistreptolysin O, antistreptococcal DNAase \\nB titers, and a throat culture assist in diagnosing a group A \\nbeta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Early antibiotic therapy \\nmay help treat these cases.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Overactivity in neural path-\\nways involving orbital frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus \\nhas been implicated in OCD.\\nPhysical examination may reveal rough, cracked skin as \\nevidence of excessive handwashing. Other common complaints \\nmight include a persistent fear of illness, expressed concerns \\nregarding the health of family members, and fear that something \\nbad will happen to someone.\\nThe Y ale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is \\nregarded as the gold standard measure of obsessive-compulsive \\nsymptom severity. Although somewhat lengthy, it can be helpful \\nin the clinical setting. Additionally, there are numerous other \\ndiagnostic questionnaires available to assist in making an \\naccurate diagnosis.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involving exposure and \\nresponse prevention is considered the treatment of choice in \\nmild to moderate cases. CBT provides durability of symptom \\nrelief and avoidance of potential pharmacotherapy-associated \\nside effects. As with anxiety disorders, CBT is at least as good, \\nif not better, than medications. The combination of medications \\nand CBT has shown the best response. CBT typically involves \\ngradually exposing the child to their fear/obsession paired with \\nstrategies that target preventing the child from performing the \\nunwanted ritual/compulsion. Over time with repeated exposure \\nand response prevention, the urge to repeat the compulsion(s) \\ndissipates.\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recom -\\nmended for higher severity of symptoms and complications \\nwith co-morbidities or when cognitive or emotional ability \\nare insufficient to demonstrate success in CBT. Additionally, if \\nquality CBT is not available, treatment with medications alone \\nwhile psychotherapy referral is pursued is a reasonable choice.\\nSSRI (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, \\ncitalopram, and escitalopram) treatment is generally thought to \\nshow a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio in OCD. Side effects such as \\nactivation, akathisia, disinhibition, impulsivity, and hyperactivity \\nmay be seen. Monitoring of height may be advisable due to \\npossible growth suppression associated with the SSRIs.\\nCommon protocols suggest three trials of an SSRI and, if \\nunsuccessful, clomipramine can be tried next. Careful monitor-\\ning of potential anticholinergic side effects, lowering of blood \\npressure, and EKG monitoring is necessary. Combination therapy \\nusing an SSRI with an antipsychotic medication (risperidone or \\nanother atypical antipsychotic) may also be considered, especially \\nwith specific co-morbidities (e.g., tic disorders). Antipsychotics \\nare also useful when the intrusive thoughts associated with \\nOCD become nearly delusional in nature. Psychostimulants \\nmay be used with co-morbid ADHD, even though there is a \\nrisk that they may increase obsessional symptoms and tics. \\nChildren should be closely monitored for suicidal thoughts, \\nas such ideation is not uncommon, increasing with symptom \\nseverity and depressive co-morbidities.\\nMost responders exhibit partial response only, and as many as \\none third of young people with OCD are refractory to treatment. \\nPoor prognostic factors include co-morbid psychiatric illness \\nand a poor initial treatment response.\\nDeep brain stimulation of the basal ganglia, through surgi-\\ncally implanted electrodes and surgical interventions (anterior \\ncapsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and \\nlimbic leucotomy), are reserved for very severe cases or highly \\nrefractory cases.\\nTABLE 19.1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \\nDisorders-5 Criteria for Diagnosis of \\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\n A.

A diagnosis of social \\n(pragmatic) communication disorder (SCD) may be made in \\nthe absence of RRPBs.\\nOnset of ASD is in infancy and preschool years. Hallmarks \\nof ASD include impaired communication and impaired social \\ninteraction as well as stereotypical behaviors, interests, and \\nactivities.

Recent research \\nreveals major gains, but not a cure, with early diagnosis and \\ntreatment.\\nSCD involves difficulties with the social use of verbal and \\nnonverbal communication. SCD involves struggles with using \\ncommunication for social purposes (e.g., greeting others, sharing \\ninformation, conversational rules, inferences, and pragmatic \\nskills). SCD is marked by many of the same communication \\ndeficits seen in children with ASD with the absence of RRPBs. \\nSCD is believed to be rare in children prior to 4 years of age; \\nhowever, the prevalence rate is unclear because of its recent \\naddition to the DSM-5. Typically, speech and language therapy \\nand social skills training are employed to treat SCD.\\nTreatment of ASD is typically multimodal. At present, there \\nare no pharmacological treatments for the core symptoms of \\nASDs. Antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, \\naripiprazole, ziprasidone, paliperidone, haloperidol, thioridazine) \\nare used for aggression, agitation, irritability, hyperactivity, and \\nself-injurious behavior. Anticonvulsants have also been used for \\naggression. Naltrexone has been used to decrease self-injurious \\nbehavior, presumably by blocking endogenous opioids. Selective \\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors are given for anxiety, perseveration, \\ncompulsions, depression, and social isolation. Stimulants are \\nuseful for hyperactivity and inattention; however, there are \\nreports of significant worsening of irritability and aggression \\nin some patients treated with stimulants. Alpha-2 agonists \\n(guanfacine, clonidine) are used for hyperactivity, aggression, \\nand sleep dysregulation, although melatonin is first-line medica-\\ntion for sleep dysregulation.\\nA variety of nonpharmacological interventions exist for ASD. \\nSuch interventions have largely fallen under the classification of \\nbehavioral training. Models have typically employed therapies \\nindividually tailored for children with ASD and their families/\\ncaregivers. Evidence suggests that useful therapies have included \\ntechniques from applied behavior analysis (ABA), discrete trial \\ntraining (DTT), functional behavioral analysis (FBA), and \\nstructured teaching (TEACCH Model). Behavioral management \\ntraining for parents has also demonstrated efficacy in helping \\nwith unwanted behaviors. Special education services should be \\nindividualized for the child. Occupational, speech, and physical \\ntherapy are often required. Referral for disability services and \\nsupport is often warranted. Family support groups and individual \\nsupportive counseling for parents is useful. The prognosis for \\nASD is guarded and varies greatly from child to child. There \\nare no known methods of primary prevention. Treatment and \\neducational interventions are aimed at decreasing morbidity \\nand maximizing function.\\nSCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM AND OTHER \\nPSYCHOTIC DISORDERS\\nSchizophrenia generally presents in adolescence or early adult-\\nhood. The same diagnostic criteria are applied as in adults but \\nmust be interpreted in terms of the developmental stage of the \\nchild (Table 20.2). Several significant changes to the diagnosis \\nof schizophrenia were made within the DSM-5. The most \\nsignificant changes involve requiring two or more of the core \\nfeatures of a psychotic disorder (delusion, hallucinations, \\ndisorganized speech, disorganized/catatonic behavior, negative \\nsymptoms) to be present, with at least one of the first three \\n“positive symptoms” also being present. Additionally, subtypes \\nof schizophrenia (e.g., paranoid, catatonic, undifferentiated) \\nunderstand nonverbal communication (e.g., eye contact, facial \\nexpressions) and do not interact with people as significantly dif-\\nferent from objects. Communication and speech often are delayed \\nand, when present, may be marked by echolalia (repetition of \\nlanguage of others), perseveration (prolonged repetition of words \\nor behaviors of others), pronoun reversal, nonsense rhyming, \\nand other abnormalities. Intense absorbing interests, ritualistic \\nbehavior, and compulsive routines are characteristic, and their \\ndisruption may invoke behavioral dysregulation. Self-injurious \\nbehaviors (head banging, biting), repetitive motor mannerisms \\n(rocking, lining up objects, simple motor stereotypies), and \\nhyperreactivity/hyporeactivity to their environment (diminished \\nresponse to pain, adverse reactions to sounds/textures, or unusual \\nvisual inspection of objects) may be noted.\\nAlthough the full etiology of ASD is unknown, it is largely \\nconsidered a genetic disorder. There is an increased risk of ASD \\nin siblings compared to the general population. Twin studies \\nhave revealed high levels of concordance (36-95%) for identical \\ntwins. Family studies reveal prevalence rates of between 2% and \\n18% in siblings, and when absent, there may be increased risk \\nfor other language, learning, and social development problems.\\nIt has been proposed that brain connectivity is adversely \\naffected. Abnormalities in the limbic system, temporal, and \\nfrontal lobes have been suggested. Some postmortem studies \\nreveal abnormalities in the brain microarchitecture, size, and \\nneuronal packing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging \\n(fMRI) studies show that hypoactivity of the fusiform gyrus \\nof the amygdala, a location involved in face processing tasks \\nand facial expression recognition involved in social and affective \\njudgments, may be impacted in ASD.\\nThere are no definitive laboratory studies for ASD, but they \\ncan help rule out other diagnoses. A hearing test (may account \\nfor the language deficits), chromosomal testing (to identify \\nfragile X syndrome, tubular sclerosis, and genetic polymor-\\nphisms), congenital viral infections, and metabolic disorders \\n(phenylketonuria) should be performed. Electroencephalography \\nabnormalities may be seen in 20-25% of children with ASD, \\nbut they are not diagnostic.\\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends \\nscreening for autism at 18 and 24 months of age. There are \\nnumerous screening measures that may be employed (e.g., \\nChildhood Autism Rating Scale [CARS], Modified Checklist \\nfor Autism in Toddlers [M-CHAT], Gilliam Autism Rating \\nScale [GARS], and Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and \\nY oung Children [STAT]) to assist with appropriate referral for \\ndiagnostic evaluation. “Gold standard” psychological measures \\nsuch as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) \\nand Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) are commonly recom-\\nmended to confirm a diagnosis. Other measures of language, \\nadaptive skills, and intelligence may also be administered if ASD \\nis suspected. Psychological tests in children with ASD often show \\nstrengths in nonverbal tasks (e.g., puzzles) and marked deficiency \\nin verbal cognitive abilities. Speech pathology consultation can \\nbe helpful in evaluating the communication difficulties.\\nCommon psychiatric co-morbidities include intellectual \\ndisability, language/communication disorders, anxiety disor -\\nders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental \\ncoordination disorder, and depressive disorders. Other medical \\ncomplexities commonly seen in children with ASD include \\nseizure disorder, sleep disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders \\n(constipation, food selectivity). Intellectual abilities and language \\nabilities are the strongest predictors of improved long-term \\nprognosis.

If symptoms are present for more than 1 \\nmonth but less than 6 months, a diagnosis of schizophreniform \\ndisorder is made. Psychotic symptoms that do not meet full \\ndiagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but are clinically significant \\nare diagnosed as an unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or \\nother psychotic disorder. Other disorders in the differential \\ndiagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder are ASD, \\nneurocognitive disorders, substance-induced psychosis, bipolar \\ndisorders, and organic brain disorders.\\nThere are several disorders that also fall within the spectrum \\nof schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders that should be \\ndistinguished from schizophrenia. These include the following:\\nSchizoaffective disorder is diagnosed when a person has \\nclear symptoms of schizophrenia lasting at least 2 weeks and \\nexperiences a major mood episode (major depression/mania) \\nduring an uninterrupted period of the illness. These affective \\nsyndromes occur at other times, even when psychotic symptoms \\nare present. This condition is very rare in children and has \\na lifetime prevalence that is much lower than schizophrenia \\n(0.3% lifetime prevalence).\\nPsychotic disorder due to another medical condition  \\ndescribes psychotic symptoms that are judged to be the direct \\nresult of a general medical condition. There are a variety of \\npotential underlying medical etiologies. Some of the most \\ncommon precipitating illnesses in children are epilepsy, \\nmetabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders.\\nSubstance/medication-induced psychotic disorders have \\npsychotic symptoms related to substance intoxication/withdrawal \\nor following exposure to a medication. While prevalence is not \\nclearly known, estimates suggest that between 7% and 25% of \\nfirst episodes of psychoses are related to substances.\\nNo diagnostic tests or imaging studies are specific for \\nschizophrenia. It is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. Obtaining \\na family history with attention to mental illness is critical. The \\nidentification of schizophrenia should include a physical and \\nneurological examination, MRI, electroencephalography (to rule \\nout epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy), substance/drug \\nscreening, and metabolic screening for endocrinopathies. Evalu-\\nation to rule out Wilson disease and delirium is also indicated. \\nPsychotic symptoms in younger children must be differentiated \\nfrom manifestations of normal vivid fantasy life or abuse-related \\nsymptoms. Y outh with post-traumatic stress disorder often \\nhave vivid recollections and nightmares related to abuse but, \\nsometimes, are less specific and can include nightmares with \\nother negative topics. Psychological testing can be helpful in \\nidentifying psychotic thought processes.\\nTreatment is based on a multimodal approach, including \\nthe use of antipsychotic medications. First-line drugs are \\natypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, \\naripiprazole, ziprasidone, and paliperidone). Second-line medica-\\ntions are typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, thiothixene, \\nchlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, loxapine, and molindone). It \\nhave been discarded, and severity ratings for the core symptoms \\nhave been included to reflect a more dimensional approach to \\nthe spectrum of schizophrenia.\\nChildhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare disorder ( <1 in \\n10,000 children) and usually indicates a more severe form of \\nschizophrenia. The frequency increases between 13 and 18 \\nyears of age, typically with the initial presentation of psychotic \\nfeatures. The incidence in boys is slightly greater than in girls, \\nand the age of onset tends to be later for girls. The etiology \\nof schizophrenia is not clearly known, but numerous studies \\nhave demonstrated a substantial genetic predisposition for the \\ndisorder. In addition, family studies consistently show a higher \\nrisk in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins and \\nsiblings. First-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia \\nhave a 10-fold higher risk.\\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia typically fall into four broad \\ncategories:\\n•\\t Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. \\nHallucinations are auditory or visual misperceptions that \\noccur without external stimuli. Delusions are fixed false \\nbeliefs and can be bizarre or non-bizarre depending on \\ncultural norms.\\n•\\t Negative symptoms include a lack of motivation and social \\ninteractions and flat affect. Negative symptoms are most \\nfrequent in early childhood and later adolescence.

Downes\\nCHAPTER 21 \\nFailure to Thrive\\nFailure to thrive (FTT) is a descriptive term given to infants and \\nyoung children with malnourishment resulting in inadequate \\ngrowth. To date, there are no universally accepted anthropo -\\nmetric criteria for FTT as different anthropometric indicators \\nand cut points have been used. Commonly used criteria include \\nweight below the 3rd or 5th percentile for age; weight decreasing, \\ncrossing two major percentile lines on the growth chart over \\ntime; or weight less than 80% of the median weight for the \\nheight of the child. Caveats to these definitions exist. According \\nto growth chart standards, 3% of the population naturally falls \\nbelow the 3rd percentile. These children, who typically have \\nshort stature or constitutional delay of growth, usually are \\nproportional (normal weight for height). Additionally, in the \\nfirst few years of life, large fluctuations in percentile position \\ncan occur in normal children. Changes in weight should be \\nassessed in relation to height (length) and head circumference.\\nDespite these limitations in defining FTT, anthropometric \\ndata and growth charts provide important information. Of note, \\nallowances must be made for prematurity; weight corrections \\nare needed until 24 months of age, height corrections until 40 \\nmonths of age, and head circumference corrections until 18 \\nmonths of age. Also of note, there are specific growth charts \\nfor genetic conditions such as Down syndrome and Turner \\nsyndrome that should be used when assessing growth for \\nchildren with these conditions. Although some growth variants \\ncan be difficult to distinguish from FTT, growth velocity and \\nheight-for-weight determinations can be useful in distinguishing \\nthe cause. In children with FTT, malnutrition initially results \\nin wasting (deficiency in weight gain). Stunting (deficiency in \\nlinear growth) generally occurs after months of malnutrition, \\nand head circumference is spared except with chronic, severe \\nmalnutrition. FTT that is symmetric (proportional weight, \\nheight/length, and head circumference) suggests long-standing \\nmalnutrition, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infection, \\nor teratogenic exposures. Short stature with preserved weight \\nsuggests an endocrine etiology.\\nETIOLOGY\\nThere are multiple possible causes of growth failure (Table 21.1). \\nIn the past, etiologies of FTT were sometimes categorized  \\nas organic (underlying medical condition diagnosed) and \\nnonorganic (no underlying medical cause). This dichotomous \\nclassification can be problematic because, in many cases, the \\ncause of FTT is multifactorial with interaction between multiple \\nbiological and psychosocial factors. FTT can be caused by \\ninadequate nutritional intake (e.g., neurological condition \\nimpeding feeding, improper mixing of formula, food insecurity), \\nmalabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, milk protein allergy), and/\\nor increased metabolic demands (e.g., cardiac disease, chronic \\ninfection). Clinical studies suggest that major organic diseases \\nare detected in a minority of patients with FTT. As outlined \\nin Table 21.2, the common causes of FTT vary by age.\\nDIAGNOSIS AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFailure to Thrive\\nA careful history and physical examination are the corner-\\nstone of FTT evaluations. A medical history should include \\nprenatal history, gestational age and perinatal history, birth \\nsize (weight, length, and head circumference), family, and \\ntravel history. Indicators of medical diseases, such as vomiting, \\ndiarrhea, fever, respiratory symptoms, and fatigue, should be \\nnoted. A careful diet history is essential. Lactation problems \\nin breast-fed infants and improper formula preparation are \\nfrequent causes of growth failure early in infancy. It is crucial \\nto evaluate intake of solid foods and liquids for older infants \\nand children. Due to parental dietary beliefs, some children \\nhave inappropriately restricted diets; others drink excessive \\namounts of fruit juice, leading to malabsorption or anorexia. \\nThe child’s daily meal schedule (timing, frequency, location) \\nshould also be noted. Mealtime practices, especially distractions \\nthat interfere with completing meals, can influence growth. A \\ncomplete psychosocial assessment of the child and family is \\nrequired. Child factors (temperament, development), parental \\nfactors (depression, domestic violence, social isolation, cogni-\\ntive deficits, substance abuse), and environmental and societal \\nfactors (poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, lead toxicity) all may \\ncontribute to growth failure.\\nA complete physical examination and developmental \\nscreening should assess signs of inflicted injury; oral or dental \\nproblems; indicators of pulmonary, cardiac, or gastrointestinal \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A complete neurological \\nexamination may reveal spasticity or hypotonia, which can \\nhave untoward effects on feeding and growth. Physical findings \\nrelated to malnutrition include decreased subcutaneous fat, \\ndecreased muscle mass, dermatitis, hepatomegaly, cheilosis, or \\nedema (see Chapter 30). Additionally, children with FTT have \\nmore otitis media, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections \\nthan age-matched controls; severely malnourished children are \\nat risk for a variety of serious infections. Observation during \\nfeeding and home visitation, if possible, is of great diagnostic \\nvalue in assessing feeding problems, food preferences, mealtime \\ndistractions, unusual or disruptive parent-child interactions, \\nand the home environment.\\nThe history and physical examination findings should guide \\nthe laboratory evaluation. Routine extensive laboratory and \\nradiology studies are not indicated, but rather tests should be \\nordered based on findings from the clinical evaluation.

In general, the simplest and least costly \\napproach to dietary change is warranted.\\nTreatment must also address the psychosocial needs of the \\nfamily. Parents of malnourished children may feel personally \\nresponsible and threatened by the diagnosis of FTT. Parents \\nmay be so depressed or dysfunctional they cannot focus on \\ntheir child’s needs; they may not recognize the psychosocial \\nand family contributors to malnutrition. These issues can have \\na profound effect on the success of treatment and need to be \\naddressed.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nMalnutrition causes defects in host defenses. Children with \\nFTT may suffer from a malnutrition-infection cycle, in \\nwhich recurrent infections exacerbate malnutrition, leading \\nto greater susceptibility to infection. Children with FTT must \\nbe evaluated and treated promptly for infection and followed  \\nclosely.\\nDuring starvation, the body slows metabolic processes and \\ngrowth to minimize the need for nutrients and uses its stores \\nof glycogen, fat, and protein to maintain normal metabolic \\nrequirements. The body also generally maintains homeostasis \\nand normal serum concentrations of electrolytes. With the rapid \\nreinstitution of feeding after starvation, fluid and electrolyte \\nhomeostasis may be lost. Changes in serum electrolyte con-\\ncentrations and the associated complications are collectively \\ntermed the re-feeding syndrome. These changes typically \\naffect phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium and \\ncan result in life-threatening cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological \\nproblems. Infants and children with marasmus, kwashiorkor, and \\nanorexia nervosa and those who experience prolonged fasting \\nare at risk for re-feeding syndrome. Re-feeding syndrome can \\nbe avoided by slow institution of nutrition, close monitoring \\nof serum electrolytes during the initial days of feeding, and \\nprompt replacement of depleted electrolytes.\\nThere is concern that FTT could be associated with negative \\nmetabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes in some cases; \\nhowever, further research is needed to more fully understand \\nlong-term health outcomes.\\nPSYCHOSOCIAL SHORT STATURE\\nOccasionally, children who live in psychological deprivation \\ndevelop short stature with or without concomitant FTT  \\nor delayed puberty, a syndrome called psychosocial short \\nstature. The signs and symptoms include polyphagia, poly-\\ndipsia, hoarding and stealing of food, gorging and vomiting, \\nand other notable behaviors. Affected children are typically \\ndepressed and socially withdrawn. Endocrine dysfunction is \\noften identified in affected children, who may have decreased \\ngrowth hormone secretion and a muted response to exogenous \\ngrowth hormone. Removal of the child from the adverse envi-\\nronment typically results in rapid improvement in endocrine \\nfunction and subsequent rapid somatic and pubertal growth \\nof the child. The prognosis for children with psychosocial \\nshort stature depends on the age at diagnosis and the degree \\nof psychological trauma. Early identification and removal \\nfrom the environment portends a healthy prognosis. Those \\ndiagnosed in later childhood or adolescence may not reach their \\ngenetic potential for growth and have a poorer psychosocial  \\nprognosis.\\nresulting from malnutrition. Initial tests may include a complete \\nblood count; screening for iron deficiency anemia and lead \\ntoxicity; urinalysis, urine culture, and serum electrolytes to \\nassess renal infection or dysfunction. A review of the child’s \\nnewborn screen may also be warranted. Additional testing can \\nbe ordered as needed, based on the child’s signs and symptoms. \\nFor example, a stool sample for culture and ova and parasites \\nmay be indicated in children with diarrhea, abdominal pain, \\nor malodorous stools.\\nTREATMENT\\nIdentified biopsychosocial etiologies will inform the treatment \\nplan. Most children with FTT can be treated in the outpatient \\nsetting. Children with severe malnutrition, underlying diagnoses \\nthat require hospitalization for evaluation or treatment, or whose \\nsafety is in jeopardy because of maltreatment require hospitaliza-\\ntion. Admitting children to the hospital to induce and document \\nweight gain is not recommended unless intensive outpatient \\nevaluation and intervention has failed or the social circumstances \\nare a contraindication for attempting outpatient management. \\nPotential multidisciplinary treatment team members include \\npediatricians, nutritionists, developmental specialists, nurses, \\nand social workers.\\nNutritional management is the cornerstone of treatment. \\nChildren with FTT who are anorexic and picky eaters may \\nhave difficulty consuming the amount of calories and protein \\nneeded for catch-up growth, and require calorie dense foods. \\nFor formula-fed infants, the concentration of formula can \\nbe adjusted appropriately (Table 21.3). For toddlers, dietary \\nchanges should include increasing the caloric density of favorite \\nfoods. High-calorie oral supplements (30 cal/oz) are often well \\ntolerated by toddlers. In some cases, specific carbohydrate, fat, \\nor protein additives are used to boost calories by increasing \\ncalories without increasing volume requirements. Additionally, \\nvitamin and mineral supplementation can be required, especially \\nTABLE 21.3 Infant Formula Preparation*\\nAMOUNT OF POWDER/\\nLIQUID\\nAMOUNT OF \\nWATER (OZ)\\nFINAL \\nCONCENTRATION \\n(kcal/oz)\\n1 cup powdered formula 29 20\\n4 scoops powdered formula 8 20\\n13 oz liquid concentrate 13 20\\n1 cup powdered formula 24 24\\n5 scoops powdered formula 8 24\\n13 oz liquid concentrate 9 24\\n1 cup powdered formula 21 27\\n5.5 scoops powdered \\nformula\\n8 27\\n13 oz liquid concentrate 6 27\\n*Final concentrations are reached by adding formula to water.

Each year in the United States, \\napproximately 3 million reports are made to child welfare \\nagencies. These reports represent only a small proportion of \\nthe children who suffer from child maltreatment; surveys of \\nadults about their childhood experiences indicate that many \\ncases never come to the attention of authorities. Child maltreat-\\nment can cause short-term physical, mental, and developmental \\nhealth problems, and in extreme cases can be fatal. Research, \\nincluding the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study, has shown \\nan association between childhood maltreatment and negative \\nadult health outcomes, including physical health problems such \\nas cardiovascular disease and obesity, as well as psychosocial \\nhealth problems such as depression and substance abuse. A \\ngrowing body of research demonstrates how toxic stressors in \\nchildhood can influence brain development and epigenetics.\\nChild maltreatment is an act or failure to act by a parent or \\ncaretaker that results in death, harm, sexual abuse, or imminent \\nrisk of harm. States define child abuse and neglect in civil and \\ncriminal statutes. In every state, physicians are mandated by \\nlaw to report all cases of suspected child abuse and neglect. \\nChild abuse and neglect result from a complex interaction \\nof individual, family, and societal risk factors. Risk factors \\nfor maltreatment, such as parental substance abuse, parental \\ndepression, and domestic violence in the household, can alert \\nphysicians to potential risk and guide development of child \\nmaltreatment prevention strategies. However, risk factors should \\nnot be used to determine whether a specific patient is a victim \\nof abuse. Child abuse and neglect are often considered in broad \\ncategories that include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional \\nabuse, and neglect.\\nNEGLECT\\nNeglect is the most common form of child maltreatment and \\nis broadly defined as omissions that prevent a child’s basic \\nneeds from being met. Basic needs include adequate nutrition, \\nshelter, education, emotional needs, adequate supervision, as \\nwell as medical and dental care. Neglect can impact child \\nphysical, mental, developmental, and behavioral health. Potential \\nphysical health consequences include abnormal growth, poor \\ndentition, injuries, or ingestions resulting from lack of supervi-\\nsion or environmental hazards, as well as poorly controlled \\nhealth problems. Child neglect can contribute to developmental \\ndelays, risk-taking behaviors or other behavioral problems, \\nschool difficulties, emotional problems, as well as attachment \\nproblems. Health care providers play an important role in the \\nmultidisciplinary response to neglect. Medical interventions \\ncould include treating physical health problems such as growth \\ndisturbance or injury, simplifying and clarifying treatment plans \\nfor chronic conditions, making referrals to community agencies \\nthat can assist with concrete needs such as food or transporta-\\ntion, providing developmental assessments and referrals, as \\nwell as referring patients to mental and behavioral health \\nspecialists.

In some cases, the \\ndiagnosis of physical abuse can be made easily if the child has \\nobvious external abusive injuries or is capable of providing \\na history of the abuse. In many cases, the diagnosis is not \\nobvious. Abusive injuries are sometimes occult, and children \\ncan present with nonspecific symptoms. The history provided \\nby the parent is often inaccurate because the parent is unwilling \\nto provide the correct history or is a nonoffending parent who \\nis unaware of the abuse. The child may be too young or ill to \\nprovide a history of the assault. An older child may be too \\nscared to do so or may have a strong sense of loyalty to the \\nperpetrator. History that seems incongruent with the clinical \\npresentation of the child raises concern for physical abuse  \\n(Table 22.1).\\nAlthough injury to any organ system can occur from physical \\nabuse, some injuries are more common. Bruises are universal \\nfindings in healthy ambulatory children but also are among the \\nmost common injury identified in abused children. Bruising \\nlocation, pattern, and the child’s age/developmental level are \\nimportant considerations when evaluating bruising.

Features of scald burns \\nthat are concerning for inflicted trauma include clear lines \\nof demarcation, uniformity of burn depth and characteristic \\npattern. Abusive contact burns tend to have distinct margins \\n(branding of the hot object), while accidental contact burns \\ntend to have less distinctive edges.\\nInflicted fractures occur more commonly in infants and \\nyoung children. Although diaphyseal fractures are most common \\nin abuse, they are nonspecific for inflicted injury. Fractures \\nthat should raise suspicion for abuse include fractures that \\nare unexplained; occur in young, nonambulatory children; or \\ninvolve multiple bones. Certain fractures have a high specificity \\nfor abuse, such as rib, metaphyseal, scapular, vertebral, or other \\nunusual fractures (Fig. 22.3). Some metabolic diseases can be \\nconfused with abuse and should be considered in the differential \\ndiagnosis when appropriate.\\nWhile abdominal injury is not as common as other forms of \\nchild physical abuse such as bruising or fractures, it is associated \\nwith a high mortality rate. Abdominal trauma is, therefore, \\nthe second leading cause of death from child physical abuse \\nafter head injury. Blunt trauma to the abdomen is the primary \\nmechanism of injury; infants and toddlers are the most common \\nvictims. Injuries to solid organs, such as the liver or pancreas, \\npredominate and hollow viscus injury occurs more commonly \\nwith inflicted trauma than accidental. Even in severe cases of \\ntrauma, there may be no bruising to the abdominal wall. The \\nlack of external trauma, along with an inaccurate history, can \\ncause delay in diagnosis. The American Academy of Pediatrics \\npolicy statement on diagnostic imaging of child abuse discusses \\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan as the imaging modality of \\nchoice in most settings when abusive abdominal trauma is \\nsuspected.\\nAbusive head trauma is the leading cause of mortality \\nand morbidity from physical abuse. Most victims are young; \\ninfants predominate. Shaking and/or blunt impact trauma \\ncause injuries. Caregiver intolerance of infant crying is a \\ncommon precipitator, and many prevention programs provide \\neducation on developmentally normal crying as well as coping \\ntechniques. Symptoms at the time of presentation to medical \\ncare can range from occult head trauma with no neurological \\nsymptoms to irritability, lethargy, vomiting, seizures, apnea, \\nand coma. Unsuspecting physicians misdiagnose approximately \\none third of infants initially; of these, more than 25% are \\nreinjured before diagnosis. Subdural hemorrhage is a common \\nintracranial injury in children with abusive head trauma (Fig. \\n22.4). Secondary brain injury can be due to factors such as \\ncerebral edema, hypoxic-ischemic injury, and hypoperfusion. \\nRetinal hemorrhages are seen in many but not all victims. \\nSkeletal trauma, including rib and classic metaphyseal \\nfractures, is sometimes present as well. Victims may present \\nwith bruising, but often times there are no external signs of \\ninjury. Survivors are at high risk for permanent neurological  \\nsequelae.\\nWork-up for physical abuse includes evaluation for occult \\ninjury as well as medical conditions that can mimic physical \\nabuse. Children younger than 2 years with suspected physical \\nabuse should undergo a skeletal survey looking for occult or \\nhealing fractures. Infants presenting with extra-cranial injuries \\nmay have occult head trauma, and therefore neuroimaging \\nmay be indicated for these infants. The extensive differential \\ndiagnosis of physical abuse depends on the type of injury  \\nthe body (Fig. 22.1). Bruises in healthy children generally are \\ndistributed over bony prominences; bruises that occur in an \\nunusual distribution, such as isolated to the torso, ears, or \\nneck, should raise concern. Bruises in nonambulatory infants \\nare unusual, occurring in less than 2% of healthy infants seen \\nfor routine medical care. Occasionally, a subtle bruise may \\nbe the only external clue to abuse and can be associated with \\nsignificant internal injury. Previous sentinel injuries, such as \\nbruising, are common among infants presenting with severe \\nphysical abuse. Appropriate evaluation and intervention when \\nnon-mobile infants present with unexplained bruising could \\nprevent escalating abuse.\\nBurns are common pediatric injuries and usually represent \\npreventable unintentional trauma (see Chapter 44). Approxi-\\nmately 10% of children hospitalized with burns are victims of \\nabuse.

Most \\nperpetrators are not strangers but are known to the child through \\nrelationships such as family member, neighbor, or member of \\nthe community. Most sexual abuse involves manipulation and \\ncoercion. Sexual abuse is more common in girls than boys, \\nalthough sexual abuse of boys is underrecognized and \\nunderreported.\\nChildren generally come to attention after they have made a \\ndisclosure of their abuse. They may disclose to a nonoffending \\nparent, sibling, relative, friend, teacher, counselor, or other \\nprofessional. Children commonly delay disclosure for many \\nweeks, months, or years after their abuse. Sexual abuse also \\nshould be considered in children who have behavioral problems, \\nalthough no behavior is pathognomonic. Hypersexual behaviors \\nshould raise the possibility of sexual abuse, although alternative \\nconsiderations include exposure to sexual content, as well as \\nother forms of maltreatment such as neglect. Sexual abuse \\noccasionally is recognized by the discovery of an unexplained \\nvaginal, penile, or anal injury or by the discovery of a sexu-\\nally transmitted infection. Medical providers may be asked to \\ndetermine the urgency of medical evaluations. Factors that \\nprompt emergent evaluation include child protection concerns \\nsuch as ongoing contact with the alleged perpetrator as well as \\nactive physical or psychological symptoms such as bleeding or \\nsuicidal ideation. Timing of the last possible incident of abuse is \\nalso an important consideration, as there are time windows for \\ncollecting forensic evidence, administering sexually transmitted \\n(Table 22.2). For children who present with different types \\nof specific injuries to multiple organ systems, an exhaustive \\nsearch for medical diagnoses is unwarranted. Some medical \\nconditions can be mistaken for abuse, emphasizing the need \\nfor careful, objective evaluation of all children.\\nAB C\\nFIGURE 22.3 A, Metaphyseal fracture of the distal tibia in a 3-month-old infant admitted to the \\nhospital with severe head injury.

In cases in which the sexual \\nabuse has been reported to Child Protective Services (CPS) \\nor the police (or both), and the child has been interviewed \\nbefore the medical visit, a complete forensic interview at the \\nphysician’s office is not needed. Many communities have systems \\nin place including Children’s Advocacy Centers to ensure quality \\ninvestigative interviews of sexually abused children. However, \\nchildren may make spontaneous disclosures to the physician, or \\nphysicians may evaluate patients prior to investigative interviews \\nand require information for medical decision making. In these \\ncircumstances, open-ended and nonleading questions should \\nbe used and carefully documented in the medical record. \\nInformation about the medical review of systems, including \\nphysical symptoms (examples: genital discharge, pain) and \\nbehavioral/emotional health (e.g., suicidal ideation, depression, \\nsleep problems), should also be obtained from the patient and/or \\nthe caregiver, as appropriate for the child’s developmental level.\\nThe physical examination should be complete, with careful \\nexternal inspection of the genitals and anus. Most sexually abused \\nchildren have a normal genital examination at the time of the \\nmedical evaluation; injuries are diagnosed in only approximately \\n5% of sexually abused children. Many types of sexual abuse \\n(fondling, vulvar coitus, oral genital contact, exhibitionism) do \\nnot injure genital tissue or do not even involve contact with the \\ngenital tissue. Genital mucosa heals so rapidly and completely \\nthat injuries often heal by the time of the medical examination. \\nFor children who present within 72 hours of the most recent \\nassault, special attention should be given to identifying acute \\ninjury. Guidelines based on research and expert consensus can \\nassist clinicians in differentiating normal variants or nonspecific \\nfindings from findings caused by trauma. Examples of the latter \\ninclude acute, unexplained lacerations or ecchymosis of the \\nhymen, and complete transection of the hymen. Injuries to other \\nparts of the body such as the oral mucosa, breasts, or thighs \\nshould not be overlooked. Forensic evidence collection is also \\na consideration when children present acutely.

A pediatri-\\ncian who provides an open and nonjudgmental environment \\nwill also be a valuable resource for an adolescent with questions \\nabout sexual behaviors, homosexuality, and/or gender identity \\n(Table 23.1).\\nDEVELOPMENT OF SEXUALITY\\nSexual development begins early on in childhood. Often, parents \\nexpress concern when their male infant has an erection, or \\nwhen their child touches his/her genitals during diaper changes \\nor bathing. During the preschool period, masturbation occurs \\nin both sexes. Reassurance from the pediatrician is critical as \\nthese behaviors are part of typical child development, represent \\nnormal exploration of the body, and should not be treated \\npunitively. However, it is important for children by age 3 years \\nto learn the proper anatomical names for their body parts and \\nthat genitals and sexual behaviors are private. It is common \\nfor pre-elementary age children to touch their genitals in public. \\nHowever, showing their genitals to others, “playing doctor, ” or \\nimitating intercourse or other adult sexual behaviors is unusual \\nat this age. If this behavior is occurring, the child should be \\nevaluated for exposure to inappropriate sexual material and \\npossible sexual abuse (see Chapter 22).\\nChildren in elementary school are typically intrigued by the \\ntopics of pregnancy, birth, and gender roles. They often will begin \\nto preferentially play with children of the same gender. Their \\nlonger in some states. Research showing that forensic evidence \\nis rarely recovered from swabs collected from the bodies of \\nprepubertal children 24 hours after assault may also influence \\nlocal practice.\\nThe laboratory evaluation  of a sexually abused child is \\ndictated by the child’s age, history, and symptoms. Universal \\nscreening for sexually transmitted infections for prepubertal \\nchildren is unnecessary because the risk of infection is low \\nin asymptomatic young children. The type of assault, identity \\nand known medical history of the perpetrator, and the epide-\\nmiology of sexually transmitted infections in the community \\nalso are considered. Testing methods for C. trachomatis and \\nN. gonorrhea have evolved with the advent of nucleic acid \\namplification tests (NAAT) and the declining use of culture, \\nwith many labs no longer offering testing by culture. Local \\nexperts, such as specialists in infectious diseases and laboratory \\nmedicine, can inform protocols for confirmation of positive \\nNAATs. The diagnosis of most sexually transmitted infections \\nin young children requires an investigation for sexual abuse (see  \\nChapter 116).\\nPediatric health care providers should also be cognizant of \\nchild sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. It can \\nbe difficult to identify potential victims, but possible potential \\nindicators include changing demographic information, a child \\nnot allowed to speak for himself/herself, a child accompanied \\nby an unrelated adult, history of multiple sexually transmitted \\ninfections, tattoos concerning for branding, and signs of inflicted \\ninjury. In addition to local resources, there is a National Human \\nTrafficking Resource Center.\\nMANAGEMENT\\nThe management of child abuse includes medical treatment \\nfor injuries and infections, and careful medical documentation \\nof verbal statements and findings. Photographic documentation \\nof physical examination findings can be helpful when possible. \\nPhysicians are mandated to report suspected child maltreatment \\nto the appropriate authorities (Fig. 22.5). Parents should be \\ninformed of the concerns and the need to report to CPS, focusing \\non the need to ensure the safety and well-being of the child. \\nCrimes that are committed against children also are investigated \\nby law enforcement, so the police become involved in some, \\nbut not all, cases of suspected abuse. Physicians should be aware \\nof the potential long-term impacts of maltreatment on child \\nhealth. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy has been \\nshown to improve mental health and behavioral difficulties \\namong children who have experienced trauma. Physicians \\noccasionally are called to testify in court hearings regarding \\ncivil issues, such as dependency and custody, or criminal issues. \\nCareful review of the medical records and preparation for court \\nare needed to provide an educated, unbiased account of the \\nchild’s medical condition and diagnoses.\\nThe prevention of child maltreatment is a great challenge. \\nThere are a few partially successful primary prevention programs. \\nVisiting home nursing programs that begin during pregnancy \\nand continue through early childhood may reduce the risk \\nof abuse and neglect. Physician training in screening for risk \\nfactors in parents has shown to be supportive of families and \\nreduce child maltreatment in some populations. Ultimately, \\nphysicians need to remain cognizant of the diagnosis, aware of \\ntheir professional mandates, and willing to advocate on behalf \\nof these vulnerable patients.\\nTABLE 23.1 Terminology\\nGender identity\\n Internal sense of one’s self as male, female, or other\\nCisgender\\n An individual whose gender identity aligns with physical sex \\ncharacteristics\\nTransgender\\n An individual whose gender identity and expression is not \\nconsistent with the sex assigned at birth\\nGender role\\n Culturally derived associations for behaviors and appearance \\nthat signal being male or female\\nGender expression\\n Behaviors and appearance used to communicate one’s gender \\nidentity\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Although many parents \\nare supportive of their child’s sexual orientation, some parents, \\nparticularly those who view this behavior as immoral, may reject \\ntheir child. Adolescents should be counseled that even parents \\nwhose initial reaction is one of shock, fear, or grief can come \\nto accept their child’s homosexuality. Homosexual youth are \\nat a high risk for homelessness as a consequence of parental \\nrejection. Interventions designed to change sexual orientation \\nare strongly opposed and are not only unsuccessful, but can \\nbe detrimental to the mental health of the child or adolescent. \\nHealth care providers should provide reassurance to parents \\nfeeling guilt or shame by affirming that sexual minority youth \\nare normal and sexual orientation is not related to parenting \\npractices. Evidence supports improved health outcomes for \\nsexual minority youth who experience family connectedness \\nand receive encouragement and positive support for their sexual \\norientation from their parents. For medical and psychosocial \\nreasons, health care providers need to provide an environment \\nin which adolescents feel comfortable discussing their sexual \\norientation and families can find the support and resources \\nthey need (Table 23.2).\\nSexual orientation, the pattern of physical and emotional \\narousal toward another person, is not always the same as sexual \\nbehavior. Typically, an individual’s sexual orientation emerges \\nbefore or early in adolescence. Although many adolescents \\nhave sexual experiences with a same-sex partner (10-25%, \\nand more often reported by males than females), fewer will \\naffirm homosexual sexual orientation by late adolescence. By \\n18 years of age, the majority of individuals endorse certainty \\naround their sexual orientation.\\nHOMOSEXUALITY\\nThere is no reliable way to predict an individual’s sexual orienta-\\ntion. Identical twins (even twins raised in separate families) \\nshow a higher concordance rate for sexual orientation than \\nwould be expected by chance alone, but nowhere near 100%, \\nas would be expected if genetics were the sole determinant. \\nAttempts to correlate brain imaging or levels of androgens and \\nestrogens with sexual orientation have thus far been inconsistent \\nat best. Although it is well established that parents tend to treat \\nboys and girls differently, there is no evidence that parental \\nbehavior alters the developmental trajectory towards a particular \\nsexual orientation.\\nIt is currently estimated that about 10% of adults self-identify \\nas homosexual, meaning they are attracted to people of the \\nsame gender. Homosexual children and adolescents face \\nstigmatization derived from homophobia and heterosexism, \\nostracism, and family rejection. A persistent negative societal \\nattitude toward homosexuality is reflected in the higher rates \\nof social isolation, verbal harassment, and physical assault \\nexperienced by sexual minority youth. Additionally, educational \\nand unbiased information about homosexuality is often not \\navailable in school and community settings, and homophobic \\njokes, teasing, and violence are common. Not surprisingly, \\nsexual minority youth are at high risk for having a negative \\nself-esteem, mental health issues, substance abuse, and sexual \\nrisk-taking behaviors. Sexual minority youth are more than twice \\nas likely to report considering suicide than their heterosexual \\npeers; rates of legal and illegal substance abuse are significantly  \\nhigher.\\nThere are also significant health disparities for sexual minor-\\nity youth related to sexual health outcomes. Although sexual \\nbehaviors, not sexual orientation, determine risk of sexually \\ntransmitted infections (STI), sexual minority youth are more \\nlikely to have had intercourse at a younger age, less likely to \\nuse contraception, and report a greater number of sexual \\npartners as compared to heterosexual peers. Rates of STI in \\nthe minority group of men who have sex with men (MSM) \\nhave not declined along with the downward trend of STI in \\nadolescents overall, including rates of human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV). Although education about safe sexual practices \\nshould be part of all adolescent well-child visits, Centers for \\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend \\nasking about the gender of all sex partners as part of STI risk \\nassessment. Health care providers should be aware of specific STI \\nscreening recommendations for MSM related to anal intercourse \\n(see Chapter 116). Many adolescents who identify as women \\nwho have sex with women (WSW) have also had sex with \\nmen and will require cervical cancer screening per guidelines. \\nImmunization for human papillomavirus per CDC guidelines \\nis recommended for adolescents regardless of gender or sexual \\nbehavior.

Evidence is mounting that allowing social transitions for \\nprepubescent transgender children may be linked to improved \\nmental health outcomes. This involves family acceptance and \\nallows the child to present in all aspects as the gender role that \\naligns with his/her gender identity, and not the gender assigned \\nat birth. In 2009, the Endocrine Society published guidelines that \\nrecommend considering reversible suppression of puberty using \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. Specialty centers with \\nmultidisciplinary teams now exist across the country to address \\nthe many needs of transgender children and their families.\\nCHAPTER 24 \\nFamily Structure and Function\\nA family is a dynamic system of interactions among biologically, \\nsocially, or legally related individuals. As such, families have a \\nunique power to influence a child’s social, emotional, and \\nphysical health, shape their brain development, and impact \\nhis/her overall developmental trajectory. When a family func-\\ntions well, interactions support the physical and emotional \\nneeds of all members and the family can serve as a valuable \\nresource for any individual member in need. Alternatively, the \\nproblems of an individual member or the negative interactions \\nbetween members may interfere with the ability of the family \\nsystem to satisfy the physical and emotional needs of members, \\nand ultimately lead to physical and/or emotional harm. The \\nconsequence of a social practice or behavior pattern that \\nundermines the stability of a family unit is referred to as family \\ndysfunction.\\nFAMILY FUNCTIONS\\nThe functions that families carry out in support of their children \\ncan be considered within the broad categories of physical needs, \\nemotional support, and education and socialization (Table 24.1). \\nWithin these groupings, all families have strengths and weak-\\nnesses. The amount of support that an individual child needs \\nin each domain varies with the child’s developmental level, \\npersonality, temperament, health status, personal experiences, \\nand stressors. In a healthy family, parents can be counted on to \\nprovide consistent and appropriate support for their children. \\nEither too much or too little support can interfere with optimal \\nchild health and development. In the case of child neglect the \\nfamily underfunctions, providing inappropriate or inadequate \\nsupport for the child’s basic needs. Further, the violation of basic \\nboundaries of appropriate behavior and infringement on safety is \\nconsidered child abuse. In contrast, a family that overfunctions \\nmay limit a child’s opportunity for growth and development \\nof independence skills, creating feelings of helplessness and \\ninadequacy. Parental anxiety and perfectionism creates intense \\npressure on children around achievement and sets them up to \\nbecome anxious and fearful themselves.\\nToxic stress can accumulate when the child experiences \\nintense, frequent, and prolonged adversity whether it be from \\nDEVELOPMENT OF GENDER IDENTITY\\nDeveloping an awareness and appreciation for one’s gender \\nidentity is an important milestone in psychosocial development. \\nTypically, a child self-identifies as a boy or a girl by age 2 years \\nand begins to demonstrate initial expressions of gender identity. \\nCross-gendered behaviors, such as stating that one wants to \\nbe a member of the opposite sex and/or pretending to be so, \\nare common in preschool years. However, gender constancy, \\nthe understanding that one is always a male or always a female, \\nis typically achieved by age 6 years.\\nMost elementary school–age children show a strong and \\nconsistent gender identity, and their behaviors (gender roles) \\nreflect this. If a child this age is engaging in cross sex gender role \\nbehaviors, or playing with toys that are stereotypically associated \\nwith the opposite gender, parents may be concerned about \\nteasing/bullying or about the child’s eventual sexual orienta-\\ntion. In assessing parental concerns about atypical gender role \\nbehaviors, the type of behavior exhibited and its consistency \\nand persistence over time should be considered. Reassurance is \\nappropriate when these behaviors are part of a flexible repertoire \\nof male and female gender roles or in response to a stressor, \\nsuch as the birth of an infant of the opposite sex or divorce of \\nthe parents. In contrast, stating the desire to be, or asserting \\nthat one is, of the opposite gender, and demanding clothing, \\nhairstyles, privileges, and/or to be called a name classically \\nused for the opposite gender, is uncommon. A referral for \\nevaluation for gender dysphoria (GD) is appropriate when \\nthere is a nearly exclusive preference in cross-gender roles in \\nplay, playmates, and games/activities stereotypically associated \\nwith the opposite gender combined with a dislike of one’s sexual \\nanatomy and a desire to be of the other gender persists beyond \\na period of 6 months and is distressing as it impairs the child’s  \\nfunctioning.\\nGENDER DYSPHORIA\\nGD is defined as marked distress related to the inconsistency \\nbetween the way an individual may feel and think of themselves \\n(experienced/expressed gender) and the individual’s physical \\nor assigned gender. GD represents a revision of the Diagnostic \\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,  fourth edition \\n(DSM-IV), diagnosis of gender identity disorder and embodies \\nan effort to remove the stigmatizing impact of the term “dis-\\norder” while maintaining a diagnosis in DSM-V to ensure \\ninsurance coverage for medical interventions. According to \\nDSM-V , in children, GD is 2–4.5 times more common among \\nnatal boys than among natal girls. By adolescence, the male-\\nto-female ratio is closer to even. There are some associations \\nbetween gender atypical behavior in young children and the \\nultimate development of same-sex attraction; many children \\nwith GD grow up to be adults who identify as bisexual or \\nhomosexual.\\nIn contrast, the term transgender refers to an individual \\nthat does not conform to the culturally-derived gender role for \\nthe sex they were assigned at birth. A person can have GD, a \\nmedical diagnosis, without being considered transgender. The \\nmajority of children with GD will not identify as transgender \\nduring adolescence and adulthood. There are data to support \\nthat children with GD who demonstrate more insistence in \\naffirming their gender identity, use more declarative language, \\nand are more significantly distressed by their body may be \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

For single-mother households, the median \\nincome is only 40% of the income in two-parent families, and \\nfor single-father households, it is only 60% of the income of two \\nparent families. Thus the frequency of children living in poverty \\nis three to five times higher in single-parent families. These \\nparents must also rely to a greater extent on other adults for \\nchild care. Although these adults may be sources of support for \\nthe single parent, they also may criticize the parent, decreasing \\nconfidence in parenting skills. Fatigue associated with working \\nand raising a child independently contributes to parenting \\ndifficulties. Single parents are likely to have less time for a \\nsocial life or other activities, intensifying feelings of isolation \\nand negatively impacting mental health. When the increased \\nburdens of single parenting are associated with exhaustion, \\nisolation, and depression, the evolution of developmental and \\nbehavioral problems in the child is more likely.\\nIn the case of a teenage mother in the role of single parent, \\nchallenges associated with parenting may be even more impact-\\nful (see Section 12). Being a teenage parent is associated with \\nlower educational attainment, lower paying jobs without much \\nopportunity for autonomy or advancement, and lower self-\\nesteem. Teenage mothers are even less likely than adult single \\nmothers to receive any support from the child’s father. Children \\nof adolescent mothers are at high risk for cognitive delays, \\nbehavioral problems, and difficulties in school. Referral to early \\nintervention services or Head Start programs is imperative in \\nthese situations.\\nHowever, when a single parent has adequate social supports, \\nis able to collaborate well with other care providers, and has \\nsufficient financial resources, he or she is likely to be successful \\nin raising a child. Pediatricians can improve parental self-esteem \\nthrough education about child development and behavior, \\nvalidation of good parenting strategies, positive feedback for \\ncompliance, and demonstrating confidence in them as parents. \\nDemonstrating empathy and acknowledging the difficulties faced \\nby single parents can have a healing effect or help a parent feel \\ncomfortable to share concerns suggesting the need for a referral \\nto other professionals.\\nChildren Living With Sexual Minority Parents\\nAn estimated 23% of all lesbian/gay/bisexual (LGB)-identified \\nadults (regardless of relationship status) were raising children \\nunder age 18 based on the 2013 National Health Interview \\nSurvey. Sexual minority adults can build families in a variety \\nof ways. Many children with an LGB parent were conceived \\nin the context of a heterosexual relationship. Alternatively, single \\nLGB parents, as well as same-gender couples, enter into parent-\\nhood through adoption, donor insemination, or surrogacy. It \\nis estimated that there are almost 200,000 children being raised \\nby same-sex couples in the United States. Combined with those \\nchildren being raised by single sexual minority parents, an \\nestimated 2 million children in the United States have LGB \\nparents.\\nLGB parents and children born from a heterosexual rela -\\ntionship experience unique challenges. Navigating the complex \\nnetwork of past and present, opposite- and same-gender rela-\\ntionships can be stressful for the child who may already have \\ndifficulty accepting the change in family structure, living environ-\\nment, and disclosure of sexual orientation. In general, earlier \\ndisclosure of a parent’s homosexuality to children, especially \\nphysical/emotional abuse, caregiver substance abuse or untreated \\nmental illness, exposure to violence, or the secondary effects of \\neconomic hardship. Regardless of the type of family dysfunction, \\nprolonged activation of stress response systems can disrupt the \\ndevelopment of vital brain architecture and increase the risk for \\nstress-related disease and cognitive impairment into adulthood.\\nFAMILY STRUCTURE\\nThe traditional family consists of a married mother and father \\nand their biological children. The diversity in the structure of \\nthe family in the United States has increased dramatically; in \\n2010 only 65% of children were being raised by married parents. \\nToday, children may live with unmarried parents, single parents \\nof either gender, a parent and a stepparent, grandparents, parents \\nliving as a same-sex couple, or foster care families. There is \\nlittle evidence that family structure alone is a significant predictor \\nof child health or development. Regardless of family structure, \\nthe best predictor of secure child health and development is \\nthe presence of a loving adult or adults serving in a parental \\nrole committed to fulfilling a child’s basic needs. Stressful life \\nexperiences can test a family’s ability to promote optimal \\ndevelopmental outcomes, and different family structures face \\ndifferent challenges.\\nSingle-Parent Families\\nAt any one point in time, approximately 30% of children are \\nliving in single-parent families, and more than 40% of children \\nare born to unmarried mothers. In some instances, a child is \\nborn to a single mother by choice, but oftentimes the child is \\nthe result of an unplanned pregnancy. Children may also live \\nin single-parent families as the result of divorce or the death \\nof a parent (see Chapter 26). Although most children in single-\\nparent families are raised by mothers, single-father families \\nare increasing; in 2009 nearly 5% of children lived in single-father \\nfamilies.\\nTABLE 24.1 Important Roles Families Play in Supporting \\nChildren\\nPHYSICAL NEEDS\\nSafety\\nFood\\nShelter\\nHealth and health care\\nEMOTIONAL SUPPORT\\nAffection\\nStimulation\\nCommunication\\nGuidance/discipline\\nEDUCATION AND SOCIALIZATION\\nValues\\nRelationships\\nCommunity\\nFormal schooling\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

If the child has not had the standard \\nnewborn screening tests, the pediatrician may need to obtain \\nthese tests. Documented immunizations should be reviewed and, \\nif needed, a plan developed to complete the needed immuniza-\\ntions (see Chapter 94). Children may be at high risk for infection \\nbased on the biological mother’s social history or the country \\nfrom which the child was adopted, including infection with \\nhuman immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, \\ntuberculosis, syphilis, and parasites. A complete blood count \\nmay be needed to screen for iron deficiency.\\nA knowledgeable pediatrician also can be a valuable source \\nof support and advice about psychosocial issues. The pediatri-\\ncian should help the adoptive parents think about how they \\nwill raise the child while helping the child to understand the \\nfact that he or she is adopted. Neither denial of nor intense \\nfocus on the adoption is healthy. Parents should use the term \\nadoption around their children during the toddler years and \\nexplain the simplest facts first. Children’s questions should be \\nanswered honestly. Parents should expect the same or similar \\nquestions repeatedly and that during the preschool period the \\nchild’s cognitive limitations make it likely the child will not fully \\nunderstand the meaning of adoption. As children get older, \\nthey may have fantasies of being reunited with their biological \\nparents and there may be new challenges as the child begins to \\ninteract more with individuals outside of the family. Families \\nmay want advice about difficulties created by school assignments \\nsuch as creating a genealogic chart or teasing by peers. During \\nthe teenage years, the child may have questions about his or \\nher identity and a desire to find his or her biological parents. \\nAdoptive parents may need reassurance that these desires do not \\nrepresent rejection of the adoptive family but the child’s desire \\nto understand more about his or her life. Feelings of loss and \\ngrief, as well as anger, anxiety, or fear, may occur more often \\nduring certain milestones, such as birthdays, graduation, or the \\ndeath of a parent. In general adopted adolescents should be \\nsupported in efforts to learn about their past, but most experts \\nrecommend encouraging children to wait until late adolescence \\nbefore deciding to search actively for the biological parents.\\nIn general, adopted children are within range of nonadopted \\npeers academically and emotionally; however, the likelihood \\nof emotional and academic problems is higher for children \\nadopted after 9 months of age or for children who experienced \\nmultiple placements before being adopted. Difficulties in school, \\nlearning, and behavioral problems are thought to be more often \\nsecondary to biological and social influences that preceded the \\nadoption. The pediatrician can play an important role in helping \\nfamilies distinguish developmental and behavioral variations \\nfrom problems that may require recommendations for early \\nintervention, counseling, or other services.\\nFoster Care\\nThe foster care system in the United States is a means of provid-\\ning care and protection for children who require out-of-home \\nplacement due to reasons of abuse and/or neglect. A foster or \\nkinship setting is beholden with the responsibility to promote \\nchild well-being by assuring access to health, safety, and stability. \\nbefore adolescence, is associated with better acceptance. Parents \\nmay have concerns that the child will encounter teasing by peers, \\ndisapproval from adults, and stress or isolation related to a social \\nstigma associated with having an LGB parent. Although there \\nis some evidence that children of sexual minority parents may \\nhave an increased likelihood of being teased at certain stages \\nof development, strong parent-child relationships and a school \\ncurriculum addressing acceptance can offer some protection \\nto overall child well-being.\\nEvidence suggests that there is no causal relationship between \\nhaving a sexual minority parent and a child’s emotional, \\npsychosocial, and behavioral development. Growing up in a \\nsame-gender parent family is not associated with academic \\nachievement. Additionally, having an LGB parent does not \\ninfluence gender role and psychosexual development; the \\nmajority of children with an LGB parent identify as hetero-\\nsexual. Importantly, extensive research has demonstrated that \\nthe psychological adjustment of children and adolescents is \\nimpacted by the quality of the parent-child relationship, the \\nquality of the relationship between adult caregivers, and the \\navailability of social and economic resources.\\nAdoption\\nAdoption is a legal and social process that provides full family \\nmembership to a child who is not the adult parent’s biological \\noffspring. Most adoptions in the United States involve U.S. \\nparents adopting U.S. children, but shifting cultural trends have \\nincreased the diversity in the ways in which adoptions occur; \\nthe process can involve biologically related and unrelated \\nchildren, stepchildren, adoption through private and public \\nagencies, domestic and international adoptions, and independent \\nand informal adoptions. Based on data from the U.S. Department \\nof Health and Human Services, the number of adoptions that \\nare finalized each year has remained relatively stable (between \\n50,000 and 53,500) over the last decade. Approximately 2% of \\nchildren in the United States are adopted. In 2009–2011, 13% \\nof adopted children under 18 were internationally adopted. \\nOver that same period, there were 438,000 transracially adopted \\nchildren under the age of 18 (over a third of whom were foreign \\nborn), or 28% of all adopted children under 18. Increasing \\nnumbers of same-gender couples or single-LGB adults are raising \\nchildren via adoption. Each type of adoption raises unique \\nissues for families and health care providers. Data suggests that \\nadopted children live in households that have higher incomes, \\na lower percentage in poverty, and a higher percentage with a \\nparent with at least a bachelor’s degree than stepchildren or \\nbiological children. Open adoptions in which the biological \\nparents and birth parents agree to interact are occurring with \\nincreased frequency and create new issues for the adoption \\ntriad (biological parent, adoptive parent, and child).\\nPediatricians are in an ideal position to help adoptive parents \\nobtain and evaluate medical information, consider the unique \\nmedical needs of the adopted child, and provide a source of \\nadvice and counseling from the preadoption period through \\nadolescence. A preadoption visit may allow discussion of medical \\ninformation that the prospective parents have received about the \\nchild and identify important missing information such as the \\nmedical history of the biological family and the educational and \\nsocial history of the biological parents. The preadoption period \\nis the time that families are most likely to be able to obtain \\nthis information. Depending on the preadoption history, there \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Prenatal use of alcohol can damage the fetus resulting \\nin a range of adverse effects known as fetal alcohol spectrum \\ndisorders (FASD). At the most severe end of the spectrum, \\nthis teratogen causes fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), character-\\nized by in utero and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, \\nintellectual disability, and a characteristic dysmorphic facial \\nappearance. Other manifestations of FASD include birth defects \\nand problems with coordination, attention, hyperactivity, \\nimpulsivity, learning, or behavior. Children with these difficulties \\nmay be diagnosed with FAS, partial FAS, alcohol-related birth \\ndefects (ARBD), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder \\n(ARND), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal \\nalcohol exposure (ND-PAE). Despite continued efforts to correlate \\nthe amount or pattern of alcohol use in pregnancy with the \\nmanifestations or likelihood of development of FASD, the only \\nconsensus is that the potential for fetal harm increases as \\nmaternal alcohol consumption intensifies. Importantly, ARBD \\nand developmental disabilities are entirely preventable with \\nabstinence from alcohol in pregnancy, and the neurocognitive \\nand behavioral problems that can result from prenatal alcohol \\nexposure are enduring.\\nOther substances may also impact the fetus. Studies of these \\neffects are complicated by the fact that substance use in preg -\\nnancy often involves multiple psychoactive substances as well as \\nsuboptimal nutrition and prenatal care in women who use these \\nsubstances. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated \\nwith lower birthweight and increased child behavioral problems. \\nUse of cocaine in the perinatal period has been associated \\nwith prematurity, impaired fetal growth, intracranial hemor-\\nrhages, and placental abruption. Exposure to opiates in utero \\ncan result in prematurity and neonatal abstinence syndrome \\ncharacterized by symptoms of withdrawal (irritability, poor \\nand irregular feeding, tachycardia and tachypnea, vomiting, \\nand hypertonia). Investigations of the effects of cocaine and \\nopiates on cognitive development have produced mixed results. \\nChildren with prenatal drug exposure are at increased risk \\nfor the development of neurobehavioral disorders, impaired \\nintellectual function and academic achievement, developmental \\nlanguage delays, and executive function deficits, as well as the \\nlater development of a substance use disorder themselves.\\nParental substance abuse is associated with increased family \\nconflict, decreased organization, increased isolation, and \\nincreased family stress related to marital and work problems. \\nChildren and adolescents of parents with substance use disor-\\nders are also at increased risk for serious medical conditions \\nand injuries. A 2011 study found that 23% of children whose \\nmothers were substance users failed to receive routine child \\nhealth services during the first 2 years of life. Family discord \\nand violence may be more frequent. Despite the fact that these \\nparents often have difficulty providing discipline and structure, \\nthey may expect their children to be independent at a variety of \\ntasks at a younger age as compared to parents who do not use \\npsychoactive substances. This sets the children up for failure \\nand contributes to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and \\nlow self-esteem. Academic difficulties are particularly common \\nin children exposed to parental substance use, likely as a result \\nof both prenatal exposure with subsequent cognitive or learning \\nimpairments and the unstructured and potentially unsafe home \\nenvironment. The parental attitude of acceptance toward alcohol \\nand drug use seems to increase the chance that their children \\nwill use substances during adolescence.\\nUltimately, the goal of foster care is to achieve permanency \\nthrough reunification or an alternative permanent arrangement \\n(adoption, guardianship, or placement with relatives).\\nFrom the late 1990s through 2005, over half a million children \\nwere in foster care, but between 2005 and 2010, the number of \\nchildren living in foster care decreased by about 20% as a result \\nof changes in federal and state policies; in 2013, approximately \\n641,000 children spent some time in foster care placement. The \\nAdoption and Safe Families Act passed by congress in 1997 \\nmandated timely permanency leading to a significant reduction \\nin the length of stay in foster care. In 2008, the enactment of \\nthe Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions \\nAct increased subsidies and supports to incentivize kinship care, \\nguardianship, and adoption out of foster care. Additional reforms \\nhave prioritized the improvement of outcomes for children \\nand youth in foster care by emphasizing monitoring of child \\ndevelopment and the availability of mental health supports to \\nensure emotional well-being.\\nChildren and adolescents in foster care are at extremely high \\nrisk for medical, nutritional, developmental, behavioral, and \\nmental health problems. At the time of placement in foster care, \\nmost of these children have received incomplete medical care and \\nhave had multiple detrimental life experiences. Comprehensive \\nassessments at the time of placement reveal many untreated \\nacute medical problems. Nearly half of foster children have a \\nchronic illness. Developmental delays and serious behavioral \\nor emotional disorders are common.\\nIdeally foster care provides a healing service for these \\nchildren and families, leading to reunification or adoption. \\nToo often, children experience multiple changes in placement \\nwithin the foster care system, further exacerbating challenges \\nin forming a connection between the child and adult caregivers \\nand culminating in child resistance to foster parents’ attempts \\nto develop a secure relationship. This detachment from the \\nfoster parent may be emotionally difficult for the foster parent \\nto bear, further perpetuating a cycle of placement failures. The \\nhistory of trauma or neglect that originally led to the need \\nfor foster care, in combination with instability of placements, \\npredisposes the foster child to enduring problems. Foster care \\nalumni report rates of anxiety disorders, depression, substance \\nabuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder that are two to six \\ntimes higher than the general population. Furthermore, although \\nthe protections of the foster care system often end at 18 years \\nof age, these adolescents rarely have the skills and maturity \\nneeded to allow them to be successful living independently. \\nThus the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing \\nAdoptions Act of 2008 mandates that effective transition to \\nadulthood planning be done with youth in foster care including \\nthe provision of targeted resources for emancipated youths as \\nthey enter adulthood.\\nThe challenges for the foster care system are great. However, \\nwhen children are placed with competent and nurturing foster \\nparents and provided with coordinated care from skilled \\nprofessionals, significant improvements in child health status, \\ndevelopment, and academic achievement typically ensue.\\nFAMILY DYSFUNCTION: PHYSICAL NEEDS\\nFailure to meet a child’s physical needs for protection or nutrition \\nresults in some of the most severe forms of family dysfunction \\n(see Chapters 21 and 22).

Witnessing violence in the family and/or community \\nwas also prevalent (approximately one quarter of children). \\nViolence is an important individual and public health concern \\ngiven its prevalence and impact on well-being.\\nINTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE  \\nAND CHILDREN\\nIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a pattern of purposeful \\ncoercive behaviors aimed at establishing control of one partner \\nover the other that may include inflicted physical injury, \\npsychological abuse, sexual assault, progressive social isolation, \\nstalking, deprivation, intimidation, and threats. Although partner \\nviolence often occurs between male perpetrators and female \\nvictims, it may also occur bidirectionally and may be better \\nconceptualized as family or interpersonal violence. Violence \\nmay escalate during the perinatal period.\\nIPV affects the lives of millions of children each year. \\nChildren experience IPV by seeing or hearing the violence \\nand its aftermath. Children may be injured during violent \\noutbursts, sometimes while attempting to intervene on behalf \\nof a parent. Many children are victims of abuse themselves. \\nIt is estimated that there is at least a 50% concurrence rate \\nbetween IPV and child abuse. Exposure to IPV can also impact \\nchild development, emotional health, and behavior. There is no \\nparticular behavioral consequence or disturbance that is specific \\nto children who witness IPV . Some children are traumatized \\nby fear for their caregiver’s safety and feel helpless. Others may \\nblame themselves for the violence. Children may have symp-\\ntoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, \\naggression, or hypervigilance. Older children may have conduct \\ndisorders, poor school performance, low self-esteem, or other \\nnonspecific behaviors. Infants and young toddlers are at risk for \\ndisrupted attachment and routines around eating and sleeping. \\nPreschoolers may show signs of regression, irritable behavior, \\nor temper tantrums. During school-age years, children may \\nshow both externalizing (aggressive or disruptive) and internal-\\nizing (withdrawn and passive) behaviors. Because of family \\nisolation, some children have no opportunity to participate in \\nextracurricular activities at school and do not form friendships. \\nAdolescents in homes where IPV is present have higher rates \\nof school failure, substance abuse, and risky sexual behaviors. \\nThese adolescents are more likely than their peers to enter into \\na violent dating relationship.\\nBecause of the high concurrence of IPV and child abuse, \\nasking about IPV is part of the screening for violence against \\nchildren. Recognizing the importance of IPV screening in \\npediatric practice, the American Academy of Pediatrics has \\nendorsed screening in this setting and suggests that intervening \\non behalf of battered women may be one of the most effective \\nmeans of preventing child abuse. Without standardized screen-\\ning, pediatricians may underestimate the IPV prevalence in their \\npractices. Parents should not be screened together. Questions \\nabout family violence should be direct, nonjudgmental, and \\ndone in the context of child safety and anticipatory guidance \\n(Table 25.1).\\nIntervention is needed for caregivers who disclose IPV . It is \\nappropriate to show concern and to provide available community \\nresources. It is important to assess the safety of the victim \\nand the children. In some states, physicians are mandated to \\nreport IPV . Information for families that provides details about \\ncommunity resources and state laws is helpful.\\nParents also may expose children directly to the harmful \\neffects of other substances, such as exposure to second hand \\ncigarette smoke, which is consistently associated with increased \\nrates of childhood respiratory illnesses, otitis media, and sudden \\ninfant death syndrome. Despite these effects, only a few parents \\nrestrict smoking in their homes. There are many other ways in \\nwhich parents may endanger the health of their children. Failing \\nto immunize children, to childproof the home adequately, and \\nto provide adequate supervision are other examples.\\nParents’ attempts to provide too much protection for their \\nchild can also have deleterious effects. One example of this \\nis the vulnerable child syndrome in which a child who is ill \\nearly in life continues to be viewed as vulnerable by the parents \\ndespite the child having fully recovered. Behavioral difficulties \\nmay result if parents are overindulgent and fail to set limits. \\nParental reluctance to leave the child may contribute to the \\nchild having separation anxiety. Parents may be particularly \\nattentive to minor variations in bodily functions, leading them \\nto seek excess medical care. If the physician does not recognize \\nthis situation, the child may be exposed to unnecessary medical \\nprocedures.\\nFAMILY DYSFUNCTION: EMOTIONAL \\nSUPPORT, EDUCATION, AND SOCIALIZATION\\nFailure to meet a child’s emotional or educational needs can \\nhave a severe and enduring negative impact on child develop-\\nment and behavior. Infants need a consistent adult who learns \\nto understand their signals and meets the infant’s needs for \\nattention as well as food. As the adult caregiver learns these \\nsignals, he or she responds more rapidly and appropriately to \\nthe infant’s attempts at communication. Through this process, \\noften referred to as attachment, the special relationship between \\nparent and child develops. When affectionate and responsive \\nadults are not consistently available, infants often are less willing \\nto explore the environment and may become unusually clingy, \\nangry, or difficult to soothe.\\nAppropriate stimulation is also vital for a child’s cognitive \\ndevelopment. Children whose parents do not read to them and \\ndo not play developmentally appropriate games with them have \\nlower scores on intelligence tests and experience more school \\nproblems. In these situations, early intervention has been shown \\nto be particularly effective in improving skill development and \\nsubsequent academic performance. At the other extreme, there \\nare increasing concerns that some parents may provide too \\nmuch stimulation and scheduling of the child’s day. There may \\nbe such emphasis on achievement that children come to feel \\nthat parental love is contingent. There are concerns that this \\nnarrow definition of success may contribute to problems with \\nanxiety and self-esteem for some children.\\nCHAPTER 25 \\nViolence\\nThe 2014 National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence \\nfound that close to two thirds of children experienced at least \\none self- or parent-reported direct exposure to violence in the \\npreceding year.

Often, these \\nrisk factors exist in clusters and tend to be additive. Although \\nunderstanding risk factors for violence is crucial for developing \\nprevention strategies, the risk factors do not predict whether a \\nparticular individual will become violent. It is also important to \\nidentify protective factors, which include school connectedness \\nas well as support of nonviolent family members and close  \\nfriends.\\nASSAULT AND BULLYING\\nThe National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence found \\nthat peers and siblings were the most common perpetrators of \\nphysical assault on youth. Other perpetrators of physical violence \\non youth include adults as well as groups or gangs. Assaults \\nsometimes involve a weapon. Assaults can result in significant \\nphysical injury. Homicide is one of the leading causes of death \\namong adolescents. Physical assaults can also have psychosocial \\nconsequences.\\nYo u t h  bullying is a form of aggression in which a child \\nor group of children repeatedly and intentionally intimidates, \\nharasses, or physically harms another child. Technology-\\nassisted bullying has become a major concern. Bullying peaks \\nin middle school. Psychosocial consequences of being bullied \\ninclude depression and suicidal ideation. Bullied youth may also \\nexperience negative physical, social, and educational outcomes. \\nPrevention strategies include talking to children about bul-\\nlying as well as how they can stand up to it and how to get \\nhelp. Strategies at the school level include policies and rules, \\neducation, and bullying reporting systems. National resources \\ninclude stopbullying.gov.\\nDATING VIOLENCE AND DATE RAPE\\nDating violence includes physical violence, emotional abuse \\n(such as name calling or shaming), sexual violence, and stalking. \\nThe 2013 National Y outh Risk Behavior Survey found that 21% \\nof female and 10% of male students who dated experienced \\nsome form of dating violence. Risk factors for dating violence \\ninclude initiating dating and sexual activity at an early age, \\nprior sexual abuse or victimization, and belief that dating \\nviolence is acceptable. Risk factors for perpetrating dating \\nviolence include witnessing or experiencing violence in the \\nhome, early initiation of sexual activity, and depression or \\nanxiety. Substance use is also a risk factor for harming a partner; \\nalcohol, marijuana, and cocaine may contribute. Flunitrazepam \\n(Rohypnol) and gamma hydroxybutyrate are two commonly \\nimplicated drugs that cause sedation and amnesia, especially \\nwhen used in conjunction with alcohol. Negative health out-\\ncomes of experiencing dating violence include depression and \\nanxiety, engaging in unhealthy behaviors, as well as repeat \\nvictimization.\\nRelatively few victims of date rape report the assault to \\nlaw enforcement. Women who report assaults to the police \\nare more likely to receive timely medical care; it is likely that \\nmany sexually assaulted adolescents do not receive medical \\nattention, putting them at risk for physical and mental health \\nconsequences. Health care providers can intervene by screen-\\ning for adolescent dating violence, providing routine sexually \\ntransmitted infection evaluation, and identifying counseling \\nresources for teens who are victims or perpetrators of dating \\nviolence (see Chapter 116).\\nYOUTH VIOLENCE\\nRates of juvenile arrests in the United States are approximately \\n3010 persons between the ages of 10 and 17 per 100,000. \\nComparison of data from the juvenile justice system and surveys \\nof self-reported behavior highlights that many juveniles commit \\nchargeable offenses and are never arrested. Self-reports of \\ndelinquent behavior involvement do not differ much between \\nwhite and minority adolescents, nor between urban and rural \\nyouth. However, urban and minority adolescents are more likely \\nto be arrested. Although boys commit more crimes than girls, \\nthis gap has narrowed.\\nMost violent youth begin to exhibit their delinquent behaviors \\nduring early adolescence. The prevalence of delinquent behaviors \\ndecreases in the late teens into early adulthood, and most \\nadolescent violence ends by young adulthood. Most violent \\nyouth are only intermittently violent. A small proportion \\nof delinquent youth commit frequent, serious crimes; these \\noffenders are more likely to have initiated delinquent activ-\\nity before puberty. Serious youth violence is not an isolated \\nproblem but usually coexists with other adolescent risk-taking \\nbehaviors, such as drug use, truancy, school dropout, and early \\nsexual activity as well as with mental health concerns.

Significant parental conflict can lead to separation or \\ndivorce. Parental illness or injury may create a brief or prolonged \\nperiod of separation, while the death of a parent results in a \\npermanent separation that may be anticipated or unanticipated. \\nAll of these disruptions cause significant stress for the child, \\nwith the potential for short- and long-term adverse conse -\\nquences. The child’s adaptation to these stresses is affected by \\nthe child’s developmental stage, temperament, parental behaviors, \\nand the availability of additional support systems.\\nDIVORCE\\nApproximately 50% of first marriages in the United States will \\nend in divorce. About half of these divorces occur in the first \\n10 years of marriage when couples have added children to their \\nfamily unit prior to the break-up. At least 25% of children \\nexperience the divorce or separation of their parents. Few events \\nin childhood are as dramatic and challenging for the child as \\ndivorce. Importantly, parental choices and behaviors around a \\ndivorce can help promote a healthy emotional adjustment for \\nthe child.\\nDivorce is likely to be accompanied by changes in behavioral \\nand emotional adjustment. In the immediate post-divorce \\nperiod, many children exhibit anger, noncompliance, anxiety, \\nand depression. Children from divorced families require \\npsychological help two to three times more frequently than \\nchildren with married parents. Long-term studies suggest that \\nin the absence of ongoing stressors, most children demonstrate \\ngood adjustment a few years after the divorce, but some have \\nenduring difficulties. Easygoing temperament and average to \\nabove-average cognitive functioning are child characteristics \\nassociated with improved coping skills.\\nDivorce is not a single event but a process that occurs \\nover time. In most cases, marital conflict begins long before \\nthe physical or legal separation, but the divorce brings about \\npermanent changes in the family structure. Multiple potential \\nstressors for the child are associated with divorce, including \\nparental discord before and after the divorce, changes in living \\narrangements and sometimes location, and changes in the child’s \\nrelationship with both parents. The environmental changes that \\ndisturb a child’s primary support system as a result of the divorce \\nprocess further complicate the child’s ability to adapt.\\nThe child’s relationship with each parent can be affected by \\nthe divorce. In the short-term, the parent is likely to experience \\nnew burdens and feelings of guilt, anger, or sadness that may \\ndisrupt parenting skills and family routines. Contact with \\nthe noncustodial parent may decline greatly. Parents may be \\nperceived by their children as being unaware of the child’s \\ndistress around the time of the divorce. Pediatricians can help \\nparents understand things they can do that will be reassuring to \\nthe child. Maintaining contact with both parents, seeing where \\nthe noncustodial parent is living, and, in particular, maintaining \\nfamiliar routines are comforting to the child in the midst of the \\nturmoil of a separation and divorce. The child should attend \\nschool and continue to have opportunities to interact with \\nfriends. Assistance from extended family can be essential, and \\nso it may be helpful for pediatricians to encourage parents to \\nask for this support. Pediatricians should look for maladaptive \\ncoping responses. Some parents may respond to their increased \\nburdens and distress by treating their children as friends with \\nwhom they share their suffering. Alternatively, they may place \\nunnecessary and excessive responsibilities on the child or leave \\nVIOLENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\\nTechnology use among youths is prevalent and evolving with \\nthe development of new applications and devices. Medical \\nproviders, educators, parents, and youth should be aware of \\nthe risks for violence through technology. Children can be \\nexposed to violence on television, the internet including social \\nmedia, and video games. Online sexual solicitation involves \\nrequests to engage in sexual activities or talk. In some cases, \\nthe solicitor attempts to make contact with the victim offline as \\nwell. Cyber bullying or electronic aggression refers to harassment \\nor other aggression perpetrated through technology including \\ntext messaging, websites, and social media. Negative outcomes \\nof electronic victimization include emotional distress, school \\nabsenteeism, and increased risk for in-person victimization. \\nAnticipatory guidance for technology violence prevention \\nincludes setting rules for technology use to regulate content, \\nlocation of use (i.e., common areas of the home), and amount \\nof time spent with technology. Adults should educate children \\non steps to take if they are victimized, including informing \\na trusted adult. Children should be advised not to give out \\npersonal information online, friend strangers on social media, \\nor meet someone known from the internet in person without \\nparental supervision.\\nTRAUMA INFORMED CARE\\nTraumatic experiences in childhood including directly experienc-\\ning or witnessing violence can impact physical and mental \\nhealth throughout the lifespan. Providing trauma-informed \\nmedical care includes realizing the prevalence and impact of \\ntrauma, recognizing signs and symptoms of trauma, as well as \\nresponding to the medical needs of traumatized patients. \\nExamples of trauma-related symptoms include sleep difficulties, \\nabnormal eating patterns (e.g., hoarding food, loss of appetite), \\nhypervigilance, anxiety, detachment, and decline in school \\nfunctioning. Anticipatory guidance for caregivers of children \\nwith trauma symptoms includes explaining the relationship \\nbetween symptoms and the trauma experience and reminding \\nthe caregiver not to take the behaviors personally. Examples \\nof anticipatory guidance for specific trauma-related symptoms \\ninclude developing routines for bedtime and eating, remaining \\ncalm when children act out, teaching children calming skills \\nsuch as breathing exercises, as well as helping children to verbal-\\nize emotions. Health care providers can also make referrals to \\ntrauma-informed mental health providers. Trauma-focused \\ncognitive behavioral therapy is an example of an approach that \\nhas been shown to benefit children who have experienced \\ntrauma.\\nCHAPTER 26 \\nDivorce, Separation, and \\nBereavement\\nThe primary responsibility for ensuring the optimal development \\nand well-being of children lies within the family.

Parents are encouraged to continue to provide \\nconsistent behavioral expectations while encouraging an open \\nforum for discussing the adolescent’s feelings.\\nOutcome of Divorce\\nRegardless of the age or developmental level of the child, children \\nthat are exposed to hostility and high levels of stress are at \\nincreased risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic struggles \\nin the future. One of the best predictors of children’s adaptation \\nto divorce is whether the physical separation is associated with \\na decrease in the child’s exposure to parental discord. In most \\ncases, divorced parents still must interact with each other around \\nthe child’s schedule, child custody and support, and other \\nparenting issues. These types of issues create the potential for \\nthe child to have ongoing exposure to significant discord between \\nthe parents. For example, if one parent tends to keep the child \\nup much later than the bedtime at the other parent’s house, \\nsleep problems may develop. When children feel caught in the \\nmiddle of ongoing conflicts between their divorced parents, \\nbehavior or emotional problems are much more likely. Regardless \\nof how angry parents are with each other, the parents should \\nbe counseled that they must shield their child from this animos-\\nity. Clear rules about schedules, discipline, and other parenting \\nroles is ideal, but in cases of conflict, it can also be helpful for \\nthe pediatrician to help a parent accept that he or she can only \\ncontrol his or her actions and decisions related to the child. \\nWhen parents have trouble resolving these issues, mediation \\nmay be helpful. Pediatricians need to be wary of parents’ attempts \\nto recruit them into custody battles to substantiate claims of \\npoor parenting unless the pediatrician has first-hand knowledge \\nthat the concerns are valid.\\nAlthough the primary physical residence for most children is \\nstill with the mother, the court’s bias toward preferring mothers \\nin custody decisions has decreased and there is more emphasis \\non including both parents in the child’s life. In the early 1980s, \\n50% of children had no contact with their fathers 2 or 3 years \\nafter a divorce, whereas today only 20-25% of children have no \\ncontact with their father. Most states now allow joint physical \\nor legal custody. In joint physical custody, the child spends a \\nsignificant amount of time with each parent, and in joint legal \\ncustody, parents share authority in decision making. Although \\njoint custody arrangements may promote the involvement of \\nboth parents in the child’s life, they also can be a vehicle through \\nwhich parents continue to express their anger at each other. \\nWhen parents have substantial difficulty working together, \\njoint custody is an inappropriate arrangement and has been \\nassociated with deterioration in the child’s psychological and \\nsocial adjustment.\\nDivorce often leads to financial difficulties. Family income \\nusually declines in the first year after the divorce. Only about \\nhalf of mothers who have child support awards receive the full \\namount, and one fourth receive no money at all. These financial \\nchanges may have multiple adverse effects on the child. A move \\nto a new house may require the child to attend a new school \\ndisrupting peer relationships and other potential supports. The \\nchild may spend more time in child care if one or both parents \\nhave to increase work hours.\\nMost men and women remarry within 5 years of divorce, \\nwith a slightly higher incidence of men who remarry than \\nwomen (approximately 60% vs. 50%, respectively). Most \\nthe child unsupervised for longer periods of time. Responses \\nsuch as these increase the chance that the child will develop \\nbehavioral or emotional problems.\\nReaction to Divorce at Different Ages\\nThe child’s reaction to the divorce is influenced by the child’s \\nage and cognitive development. Similarly, warning signs of \\nmaladjustment may look different at different stages of child \\ndevelopment. Although infants do not comprehend the concept \\nof divorce, their need for a stable daily routine and regular \\ncontact with a primary caregiver in order to develop secure \\nattachment requires special considerations in relation to custody \\nand visitation. Separations from a primary caregiver should \\nbe brief. Increased infant irritability, changes in sleep and \\nappetite patterns, and withdrawal or listlessness may be indica-\\ntors of distress. In the worst cases of family stress and neglect, \\nthe young child may fail to meet developmental milestones as \\nexpected. The developmental phase of preschool age children \\nis characterized by magical thinking about cause and effect \\nand an egocentric view of the world. They may believe that \\nsomething they did caused the divorce, or they may engage in \\nunusual behaviors that they believe will reunite the parents. \\nAt this age, parents need to provide a consistent and clear \\nmessage that the divorce was related to disagreements between \\nthe parents, that nothing the child did caused the divorce, and \\nthat nothing the child could do would bring the parents back \\ntogether again. Preschool children may reason that if the parents \\nleft each other they also might leave the child. To counteract \\nthis fear of abandonment, children may need one-on-one \\nattention and to be reassured that although parents separated, \\nthey will not abandon the child and that the child’s relationship \\nwith both parents will endure.\\nSchool-age children have a more concrete understanding of \\ncause and effect; if something bad happened, they understand \\nthat something caused it to happen. However, they are less likely \\nto appreciate the subtleties of parental discord or the idea that \\nmultiple factors contribute to a conflict. Children at this age \\nmay still worry that something they did caused the divorce. \\nThey may express more anger than younger children and often \\nfeel rejected. Many young school-age children worry about \\nwhat will happen to one or both parents. School performance \\noften deteriorates. Older elementary school–age children may \\nbelieve that one parent was wronged by the other. This belief, \\nin conjunction with their concrete understanding of cause and \\neffect, allows children to be easily co-opted by one parent to \\ntake sides against the other. Parents need to understand this \\nvulnerability and resist the temptation to support their child in \\ntaking sides, while allowing the child to express their feelings \\nopenly.\\nAdolescents may demonstrate difficulty adjusting to divorce \\nby acting out, becoming depressed, or experiencing somatic \\nsymptoms. Adolescents are developing a sense of autonomy, a \\nsense of morality, and the capacity for intimacy. Divorce may \\nlead them to question previously held beliefs. They may be \\nconcerned about what the divorce means for their future and \\nwhether they, too, will experience marital failure. Questioning \\nof previous beliefs, in conjunction with decreased supervision, \\nmay set the stage for risk-taking behaviors, such as truancy, \\nsexual behaviors, and alcohol or drug use. Adolescents with \\ndivorced parents, in comparison to those with married parents, \\nare at increased risk for internalizing problems like depression \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In the most \\ncontentious situations, a guardian ad litem can be appointed by \\nthe court to investigate and recommend what solutions would \\nbe in the “best interests” of a child.\\nSEPARATIONS FROM PARENTS\\nChildren experience separations from their primary caregiver \\nfor a variety of reasons. Brief separations, such as those to \\nattend school, camp, or other activities, are nearly a universal \\nexperience. Many children experience longer separations for \\na variety of reasons, including parental business trips, military \\nservice, or hospitalization. Child adjustment to separation is \\naffected by child factors (e.g., age of the child and the child’s \\ntemperament); factors related to the separation (e.g., length of \\nand reason for the separation, whether the separation was \\nplanned or unplanned); and factors related to the caregiving \\nenvironment during the separation (e.g., how familiar the child \\nis with the caregiver and whether the child has access to friends \\nand familiar toys and routines).\\nChildren between 6 months and 3-4 years of age often have \\nthe most difficulty adjusting to a separation from their primary \\ncaregiver. Older children may be better able to understand \\nthe reason for the separation, communicate their feelings, and \\ncomprehend the passage of time, allowing them to anticipate \\nthe parent’s return. For older children, the period immediately \\nbefore a planned separation may be particularly difficult if the \\nreason for the separation causes significant family tension, as \\nit may in the case of hospitalization or military service.\\nIf parents anticipate a separation, they should provide a clear \\nexplanation of the reason for the separation and, to the extent \\npossible, give concrete information about when the parent will \\nbe in contact with the child and when they will return home. \\nIf the child can remain at home with a familiar and responsive \\ncaregiver, this is likely to help adjustment. If children cannot \\nremain at home, they should be encouraged to take transitional \\nobjects, such as a favorite blanket, familiar toys, and important \\nobjects such as a picture of the parent, with them. Maintenance \\nof familiar family routines and relationships with friends should \\nbe encouraged.\\nDEATH OF A PARENT OR FAMILY MEMBER \\nAND BEREAVEMENT\\nWhen a child loses a parent, it is a devastating experience. \\nUnfortunately, this experience is not rare; by 15 years of age, \\n4% of children in the United States have experienced the death \\nof a parent. The death of a parent is likely to alter forever the \\nchild’s view of the world as a secure and safe place. The child’s \\ndevelopmental level and temperament and the availability of \\nsupport systems contribute to the child’s adjustment following \\nthe death of a parent. Many of the recommendations in Table \\n26.1 are helpful. The death of a parent or close family member \\nalso brings up some unique issues.\\nExplaining Death to a Child\\nChildren’s understanding of death changes with their cognitive \\ndevelopment and experiences (see Chapter 4). Preschool children \\noften do not view death as permanent and may have magical \\nbeliefs about what caused death. As children become older, \\nthey understand death as permanent and inevitable, but the \\nspouses in remarried couples already have children, such that \\nat least one third of American children become members of \\nstepfamilies. The adjustment to a parent dating and the transition \\nto a blended family pose additional challenges to the child. \\nParents are encouraged to be sensitive to the child’s reactions \\nand mindful of the importance of maintaining the biological \\nparents as disciplinarians.\\nRole of the Pediatrician\\nThe pediatrician can be an important voice in helping the parents \\nunderstand and meet the child’s needs (Table 26.1) before, \\nduring, and after the divorce. Children should be told of the \\nparents’ decision before the physical separation. The separation \\nshould be presented as a rational step in managing marital \\nconflict and should prepare the child for the changes that will \\noccur. Parents should be prepared to answer children’s questions, \\nand they should expect that the questions will be repeated over \\nthe ensuing months. Once parents have told children of the \\nseparation, it may be confusing to the child if parents continue \\nto live together and may raise false hopes that the parents will \\nnot divorce.\\nMany parents report feeling like their life did not stabilize \\nuntil 2-3 years or more after the divorce; for some the divorce \\nremains a painful issue 10 years later. The child’s emotional \\nadjustment to divorce is closely predicted by the parents’ adjust-\\nment. Consequently, parents should be encouraged to seek help \\nfor themselves if they are struggling emotionally after a divorce. \\nAlthough most children ultimately show good adjustment to \\ndivorce, some have significant acting-out behaviors or depression \\nthat requires referral to a mental health professional. Some \\nparents need the assistance of a mediator or family therapist \\nTABLE 26.1 General Recommendations for Pediatricians \\nto Help Children During Separation, Divorce, \\nor Death of a Close Relative\\nAcknowledge and provide support for grief that the parent/\\ncaregiver is experiencing.\\nHelp parent/caregiver consider child’s needs and validate his/her \\nfeelings.\\nEncourage parent/caregiver to maintain routines familiar to the \\nchild.\\nEncourage continued contact between child and his or her \\nfriends.\\nIf primary residence changes, the child should take transitional \\nobjects, familiar toys, and other important objects to the new \\nresidence.\\nMinimize frequent changes in caregivers, and for infants, keep \\nbrief the times spent away from primary caregiver.\\nHave parent/caregiver reassure the child that he or she will \\ncontinue to be cared for.\\nHave parent/caregiver reassure the child that he or she did not \\ncause the separation, divorce, or death (especially important in \\npreschool children).\\nEncourage parent/caregiver to create times or rituals that allow \\nthe child to discuss questions and feelings if the child wishes.\\nEncourage parental self-care.

It should be \\nexplained in simple and honest terms that are consistent with \\nthe family’s beliefs. The explanation should help the child to \\nunderstand that the dead person’s body stopped functioning \\nand that the dead person will not return. Preschool children \\nshould be reassured that nothing they did caused the individual \\nto die.

False or misleading \\ninformation should be avoided. Comparisons of death to sleep \\nmay contribute to sleep problems in the child.\\nThere are many possible reactions of children to the death of \\na parent or close relative. Sadness and a yearning to be with the \\ndead relative are common. Sometimes a child might express a \\nwish to die so that he or she can visit the dead relative, but a plan \\nor desire to commit suicide is uncommon and would necessitate \\nimmediate evaluation. A decline in academic functioning, lack \\nof enjoyment with previously preferred activities, and changes \\nin appetite and sleep can occur.

Seeing others express their grief \\nand sadness may help the child to express these feelings. Going \\nto the funeral helps prevent the child from having fears or \\nfantasies about what happened at the funeral. If the child is \\ngoing to attend the funeral, he or she should be informed of \\nwhat to expect. If a preschool-age child expresses a desire not \\nto attend the funeral, he or she should not be encouraged to \\nattend.

Buchanan |  M aria L. Marquez\\nCHAPTER 27 \\nDiet of the Normal Infant\\nProper nutrition in infancy is essential for normal growth, \\nresistance to infections, long-term adult health, and optimal \\nneurologic and cognitive development. Healthy nutrition is \\nespecially important during the first 6 months, a period of \\nexceptionally accelerated growth and high nutrient require-\\nments relative to body weight. Breast feeding is associated \\nwith a reduced risk of many diseases in infants, children, \\nand mothers (for more details visit http://www.nutrition \\n.gov).\\nBREAST FEEDING\\nHuman milk and breast feeding are the ideal and normative \\nstandards for infant feeding and nutrition. The American \\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends human milk as the \\nsole source of nutrition for the first 6 months of life, with \\ncontinued intake for the first year, and as long as desired \\nthereafter. Breast feeding has short- and long-term advantages \\nfor infant neurodevelopment. Pediatric health care providers \\nshould approach breast feeding at multiple levels (individual, \\ncommunity, social, and political). The goals of the U.S. Depart-\\nment of Health and Human Services “Healthy People 2020” \\ninclude 82% of infants with any breast feeding, 25.5% of infants \\nwith exclusive breast feeding for the first 6 months of life, and \\nlactation support at work of 38%. In collaboration with national \\nand global organizations, including the AAP , World Health \\nOrganization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund \\n(UNICEF), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\n(CDC), and the Joint Commission, hospitals are asked to \\npromote and facilitate breast feeding.\\nThe first 2 days of breast feeding, and perhaps the first hour \\nof life, may determine the success of breast feeding. The 2011 \\nrate of breast feeding initiation reported by the CDC for the \\ntotal U.S. population was 79%, which met the target of initiation \\nfor “Healthy People 2020”; however, breast feeding did not \\ncontinue as long as recommended (Fig. 27.1). In response, a \\nmultilevel approach has been implemented as described in the \\nfollowing: (1) the federal government is supporting hospitals \\nand health departments to improve the maternity health care \\npractices; (2) state and local governments help hospitals to \\nadapt standards to support breast feeding; (3) hospitals work \\ntoward the Baby-Friendly designation and work with health \\ncare providers and community members to work for hospital \\npolicies and create networks for supporting breast feeding \\nin the communities; (4) health care providers can help write \\nhospital policies to support breast feeding and counseling to \\nmothers, promoting continuation of breast feeding at home; \\nand (5) parents can ask questions about breast feeding and \\ntheir needs. There is greater emphasis to improve and stan-\\ndardize hospital practices with “Baby-Friendly” programs for \\nbreast feeding support, utilizing the “Ten Steps to Successful \\nBreastfeeding” recommendations by the UNICEF/WHO; in \\nthe United States 29% of the hospitals were “Baby Friendly” \\nin 2007 and 54% in 2013. The percentage of infants born in \\n“Baby-Friendly” hospitals increased from 1% in 2005 to 14%  \\nin 2015.\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services and the \\nCDC recognize that breast feeding offers infants, mothers, \\nand society compelling advantages in both industrialized and \\ndeveloping countries. Human-milk feeding decreases the inci-\\ndence and severity of diarrhea, respiratory illness, otitis media, \\nbacteremia, bacterial meningitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, \\nas documented by the Agency for Healthcare Research and \\nQuality (AHRQ).\\nMothers who breast feed experience both short- and long-\\nterm health benefits. Decreased risk of postpartum hemorrhages, \\nmore rapid uterine involution, longer period of amenorrhea, \\nand decreased postpartum depression have been observed. \\nSimilarly, there is an association between a long lactation \\nof 12-23 months (cumulative lactation of all pregnancies) \\nand a significant reduction of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, \\ncardiovascular disease, and diabetes in the mother. Cumulative \\nlactation of more than 12 months also correlates with reduced \\nrisk of ovarian and breast cancer.\\nFeeding preterm infants human milk has beneficial effects \\non their long-term neurodevelopment (IQ). Preterm breast \\nfed infants also have a lower readmission rate in the first \\nyear of life.\\nAdequacy of milk intake  can be assessed by voiding and \\nstooling patterns of the infant. A well-hydrated infant voids 6-8 \\ntimes a day. Each voiding should soak, not merely moisten, a \\ndiaper, and urine should be colorless. By 5-7 days, loose yellow \\nstools should be passed approximately 4 times a day. Rate of \\nweight gain provides the most objective indicator of adequate \\nmilk intake. Total weight loss after birth should not exceed \\n7%, and birth weight should be regained by 10 days. The mean \\nfeeding frequency during the early weeks postpartum is 8-12 \\ntimes per day. An infant may be adequately hydrated while \\nnot receiving enough milk to achieve adequate energy and \\nnutrient intake. Telephone follow-up is valuable during the \\ninterim between discharge and the first doctor visit to monitor \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Temporary pumping, which is well tolerated, may \\nbe needed. Meeting with a lactation consultant may help \\nminimize these problems and allow the successful continuation \\nof breast feeding.\\nIf a lactating woman reports fever, chills, and malaise, \\nmastitis should be considered. Treatment includes frequent \\nand complete emptying of the breast and antibiotics. Breast \\nfeeding usually should not be stopped because the mother’s \\nmastitis commonly has no adverse effects on the breast fed \\ninfant. Untreated mastitis may rarely progress to a breast \\nabscess. If an abscess is diagnosed, treatment includes incision \\nand drainage, antibiotics, and regular emptying of the breast. \\nNursing from the contralateral breast can be continued with a \\nhealthy infant. If maternal comfort allows, nursing can continue \\non the affected side.\\nMaternal infection with human immunodeficiency virus \\n(HIV) is considered a contraindication for breast feeding in \\ndeveloped countries. When the mother has active tuberculosis, \\nsyphilis, or varicella, restarting breast feeding may be considered \\nafter therapy is initiated. If a woman has herpetic lesions on \\nher breast, nursing and contact with the infant on that breast \\nshould be avoided. Women with genital herpes can breast feed. \\nProper handwashing procedures should be stressed.\\nThere are limited numbers of medical contraindications for \\nbreast feeding, including pediatric metabolic disorders such \\nas galactosemia and infants with phenylketonuria, although \\ninfants with the latter may alternate breast feeding with special \\nprotein-free or modified formulas. Maternal contraindications \\nare shown in Table 27.1.\\nMaternal Drug Use\\nAny drug prescribed therapeutically to newborns usually can \\nbe consumed via breast milk without ill effect. The factors that \\ndetermine the effects of maternal drug therapy on the nursing \\ninfant include the route of administration, dosage, molecular \\nweight, pH, and protein binding. Few therapeutic drugs are \\nabsolutely contraindicated; these include radioactive compounds, \\nantimetabolites, lithium, and certain antithyroid drugs. The \\nmother should be advised against the use of unprescribed drugs, \\nincluding alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, or “street drugs. ”\\nMaternal use of illicit or recreational drugs is a contraindica-\\ntion to breast feeding. If a woman is unable to discontinue \\ndrug use, she should not breast feed. Expression of milk for \\na feeding or two after use of a drug is not acceptable. Breast \\nfed infants of mothers taking methadone (but no alcohol or \\nother drugs) as part of a treatment program generally have not \\nexperienced ill effects.\\nFORMULA FEEDING\\nCow’s milk–based formulas are the vast majority of commercial \\nformulas. Most milk-based formulas have added iron, which \\nthe AAP recommends, and parents should use only iron-fortified \\nformula unless advised otherwise by the primary health care \\nprovider. Infant formula manufacturers have begun to examine \\nthe benefits of adding a variety of nutrients and biologic factors \\nto infant formula to mimic the composition and quality of \\nbreast milk. These include long-chain polyunsaturated fatty \\nthe progress of lactation. A follow-up visit should be scheduled \\nby 3-5 days of age and again by 2 weeks of age.\\nIn the newborn period, elevated concentrations of serum \\nbilirubin are present more often in breast fed infants than in \\nformula-fed infants (see Chapter 62). Feeding frequency during \\nthe first 3 days of life of breast fed infants is inversely related \\nto the level of bilirubin; frequent feedings stimulate meconium \\npassage and excretion of bilirubin in the stool. Infants who have \\ninsufficient milk intake and poor weight gain in the first week of \\nlife may have an increase in unconjugated bilirubin secondary \\nto an exaggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. This \\nis known as breast feeding jaundice. Attention should be \\ndirected toward improved milk production and intake. The \\nuse of water supplements in breast fed infants has no effect \\non bilirubin levels and is not recommended. After the first \\nweek of life in a breast fed infant, prolonged elevated serum \\nbilirubin may be due to the presence of an unknown factor in \\nmilk that enhances intestinal absorption of bilirubin. This is \\ntermed breast milk jaundice, which is a diagnosis of exclusion \\nand should be made only if an infant is otherwise thriving, \\nwith normal growth and no evidence of hemolysis, infection, \\nbiliary atresia, or metabolic disease (see Chapter 62). Breast \\nmilk jaundice usually lasts no more than 1-2 weeks. The AAP \\nrecommends vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/d ay starting \\nsoon after birth) for breast fed infants.\\nCommon Breast Feeding Problems\\nBreast tenderness, engorgement, and cracked nipples are the \\nmost common problems encountered by breast feeding \\nmothers. Engorgement, one of the most common causes of \\nlactation failure, should receive prompt attention because milk \\nsupply can decrease quickly if the breasts are not adequately \\nemptied. Applying warm or cold compresses to the breasts \\nbefore nursing and hand expression or pumping of some milk \\ncan provide relief to the mother and make the areola easier \\nto grasp by the infant. Nipple tenderness requires attention \\nto proper latch-on and positioning of the infant.

By this age, an exclusively breast fed infant \\nrequires additional sources of several nutrients, including protein, \\niron, and zinc. Cereals are commonly introduced around 6 months \\nof age, and initially they are mixed with breast milk, formula, \\nor water and later with fruits. By tradition solid cereals are usually \\nintroduced first; however, there is no medical evidence that a \\nparticular order is better than others for the infants. Baby-cereals \\nare available premixed or dry, to which parents add breast milk, \\nformula, or water. Single-grain iron-fortified cereals (rice, oatmeal, \\nbarley) are recommended as starting cereals to help identify \\npossible allergies or food intolerances that may arise, especially \\nwhen new foods and solids are added to the diet. Infants do not \\nneed juices, but if juice is given, it should be started only after \\n12 months of age, given in a cup (as opposed to a bottle), and \\nlimited to 4 o z (for toddlers age 1-3 yr) daily of 100% natural \\njuice, and it should be unsweetened; juices should also be offered \\nonly with meals or snacks. If these recommendations are not \\nfollowed, the infant may have reduced appetite for other more \\nnutritious foods, including breast milk and/or formula. Too much \\njuice may cause diaper rash, diarrhea, and weight gain. An infant \\nshould never be put to sleep with a bottle or sippy cup filled \\nwith milk, formula, or juice because this can result in early \\nchildhood caries (ECCs), formerly known as infant bottle tooth \\ndecay (see Chapter 127). For the first 2 months it is important \\nto set the stage for making a distinction between sleeping and \\nfeeding time. Healthy infants do not need extra water; breast \\nmilk and formula provide all the fluids needed. However, with \\nthe introduction of solid foods, water can be added to the infant’s \\ndiet. If the family lives in an area with fluoridated water, the \\nrecommendation is to provide infants the fluoridated water for \\npreventing future tooth decay.\\nDuring the 4-6 months of age, starting actively to separate \\nmealtime from bedtime is recommended. After 6 months of \\nage other foods may be introduced as the infant shows signs of \\nreadiness to solid feedings. Solid cereals are usually introduced \\nfirst. Once the infant learns to eat them, parents gradually \\nintroduce one food at a time, and they should wait 2-3 days \\nbefore introducing a new one and watch for signs of an allergic \\nreaction such as diarrhea, rash, or vomiting. In general meats \\nand vegetables have more nutrients per serving than fruits and \\ncereals. Green vegetables bring nutrients, vitamins, minerals, \\nand micronutrients.\\nThe avoidance of foods with high allergic potential in infancy \\n(e.g., fish, tree nuts, peanuts, dairy products, and eggs) is no \\nlonger supported, and early introduction may actually help to \\nprevent food allergies. Once the child can sit and bring her hands \\nor other objects to the mouth, parents may provide finger food \\nto help the infant learn to feed themselves. To avoid choking, \\nmake sure that anything given to the infant is easy to swallow, \\nsoft, and cut in very small pieces. Initially the infant should be \\neating approximately 4 ounces of solids at each daily meal. If \\nthe food fed to the infant is prepared by the adult, it should be \\nprepared without preservatives or high salt. All foods with the \\npotential to obstruct the young infant’s main airway should be \\navoided in general until 4 years of age or older. Honey (risk \\nof infant botulism) should not be given before 1 year of age. \\nCommercially prepared or homemade foods help meet the \\nnutritional needs of the infant. If the introduction of solid foods \\nis delayed, nutritional deficiencies can develop, and oral sensory  \\nacids, nucleotides, prebiotics, and probiotics. Soy-based formulas, \\nwhich sometimes have added iron, may be used for newborns \\nwho may be allergic to cow’s milk. However, some newborns \\nallergic to cow’s milk are also allergic to the protein in soy \\nformulas. There are hypoallergenic formulas for infants who \\ncannot tolerate the basic formulas, such as those with allergies \\nto milk or soy proteins. The proteins in these hypoallergenic \\nformulas are broken down to their basic components and are \\ntherefore easier to digest (Table 27.2). Specialized formulas are \\ndesigned for premature, low birth weight babies. The carbo-\\nhydrate in standard formulas is generally lactose, although \\nlactose-free cow’s milk–based formulas are available. The caloric \\ndensity of formulas is 20 k cal/oz (0.67  k cal/mL), similar to that \\nof human milk. A relatively high-fat and calorically dense diet \\n(human milk or formula) is needed to deliver adequate calories. \\nFormula-fed infants are at higher risk for obesity later in child-\\nhood; this may be related to self-regulation of volumes ingested \\nby the newborns and infants.\\nTABLE 27.1 Maternal Contraindications and \\nRecommendations for Breast Feeding\\nMATERNAL \\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR \\nMOTHER\\nTuberculosis (active) Should not breast feed; expressed \\nmilk may be provided to child.\\nVaricella Should not breast feed; expressed \\nmilk may be provided to child.\\nH1N1 influenza Should not breast feed; expressed \\nmilk may be provided to child. \\nAlternately provide prophylaxis to \\ninfant and continue nursing.\\nHerpes simplex infection of \\nthe breast\\nShould not breast feed; expressed \\nmilk may be provided to child.\\nHuman immunodeficiency \\nvirus\\nIn industrialized countries, mothers \\nare not recommended to breast \\nfeed.

Learning \\nhealthy eating behaviors at an early age is an important preven-\\ntive measure because of the association of diet with several \\nchronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular \\ndisease, which account for approximately 63% of all deaths \\nworldwide. These diseases share risk factors that can be modified \\nby lifestyle changes, such as eating less processed food and \\nincreasing physical activity. Diets high in fruits and vegetables \\ntogether with increased physical activity reduce metabolic risk \\nfactors. The first 1,000 days of life are an important time to \\nengage in healthy nutrition behaviors that will promote well-\\nbeing. Accelerated postnatal growth in infants and young \\nchildren is an important risk factor for obesity. New research \\nis focusing on the human intestinal microbiome starting at \\nbirth, suggesting that microbes and their products may function \\nas important modulators in the host immune system. Deviations \\nin the intestinal microbiome have been associated with various \\ndiseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, \\nand colorectal cancer.\\nMILK\\nThe consumption of cow’s milk is ideally not introduced until \\napproximately 1 year of age, when it is better tolerated. Low-fat \\n(2%) or whole milk is recommended until 2 years or age, after \\nwhich fat-free or 1% milk is recommended. Excessive milk \\nintake (more than 24  o z/day) should be avoided in toddlers \\nbecause larger intakes may reduce the intake of a good variety \\nof nutritionally important solid foods and also result in iron \\ndeficiency anemia; large intakes also may contribute to excessive \\ncaloric intake.\\nJUICES\\nJuice intake for toddlers and young children should be limited \\nto 4 o z, and juice intake for children 7-18 years of age should \\nbe limited to 8 o z/day. If juices are provided to children, they \\nshould be only natural fruit juices with no added sugar. “ Added \\nsugar” refers to sugar, fructose, and honey used in the processing \\nand preparation. Children younger than 2 years should not \\nhave any added sugars in their diet. Y oung people between the \\nages of 2 and 18 years should get no more than 25  g of added \\nsugar each day, according to the American Heart Association \\n(AHA). This amount of sugar is the equivalent of just six of \\nthe white sugar packets or six teaspoons of serving sugar. The \\ntypical American child consumes approximately triple the \\nrecommended amount of added sugars. Starting in July 2018, \\nfood products sold in the United States will have to list the \\namount of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts Panel. Water \\nand milk are the recommended drinks during the day. Excessive \\njuice with poorly digested carbohydrates may produce toddler \\ndiarrhea.\\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\\n“ChooseMyPlate” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture can \\nprovide parents with a general guideline for the types of foods \\nto be offered on a regular basis.

Supplemental iron is recommended if the child is \\niron deficient.\\nNUTRITION ISSUES FOR ADOLESCENTS\\nTeen nutrition can be a challenge. Ads for junk food and \\nimages of incredibly thin adolescents provide conflicting and \\nunhealthy ideas about what they should eat. Girls ages 14-18 \\nneed anywhere from 1,800-2,400 calories per day, depending on \\ntheir activity level and stage of development. Boys of the same \\nage group need 2,000-3,200 calories daily. Poor eating habits may \\ndevelop during adolescence. Skipped meals (especially breakfast), \\nbinge eating with friends or alone, dieting, and consumption of \\nnutrient-poor, calorically dense foods are common problems. \\nExcessive consumption of sugar from soda, fruit drinks, and \\nspecialty coffee and tea drinks may contribute to excess weight \\ngain, as well as tooth decay, and it may displace other needed \\nnutrients. Bones increase in size and mass during periods \\nof growth in childhood and adolescence; peak bone mass is \\nreached around age 30. The greater the peak bone mass, the \\nlonger one can delay serious bone loss with aging. Poor calcium \\nintake during adolescence may predispose the adult to future \\nosteoporotic hip fracture. Only 1 of 10 teenage girls and 1 \\nof 4 teenage boys get enough calcium every day. Adolescents \\nages 9-18 years need 1,300 m g of calcium daily. Good sources \\ninclude milk, yogurt, fortified orange juice, cheese, soybeans,  \\nand tofu.\\nInadequate iron intake may result in symptoms of fatigue \\nand iron deficiency anemia. Iron needs increase during growth \\nspurts, which is why teens are more likely to suffer from iron \\ndeficiency anemia. Teenage girls are especially prone to anemia \\nfrom menstrual blood loss. Student athletes are also vulnerable \\nto inadequate iron intakes, severely restrictive eating patterns, \\nand use of inappropriate nutritional and vitamin supplements. \\nAdolescents should be counseled on specific and healthy dietary \\nchoices (see Chapter 70).\\nCHAPTER 29 \\nObesity\\nDEFINITIONS\\nChildhood obesity is an epidemic in the United States. According \\nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in \\n1990, no state in the United States had a prevalence of obesity \\nof 15% or more, but by 2010, no state had a prevalence of \\nobesity less than 20% and a third of the states had a prevalence \\nof 30% or higher. More than one-third of adults (37.9% of the \\nU.S. population) are obese in the United States. Child and \\nadolescent obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) \\nat or above the gender-specific 95th percentile on the CDC \\nBMI-for-age growth charts. Childhood extreme obesity  was \\ndefined as a BMI at or above 120% of the gender-specific 95th \\npercentile on the CDC BMI-for-age growth chart. Child and \\nadolescent overweight was defined as a BMI between the 85th \\nand 95th percentile on the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. \\nChildhood obesity is associated with a higher risk of premature \\ndeath and disability in adulthood. Overweight and obese children \\nnuts, and legumes. Power struggles over eating are common \\nbetween parents and toddlers. The parent’s role is to decide \\nthe what, when, and where of the meals. The child’s role is to \\ndecide if, what, and how much to eat.\\nRecommendations of a nutritious diet for a child are based \\non the following nutrient-dense foods:\\n•\\tProtein. Provide seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans, \\npeas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds.\\n•\\t Fruits. Encourage the child to eat a variety of fresh, canned, \\nfrozen, or dried fruits—rather than fruit juice. If the child \\ndrinks juice, make sure it is 100% juice without added sugars \\nand limit his or her servings. Look for canned fruit that \\nsays it is light or packed in its own juice, meaning it is low \\nin added sugar. Keep in mind that one-half cup of dried \\nfruit counts as one cup-equivalent of fruit. When consumed \\nin excess, dried fruits can contribute to extra calories.\\n•\\t Vegetables. Serve a variety of fresh, canned, frozen, or dried \\nvegetables. Aim to provide a variety of vegetables, including \\ndark green, red, and orange, beans and peas, starchy and \\nothers, each week. When selecting canned or frozen vege-\\ntables, look for options lower in sodium.\\n•\\t Grains. Choose whole grains, such as whole-wheat bread, \\noatmeal, popcorn, quinoa, or brown or wild rice. Limit \\nrefined grains.\\n•\\t Dair y. Encourage the child to eat and drink fat-free or low-fat \\ndairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cheese, or fortified soy \\nbeverages.\\nAim to limit the child’s calories from:\\n•\\t Added sugar. Limit added sugars. Naturally occurring sugars, \\nsuch as those in fruit, veggies, grains, meat, and milk, are \\nnot added sugars. Examples of added sugars include serving \\nsugar, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, honey, and \\nothers.\\n•\\t Saturated and trans-fats. Limit saturated fats—fats that \\nmainly come from animal sources of food, such as red meat, \\npoultry, and full-fat dairy products. Look for ways to replace \\nsaturated fats with vegetable and nut oils, which provide \\nessential fatty acids and vitamin E. Healthier fats are also \\nnaturally present in olives, nuts, avocados, and seafood. Limit \\ntrans-fats by avoiding foods that contain partially hydroge-\\nnated oil.\\nSALT INTAKE\\nAmerican children’s high salt intake puts them at risk for heart \\ndisease later in life. Recommended salt intake for children varies \\nfrom 1,900-2,300 m g a day, depending on age. Nearly 90% of \\nU.S. kids consume more than the recommended amount of \\nsalt for their age. Sodium-heavy breads, pizza, cold cuts, \\nprocessed snacks, and soups are among the major culprits. \\nData in 2011–2012 showed that children ages 6-18 years \\nconsumed an average of 3,256 m g a day of salt, without including \\nthe salt added at the table.\\nIRON INTAKE\\nIron intake may be inadequate in some children between 1 \\nand 3 years of age in the United States. Significant iron deficiency \\nanemia exists in some high-risk minority or low-income \\npopulations of young children. Toddlers with excessive milk \\nintakes (>32 o z/day) and/or those who consume little meat, \\niron-rich green vegetables, or grains are at risk for iron \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Complications of obesity in children and \\nadolescents can affect every major organ system. High BMI \\nincreases the risk of metabolic and CVDs and some cancers; it is \\nalso the most important modifiable risk factor for hyperglycemia \\nand diabetes. Children who are obese are at higher risk for (1) \\nhigh blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors \\nfor CVD; (2) impaired glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, \\ntype 2 diabetes; (3) respiratory problems such as sleep apnea \\nand asthma; (4) joint problems and musculoskeletal discomfort; \\n(5) fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastroesophageal reflux; \\n(6) psychologic stress such as depression, behavioral problems, \\nand bullying issues at school; (7) low self-esteem and low \\nself-reported quality of life; and (8) impaired social, physical, \\nand emotional functioning. Children who are obese are more \\nlikely to become obese adults. Adult obesity is associated with \\na number of serious health conditions including heart disease, \\nmetabolic syndrome, and cancer. If children were obese, obesity \\nand these risk factors in adulthood are likely to be more severe. \\nThe history and physical examination should screen for many \\npotential complications noted among obese patients (Table \\n29.1) in addition to specific diseases associated with obesity \\n(Table 29.2). Medical complications usually are related to the \\ndegree of obesity and usually decrease in severity or resolve \\nwith weight reduction.\\nThe diagnosis of obesity depends on the measurement of \\nexcess body fat. Actual measurement of body composition is not \\npractical in most clinical situations. BMI may be an imperfect \\nmeasure of body fat and real health risk. There are racial and \\nethnic differences in body fat at the same BMI level. Among \\nchildren and adolescents, the definition of obesity is statistical. \\nChildren and adolescents are compared with a group of U.S. \\nchildren in the 1960s to early 1990s, so the prevalence of obesity \\nis dependent on the characteristics of the age-specific population \\nduring that period. BMI is a convenient screening tool that \\ncorrelates fairly strongly with body fatness in children and \\nadults. BMI age-specific and gender-specific percentile curves \\n(for 2-20 year olds) allow an assessment of BMI percentile \\nare more likely to stay obese into adulthood and to develop \\nnoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and \\ncardiovascular diseases (CVDs) at a younger age. For most \\nNCDs resulting from obesity, the risks depend partly on the \\nage of onset and on the duration of obesity. Obese children \\nand adolescents suffer from both short-term and long-term \\nhealth consequences.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nMany obese children become obese adults, and the risk of \\nremaining obese increases with age of onset and degree of \\nobesity. Obesity may run in families. The main causes of excess \\nweight in youth are similar to those in adults; they include \\nindividual causes such as behavior and rarely include genetics. \\nBehavior causes may include dietary patterns, physical activity, \\ninactivity, medication use, and other exposures. Obese children \\nmay exercise too little and consume too many calories. The \\nmost significant prevalence of obesity in race is in African-\\nAmerican (19.5%) and Hispanic children (21.9%). Individuals \\nwith lower income and/or education levels are disproportionally \\nmore likely to be obese. American society has become character-\\nized by an environment that promotes decreased consumption \\nof healthy food and physical inactivity. It is hard for children \\nto make the healthy decision when they are exposed to an \\nenvironment in their home, child care, school, or community \\nthat may not be ideally healthy and may be influenced by factors \\nsuch as advertising, variation in licensure regulations among \\nchild-care centers, lack of safe and appealing place to play or \\nbe active, limited access to healthy affordable foods, greater \\navailability of high-energy–dense foods and sugar sweetened \\nbeverages, increased portion sizes, and lack of breast feeding \\nsupport. One early major risk factor is maternal obesity during \\npregnancy. Children born to obese mothers are 3-5 times more \\nlikely to be obese in childhood. Children born to women before \\nand after bariatric surgery found that the children born after \\nthe surgery were at lower risk for obesity than the children \\nborn before the surgery. Women who gain much more weight \\nthan recommended during pregnancy have children who have \\na higher BMI than normal in adolescence. Small gestational \\nage (SGA) newborns have higher risks for abnormal postnatal \\nweight gain and diabetes; they may have long-lasting implications \\nfor health, which is possibly because of nutritional effects during \\nthe fetal life.\\nThe preventive strategies that are most likely to succeed in a \\nwide-scale population imply a set of very challenging goals of \\nreducing or plateauing the rise in overweight or obesity. These \\nstrategies include approaching all the risk factors that can be \\nmodified by lifestyle changes and policy making (see Table 29.3), \\nsuch as eating less processed food, increasing consumption  \\nof fruit and vegetables, and increasing physical activity.  \\nHigh BMI increases the risk of metabolic and CVDs and some \\ncancers; it is the most important modifiable risk factor for \\ndiabetes.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nTABLE 29.1 Complications of Obesity\\nCOMPLICATION EFFECTS\\nPsychosocial Peer discrimination, teasing, reduced college \\nacceptance, isolation, depression, eating \\ndisorders (binge eating), reduced job \\npromotion*\\nGrowth Advance bone age, increased height, early \\nmenarche\\nCentral nervous \\nsystem\\nPseudotumor cerebri\\nRespiratory Obstructive sleep apnea\\nCardiovascular Hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, \\nischemic heart disease,* sudden death*\\nOrthopedic Slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Blount \\ndisease\\nMetabolic Insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, \\nhypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, \\ngout,* hepatic steatosis, polycystic ovary \\ndisease, cholelithiasis\\n*Complications unusual until adulthood.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nObesity\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

However, if the environment con -\\ntributes to the unhealthy eating practices and sedentary lifestyle, \\nstrategies and interventions relying only on individual “self-\\ncontrol” will not be very effective. Children are less equipped \\nto make informed choices about what is healthy and what is \\nnot, making it imperative to concentrate on modifying the \\nenvironment. Prevention of childhood obesity on the other \\nhand can be more rewarding, providing better chances for \\nreducing long-term complications. There are three levels of \\nprevention in dealing with childhood obesity: (1) primordial \\nprevention as it deals with keeping a healthy weight and a \\nnormal BMI through childhood and into teens; (2) primary \\nprevention aiming to prevent overweight children from becom-\\ning obese; and (3) secondary prevention directed toward the \\ntreatment of obesity so as to reduce the co-morbidities and \\nreverse overweight and obesity if possible. The approach to \\ntherapy and aggressiveness of treatment should be based on \\nrisk factors including age, severity of overweight and obesity \\nand co-morbidities, and family history and support. The primary \\ngoal for all children with uncomplicated obesity and fast-rising \\nweight-for-height is to achieve a healthy balance of energy \\nconsumption as a caloric intake, healthy eating, with the \\nnumber of calories used with the activities and activity \\n(available online at http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts). Table 29.3 \\nprovides BMI interpretation guidelines. For children younger \\nthan 2 years of age, weight-for-length measurements greater than \\n95th percentile may indicate overweight and warrant further \\nassessment. Child and adolescent obesity was defined as a BMI \\nat or above the gender-specific 95th percentile on the CDC \\nBMI-for-age growth charts. A BMI for age and gender above \\nthe 95th percentile is strongly associated with excessive body \\nfat and co-morbidities. Extreme obesity was defined as a BMI \\nat or above 120% of the gender-specific 95th percentile on the \\nCDC BMI-for-age growth chart.\\nASSESSMENT\\nEarly recognition of excessive rates of weight gain, overweight, \\nor obesity in children is essential because the earlier the interven-\\ntions, the more likely they are to be successful.\\nRoutine evaluation at well child visits should include the \\nfollowing:\\n1. Anthropometric data, including weight, height, and calcula-\\ntion of BMI. Data should be plotted on age-appropriate and \\ngender-appropriate growth charts and assessed for BMI \\ntrends (see Table 29.3).\\n2. Dietary and physical activity history (Table 29.4). Assess \\npatterns and potential targets for behavioral change.\\n3. Physical examination. Assess blood pressure, adiposity \\ndistribution (central versus generalized), markers of co-\\nmorbidities (acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, hepatomegaly, \\northopedic abnormalities), and physical stigmata of a genetic \\nsyndrome (explains fewer than 5% of cases).\\n4. Laboratory studies. These are generally reserved for children \\nwho are obese (BMI >95th percentile), who have evidence \\nof co-morbidities, or both. All 9-11 year olds should be \\nscreened for high cholesterol levels. Other useful laboratory \\ntests may include hemoglobin A1c, fasting lipid profile, \\nfasting glucose levels, liver function tests, and thyroid func-\\ntion tests (if there is a faster increase in weight than height).\\nPREVENTION\\nObesity and its associated co-morbidities have emerged as a \\nmajor health problem. In fact, obese children are becoming \\naffected by diseases and health problems previously observed \\nonly in adults. The main reason to target childhood obesity is \\nthat many obese children have a high probability to become \\nan obese adult with all the short- and long-term co-morbidities, \\nand it is more challenging for adults to lose excess weight if \\nthey are obese. Prevention is the key to success for obesity \\ncontrol. Behavioral and lifestyle modifications are the primary \\nTABLE 29.3 Body Mass Index Interpretation\\nBMI/AGE PERCENTILE INTERPRETATION\\n<5th Underweight\\n5th-85th Normal\\n85th-95th Overweight\\n>95th Obese\\nBMI, Body mass index.\\nFrom www.cdc.gov/healthyweight.\\nTABLE 29.4 Eating and Activity Habits for Overweight/\\nObesity Prevention\\nACTIVITIES FOR OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY \\nPREVENTION\\nINDIVIDUAL 1.

Furthermore, advocate for specific \\nand attainable goal settings and positive reinforcement of target \\nbehavior. The traffic light diet may be useful in promoting \\nnutritional goals with the following categories: (1) green-GO \\nincludes foods that are low in calories and can be eaten without \\nany restrictions; (2) yellow-CAUTION includes food items with \\nmoderate to high calorie content that can be eaten only in \\nmoderation; and (3) Red-STOP includes high-calorie food items \\nthat should be avoided or eaten rarely. Physical activity is the \\nkey component for prevention and management of obesity. \\nPreschool children require unstructured activities and thus will \\nbenefit from outdoor play and games. On the other hand, school \\nchildren and adolescents require at least 60 minutes of daily \\nphysical activities, so instead of recommending a wide open \\nschedule to walk or bike to school more, suggest walking or \\nbiking to school two or more days a week. Rather than recom-\\nmending that a child watch less television, suggest watching \\nno television on school days. It is important to keep it simple \\nand set one or two short-term goals at a time. In addition, \\nbehavioral risk factors need to be identified, such as going to \\nget fast food when family life gets hectic. Helping the family \\nthink of fast, healthy alternatives is important.\\nAge-appropriate portion sizes for meals and snacks should \\nbe encouraged. Children should be taught to recognize hunger \\nand satiety cues, guided by reasonable portions and healthy \\nfood choices by parents. Smaller bowls should be used; children \\nshould never eat directly from a bag or box. No juices or soda \\nshould be the rule. Children should never be forced to eat when \\npatterns. For children with a secondary complication, improve-\\nment of the complication is an important goal. Childhood and \\nadolescent obesity treatment programs can lead to sustained \\nweight loss and decreases in BMI when treatment focuses on \\nbehavioral changes and is family centered. Concurrent changes \\nin dietary and physical activity patterns are most likely to provide \\nsuccess (Table 29.5). All of the previously mentioned strategies \\nshould be put into practice sequentially from the perinatal \\nperiod to adolescence. In the perinatal period this includes \\nadequate prenatal nutrition with optimal maternal weight gain, \\ngood blood sugar control in diabetes, and postpartum weight \\nloss with healthy nutrition and exercises. During infancy, early \\ninitiation of breast feeding, exclusive breast feeding for 6 months \\nfollowed by inclusion of solid foods, providing a balanced diet \\nwith avoidance of unhealthy calorie-rich snacks, and close \\nmonitoring of weight gain should be emphasized. The transition \\nto complementary and table foods and the importance of \\nregularly scheduled meals and snacks, versus grazing behavior, \\nshould be emphasized. During the preschool age period, putting \\nthese strategies into practice includes providing nutritional \\neducation and guidance to parents and children so as to develop \\nhealthy eating practices, offering healthy food preferences by \\ngiving early experiences of different food and flavors, and \\nfollowing closely the rate of weight gain to prevent early adiposity \\nrebound. In school-aged children, this includes monitoring \\nboth weight and height, preventing excessive prepubertal adipos-\\nity, providing nutritional counseling, and emphasizing daily \\nphysical activity should be emphasized.

Clinicians may need to help families \\nidentify alternatives to sedentary activities, especially for families \\nwith deterrents to activity, such as unsafe neighborhoods or \\nlack of supervision after school. Obesity is challenging to treat \\nand can cause significant medical and psychosocial issues for \\nyoung children and adolescents (see Table 29.1).\\nWe as a society need to ensure the convenient access to \\nhealthy food and safe places for physical activities. Preschools, \\nschools, clubs, and social gathering places need to curb available \\njunk food and sodas and provide healthy and nutritious foods \\nfor children and adolescents. Fast food restaurants need to \\ncontinue to offer healthy menu items and strive to reduce calories \\nand fat in all of the products they provide. Communities need \\nto work to provide playgrounds, sports activities, bike trails, \\nand other opportunities for physical activities for all children, \\nespecially those in certain ethnic groups known to be at the \\nhighest risk for obesity.\\nTREATMENT\\nMore aggressive therapies are considered only for those who \\nhave not responded to other interventions. The initial interven-\\ntions include a systematic approach that promotes multidisci-\\nplinary brief, office-based interventions for obese children and \\npromotes reducing weight. Before enrolling any patient in a \\nweight-loss program, the clinician must have a clear idea of \\nthat individual’s expectations. Patients with unrealistic expecta-\\ntions should not be enrolled until these are changed to realistic \\nand attainable goals. Using the pneumonic described, the clini-\\ncian should guide the patient who seeks weight reduction to \\ncreate SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, \\nand Timely.\\nPediatric experiences with drugs are limited. Anorectic \\ndrugs are not recommended for routine use, and the efficiency \\nand safety of these drugs have to be established by controlled \\nclinical trial.\\nIn the context of a general lack of effective tools for primary \\nprevention or behavioral treatment of obesity, surgical treatment \\nmay be advocated as a preferred and cost-effective solution for \\ncertain children and adolescents. However, the role of bariatric \\nsurgery in the treatment of obese children or adolescents is \\ncontroversial. The concerns about surgery to treat obesity in \\nyoung populations include whether or not surgery is cost-\\neffective, how to ensure healthy growth through to adulthood, \\nwhat support services are needed after surgery, compliance \\nwith the postoperative nutrition regimen, and attendance at \\nappointments for long-term follow-up and care. There is very \\nlimited evidence available to adequately estimate long-term \\nsafety, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, or durability of bariatric \\nsurgery in growing children. Although based on methodologi-\\ncally limited and underpowered studies, the existing evidence \\nsuggests that bariatric surgery in severely obese adolescents \\nresults in significant weight loss and improvements in co-\\nmorbidities and quality of life. Postoperative complications (both \\nphysical and psychological), compliance, and follow-up may \\nbe more problematic in adolescents than adults, and long-term \\ndata on safety, effectiveness, and cost remain largely unavailable.\\nCHAPTER 30 \\nPediatric Undernutrition\\nPediatric undernutrition is usually the result of inadequate food \\nsupply, access, or utilization; poor access to health and sanitation; \\nchronic health conditions; and/or inappropriate feeding or \\nchild-care practices. The greatest risk of undernutrition is in \\nutero through age 2 years. Various guidelines can be used to \\nclassify pediatric malnutrition (Table 30.1). International refer-\\nences are established that allow normalization of anthropometric \\nmeasures in terms of z scores. Other measurements include \\nheight and weight for age, weight for height, BMI, and mid-upper \\narm circumference. The greatest consequence of undernutrition \\nis death, but significant intellectual and physical disability exists \\nin many who survive.\\nProtein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a spectrum of condi-\\ntions caused by varying levels of protein and calorie deficiencies. \\nPrimary PEM is caused by social or economic factors that \\nresult in a lack of food. Secondary PEM occurs in children \\nwith various conditions associated with increased caloric \\nrequirements (infection, trauma, cancer; Fig. 30.1), increased \\ncaloric loss (malabsorption), reduced caloric intake (anorexia, \\ncancer, oral intake restriction, social factors), or a combination \\nof these three variables. Protein and calorie malnutrition may \\nbe associated with other nutrient deficiencies, which may be \\nevident on physical examination (Table 30.2).\\nFAILURE TO THRIVE\\nPediatric undernutrition in the United States is often termed \\nfailure to thrive and describes circumstances in which a child \\nfails to gain weight appropriately or, in more severe cases, \\nexperiences failure in linear growth or head circumference. \\nThe terms organic and nonorganic failure to thrive have lost \\nfavor in recognition of the frequent interplay between underly-\\ning medical conditions that may cause maladaptive behaviors. \\nSimilarly, social and behavioral factors that initially may have \\nbeen associated with feeding problems (see Chapter 21) and \\npoor growth may also be associated with medical problems, \\nincluding frequent minor acute illnesses.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFailure to Thrive\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Loss of muscle mass and \\nsubcutaneous fat stores can be confirmed by inspection or \\npalpation and quantified by anthropometric measurements. \\nThe head may appear large but generally is proportional to the \\nbody length. Edema usually is absent. The skin is dry and thin, \\nand the hair may be thin, sparse, and easily pulled out. Marasmic \\nchildren may be apathetic and weak and may be irritable when \\ntouched. Bradycardia and hypothermia signify severe and \\nlife-threatening malnutrition. Inappropriate or inadequate \\nweaning practices and chronic diarrhea are common findings \\nin developing countries. Stunting (impaired linear growth) \\nresults from a combination of malnutrition, especially micro-\\nnutrients, and recurrent infections.\\nKWASHIORKOR\\nKwashiorkor results from inadequate protein intake in the \\npresence of fair to good caloric intake. The hypoalbuminemic \\nstate results in pitting edema that starts in the lower extremities \\nand ascends with increasing severity. Other factors, such as \\nacute infection, toxins, and possibly specific micronutrient \\nor amino acid imbalances, are likely to contribute to the \\netiology. The major clinical manifestation  of kwashiorkor \\nis that the body weight is near normal for age; weight alone \\ndoes not accurately reflect the nutritional status because of \\nedema. Physical examination reveals a relative maintenance of \\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue and a marked atrophy of muscle \\nmass. Edema varies from a minor pitting of the dorsum of the \\nfoot to generalized edema with involvement of the eyelids and \\nscrotum. The hair is sparse, easily plucked, and appears dull \\nbrown, red, or yellow-white.

Environmental (social) deprivation \\nmay interact with the effects of the malnutrition to impair \\nfurther development and cognitive function.\\nCHAPTER 31 \\nVitamin and Mineral \\nDeficiencies\\nMicronutrients include vitamins and trace elements. In \\nindustrialized societies, frank clinical deficiencies are unusual \\nin healthy children, but they can and do occur in certain high-\\nrisk circumstances. Risk factors include diets that are consistently \\nlimited in variety (especially with the exclusion of entire food \\ngroups), malabsorption syndromes, and conditions causing \\nhigh physiologic requirements. Various common etiologies of \\nvitamin and nutrient deficiency states are highlighted in Table \\n31.1, and characteristics of vitamin deficiencies are outlined \\nin Table 31.2. Treatment is noted in Table 31.3.\\nWATER-SOLUBLE VITAMINS\\nWater-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body except for \\nvitamin B 12; intake therefore alters tissue levels. Absorption \\nfrom the diet is usually high, and the compounds exchange \\nreadily between intracellular and extracellular fluids; excretion \\nis via the urine. Water-soluble vitamins typically function as \\ncoenzymes in energy, protein, amino acid, and nucleic acid \\nmetabolism; as cosubstrates in enzymatic reactions; and as \\nstructural components.\\nAscorbic Acid\\nand advanced slowly to minimize these complications. The \\ninitial approach involves correction of dehydration and antiinfec-\\ntive (bacteria, parasites) therapy if indicated. Oral rehydration \\nis recommended over intravenous fluid to avoid excessive fluid \\nand solute load and resultant heart or renal failure.\\nWhen nutritional rehabilitation is initiated, calories can \\nbe safely started at 20% above the child’s recent intake. If \\nno estimate of the caloric intake is available, 50-75% of the \\nnormal energy requirement is safe. High-calorie oral solutions \\nor ready-to-use therapeutic foods (a mixture of powdered \\nmilk, peanuts, sugar, vitamins, and minerals) are frequently \\nused in developing countries. Nutritional rehabilitation can be \\ncomplicated by refeeding syndrome, which is characterized \\nby fluid retention, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and \\nhypokalemia. Careful monitoring of laboratory values and \\nclinical status with severe malnutrition is essential.\\nWhen nutritional rehabilitation has begun, caloric intake \\ncan be increased 10-20% per day, monitoring for electrolyte \\nimbalances, poor cardiac function, edema, or feeding intolerance. \\nIf any of these occurs, further caloric increases are not made \\nuntil the child’s status stabilizes. Caloric intake is increased until \\nappropriate regrowth or catch-up growth is initiated. Catch-up \\ngrowth refers to gaining weight at greater than 50th percentile \\nfor age and may require 150% or more of the recommended \\ncalories for an age-matched, well-nourished child. A general \\nrule of thumb for infants and children up to 3 years of age is to \\nprovide 100-120 k cal/kg based on ideal weight for height. Protein \\nneeds also are increased as anabolism begins and are provided in \\nproportion to the caloric intake. Vitamin and mineral intake in \\nexcess of the daily recommended intake is provided to account \\nfor the increased requirements; this is frequently accomplished \\nby giving an age-appropriate daily multiple vitamin with other \\nindividual micronutrient supplements as warranted by history, \\nphysical examination, or laboratory studies. Iron supplements \\nare not recommended during the acute rehabilitation phase, \\nespecially for children with kwashiorkor, for whom ferritin levels \\nare often high. Additional iron may pose an oxidative stress; \\niron supplementation at this time is associated with higher \\nmorbidity and mortality.\\nIn most cases, cow’s milk–based formulas are tolerated and \\nprovide an appropriate mix of nutrients. Other easily digested \\nfoods, appropriate for the age, also may be introduced slowly. \\nIf feeding intolerance occurs, lactose-free or semi-elemental \\nformulas should be considered.\\nCOMPLICATIONS OF MALNUTRITION\\nMalnourished children are more susceptible to infection, \\nespecially sepsis, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. Hypoglycemia \\nis common after periods of severe fasting but may also be a \\nsign of sepsis. Hypothermia may signify infection or, with \\nbradycardia, may signify a decreased metabolic rate to conserve \\nenergy. Bradycardia and poor cardiac output predispose the \\nmalnourished child to heart failure, which is exacerbated by \\nacute fluid or solute loads. Micronutrient deficiencies also \\ncan complicate malnutrition. Vitamin A and zinc deficiencies \\nare common in the developing world and are an important \\ncause of altered immune response and increased morbidity \\nand mortality. Depending on the age at onset and the duration \\nof the malnutrition, malnourished children may have permanent \\ngrowth stunting (from malnutrition in utero, infancy, or \\nadolescence) and delayed development (from malnutrition in \\nThe principal forms of vitamin C are ascorbic acid and the \\noxidized form, dehydroascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid acceler -\\nates hydroxylation reactions in many biosynthetic reactions, \\nincluding hydroxylation of proline in the formation of collagen. \\nThe needs of full-term infants for ascorbic acid and dehydro-\\nascorbic acid are calculated by estimating the availability in  \\nhuman milk.\\nA deficiency of ascorbic acid results in the clinical manifesta-\\ntion of scurvy . Infantile scurvy is manifested by irritability, \\nbone tenderness with swelling, and pseudoparalysis of the legs. \\nThe disease may occur if infants are fed unsupplemented cow’s \\nmilk in the first year of life or if the diet is devoid of fruits \\nand vegetables. Subperiosteal hemorrhage, bleeding gums and \\npetechiae, hyperkeratosis of hair follicles, and a succession of \\nmental changes characterize the progression of the illness. \\nAnemia secondary to bleeding, decreased iron absorption, or \\nabnormal folate metabolism are also seen in chronic scurvy. \\nTreatment is noted in Table 31.3.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAnemia\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Thiamine also is involved in the decarbox -\\nylation of branched-chain amino acids. Thiamine is lost during \\nmilk pasteurization and sterilization.\\nThiamine deficiency occurs in alcoholics and has been \\nreported in adolescents who have undergone bariatric surgery \\nfor severe obesity. Infantile beriberi  occurs between 1 and \\n4 months of age in breast fed infants whose mothers have a \\nthiamine deficiency (alcoholism), in infants with protein-calorie \\nmalnutrition, in infants receiving unsupplemented hyperali-\\nmentation fluid, and in infants receiving boiled milk. Acute \\nwet beriberi with cardiac symptoms and signs predominates \\nin infantile beriberi. Anorexia, apathy, vomiting, restlessness, \\nand pallor progress to dyspnea, cyanosis, and death from heart \\nfailure. Infants with beriberi have a characteristic aphonic cry; \\nthey appear to be crying, but no sound is uttered. Other signs \\ninclude peripheral neuropathy and paresthesias. For treatment \\nsee Table 31.3.\\nRiboflavin\\nVitamin B 2 is a constituent of two coenzymes, riboflavin \\n5′-phosphate and flavin-adenine dinucleotide, essential com-\\nponents of glutathione reductase and xanthine oxidase, which \\nare involved in electron transport. A deficiency of riboflavin \\naffects glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism. Riboflavin \\nand its phosphate are decomposed by exposure to light and by \\nstrong alkaline solutions.\\nAriboflavinosis is characterized by an angular stomatitis; \\nglossitis; cheilosis; seborrheic dermatitis around the nose and \\nmouth; and eye changes that include reduced tearing, photo-\\nphobia, corneal vascularization, and the formation of cataracts. \\nSubclinical riboflavin deficiencies have been found in diabetic \\nsubjects, children in families with low socioeconomic status, \\nchildren with chronic cardiac disease, and infants undergoing \\nprolonged phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia.\\nNiacin\\nNiacin consists of the compounds nicotinic acid and nicotin -\\namide (niacinamide). Nicotinamide, the predominant form of \\nthe vitamin, functions as a component of the coenzymes nico-\\ntinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine \\ndinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Niacin is involved in multiple \\nmetabolic processes, including fat synthesis, intracellular \\nrespiratory metabolism, and glycolysis.\\nIn determining the needs for niacin, the content of tryp-\\ntophan in the diet must be considered because tryptophan is \\nconverted to niacin. Niacin is stable in foods and withstands \\nheating and prolonged storage. Approximately 70% of the total \\nniacin equivalents in human milk are derived from tryptophan. \\nPellagra, or niacin deficiency disease, is characterized by weak-\\nness, lassitude, dermatitis, photosensitivity, inflammation of \\nmucous membranes, diarrhea, vomiting, dysphagia, and, in \\nsevere cases, dementia.\\nVitamin B6\\nVitamin B6 refers to three naturally occurring pyridines: pyri-\\ndoxine (pyridoxol), pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. The phosphates \\nof the latter two pyridines are metabolically and functionally \\nrelated and are converted in the liver to the coenzyme form, \\npyridoxal phosphate.

The cobalt ion is at the active \\ncenter of the ring and serves as the site for attachment of alkyl \\ngroups during their transfer. The vitamin functions in single-\\ncarbon transfers and is intimately related to folate function and \\ninterconversions. Vitamin B12 is essential for normal lipid and \\ncarbohydrate metabolism in energy production and in protein \\nbiosynthesis and nucleic acid synthesis.\\nIn contrast to other water-soluble vitamins, absorption of \\nvitamin B12 is complex, involving cleavage of the vitamin from \\ndietary protein and binding to a glycoprotein called intrinsic \\nfactor, which is secreted by the gastric mucosa (parietal cells). \\nThe cobalamin–intrinsic factor complex is efficiently absorbed \\nfrom the distal ileum.\\nAs vitamin B12 is absorbed into the portal circulation, it is \\ntransported bound to a specific protein, transcobalamin II. Its \\nlarge stores in the liver also are unusual for a water-soluble \\nvitamin. Efficient enterohepatic circulation normally protects \\nfrom deficiency for months to years. Dietary sources of the \\nvitamin are animal products only. Strict vegetarians should \\ntake a vitamin B12 supplement.\\nVitamin B12 deficiency in children is rare. Early diagnosis \\nand treatment of this disorder in childhood are important \\nbecause of the danger of irreversible neurologic damage. Most \\ncases in childhood result from a specific defect in absorption \\n(see Table 31.2). Such defects include congenital pernicious \\nanemia (absent intrinsic factor), juvenile pernicious anemia  \\n(autoimmune), and deficiency of transcobalamin II transport. \\nGastric or intestinal resection and small bowel bacterial over-\\ngrowth also cause vitamin B 12 deficiency. Exclusively breast \\nfed infants ingest adequate vitamin B12 unless the mother is a \\nstrict vegetarian without supplementation.\\nDepression of serum vitamin B 12 and the appearance of \\nhypersegmented neutrophils and macrocytosis (indistinguish-\\nable from folate deficiency) are early clinical manifestations \\nof deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency also causes neurologic \\nmanifestations, including depression, peripheral neuropathy, \\nposterior spinal column signs, dementia, and eventual coma. \\nThe neurologic signs do not occur in folate deficiency, but \\nadministration of folate may mask the hematologic signs of \\nvitamin B12 deficiency, while the neurologic manifestations \\nprogress. Patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency also have \\nincreased urine levels of methylmalonic acid. Most cases \\nof vitamin B12 deficiency in infants and children are not of \\ndietary origin and require treatment throughout life. Main-\\ntenance therapy consists of repeated monthly intramuscular \\ninjections, although a form of vitamin B12 is administered  \\nintranasally.\\nFAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS\\nFat-soluble vitamins generally have stores in the body, and \\ndietary deficiencies generally develop more slowly than for \\nwater-soluble vitamins. Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins \\ndepends on normal fat intake, digestion, and absorp-\\ntion. The complexity of normal fat absorption and the \\npotential for perturbation in many disease states explains \\nthe more common occurrence of deficiencies of these  \\nvitamins.\\nThe basic constituent of the vitamin A group is retinol. \\nIngested plant carotene or animal tissue retinol esters release \\nretinol after hydrolysis by pancreatic and intestinal enzymes. \\nChylomicron-transported retinol esters are stored in the liver \\nas retinol palmitate. Retinol is transported from the liver to \\ntarget tissues by retinol-binding protein, releasing free retinol \\nto the target tissues. The kidney then excretes the retinol-\\nbinding protein. Diseases of the kidney diminish excretion of \\nretinol-binding protein, whereas liver parenchymal disease or \\nmalnutrition lowers the synthesis of retinol-binding protein. \\nSpecific cellular binding proteins facilitate the uptake of retinol \\nby target tissues. In the eye, retinol is metabolized to form \\nrhodopsin; the action of light on rhodopsin is the first step \\nof the visual process. Retinol also influences the growth and \\ndifferentiation of epithelia. The clinical manifestations of \\nvitamin A deficiency in humans appear as a group of ocular \\nsigns termed xerophthalmia. The earliest symptom is night \\nblindness, which is followed by xerosis of the conjunctiva \\nand cornea. Untreated, xerophthalmia can result in ulceration, \\nnecrosis, keratomalacia, and a permanent corneal scar. Clini-\\ncal and subclinical vitamin A deficiencies are associated with \\nimmunodeficiency; increased risk of infection, especially \\nmeasles; and increased risk of mortality, especially in developing \\nnations. Xerophthalmia and vitamin A deficiency should be \\nurgently treated. Hypervitaminosis A also has serious sequelae, \\nincluding headaches, pseudotumor cerebri, hepatotoxicity, and  \\nteratogenicity.\\nVitamin E\\nEight naturally occurring compounds have vitamin E activity. \\nThe most active of these, α-tocopherol, accounts for 90% of \\nthe vitamin E present in human tissues and is commercially \\navailable as an acetate or succinate. Vitamin E acts as a biologic \\nantioxidant by inhibiting the peroxidation of polyunsaturated \\nfatty acids present in cell membranes. It scavenges free radicals \\ngenerated by the reduction of molecular oxygen and by the \\naction of oxidative enzymes.\\nVitamin E deficiency occurs in children with fat malab -\\nsorption secondary to liver disease, untreated celiac disease, \\ncystic fibrosis, and abetalipoproteinemia. In these children, \\nwithout vitamin E supplementation, a syndrome of pro-\\ngressive sensory and motor neuropathy  develops; the first \\nsign of deficiency is loss of deep tendon reflexes. Deficient \\npreterm infants at 1-2 months of age have hemolytic anemia \\ncharacterized by an elevated reticulocyte count, an increased \\nsensitivity of the erythrocytes to hemolysis in hydrogen per-\\noxide, peripheral edema, and thrombocytosis. All the abnor -\\nmalities are corrected after oral, lipid, or water-soluble vitamin  \\nE therapy.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHepatomegaly\\nHypercalcemia\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

When serum calcium levels decline to \\nless than 7.5 m g/dL, tetany may occur. Levels of 24,25-(OH)2-D \\nare undetectable, and serum 1,25-(OH)2-D levels are commonly \\nless than 7 n g/mL, although 1,25-(OH)2-D levels also may be \\nnormal. The best measure of vitamin D status is the level of \\n25-(OH)-D. Characteristic radiographic changes of the distal \\nulna and radius include widening; concave cupping; and frayed, \\npoorly demarcated ends. The increased space seen between the \\ndistal ends of the radius and ulna and the metacarpal bones is \\nthe enlarged, nonossified metaphysis.\\nBreast fed infants born of mothers with adequate vitamin \\nD stores usually maintain adequate serum vitamin D levels \\nfor at least 2 months, but rickets may develop subsequently \\nif these infants are not exposed to the sun or do not receive \\nsupplementary vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics \\nrecommends vitamin D supplementation of all breast fed infants \\nin the amount of 400 IU/d ay, started soon after birth and given \\nuntil the infant is taking more than 1,000  mL/d ay of formula \\nor vitamin D–fortified milk (for age >1 y r). Toxic effects of \\nexcessive chronic vitamin D may include hypercalcemia, muscle \\nweakness, polyuria, and nephrocalcinosis.\\nVitamin K\\nVitamin D\\nCholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) is the mammalian form \\nof vitamin D and is produced by ultraviolet irradiation of \\ninactive precursors in the skin. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is \\nderived from plants. Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 require further \\nmetabolism to become active. They are of equivalent potency. \\nClothing, lack of sunlight exposure, and skin pigmentation \\ndecrease generation of vitamin D in the epidermis and dermis.\\nVitamin D (D2 and D3) is metabolized in the liver to calcidiol, \\nor 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]-D); this metabolite, which \\nhas little intrinsic activity, is transported by a plasma-binding \\nglobulin to the kidney, where it is converted to the most \\nactive metabolite calcitriol, or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-\\n[OH]2-D). The action of 1,25-(OH) 2-D results in a decrease \\nin the concentration of messenger RNA (mRNA) for collagen \\nin bone and an increase in the concentration of mRNA for \\nvitamin D–dependent calcium-binding protein in the intestine \\n(directly mediating increased intestinal calcium transport). The \\nantirachitic action of vitamin D probably is mediated by provi-\\nsion of appropriate concentrations of calcium and phosphate \\nin the extracellular space of bone and by enhanced intestinal \\nabsorption of these minerals. Vitamin D also may have a direct \\nanabolic effect on bone. 1,25-(OH)2-D has direct feedback to \\nthe parathyroid gland and inhibits secretion of parathyroid \\nhormone.\\nVitamin D deficiency appears as rickets in children and as \\nosteomalacia in postpubertal adolescents. Inadequate direct \\nsun exposure and vitamin D intake are sufficient causes, but \\nother factors, such as various drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin) \\nand malabsorption, may increase the risk of development of \\nvitamin-deficiency rickets. Breast fed infants, especially those \\nwith dark-pigmented skin, are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.\\nThe pathophysiology of rickets results from defective bone \\ngrowth, especially at the epiphyseal cartilage matrix, which fails \\nto mineralize. The uncalcified osteoid results in a wide, irregular \\nzone of poorly supported tissue, the rachitic metaphysis. This \\nsoft, rather than hardened, zone produces many of the skeletal \\ndeformities through compression and lateral bulging or flaring \\nof the ends of bones.\\nThe clinical manifestations of rickets are most common \\nduring the first 2 years of life and may become evident only \\nafter several months of a vitamin D–deficient diet. Craniotabes \\nis caused by thinning of the outer table of the skull, which when \\ncompressed feels like a Ping-Pong ball to the touch. Enlargement \\nof the costochondral junction (rachitic rosary) and thickening \\nof the wrists and ankles may be palpated. The anterior fontanelle \\nis enlarged, and its closure may be delayed. In advanced rickets, \\nscoliosis and exaggerated lordosis may be present. Bowlegs or \\nknock-knees may be evident in older infants, and greenstick \\nfractures may be observed in long bones.\\nThe diagnosis of rickets is based on a history of poor vitamin \\nD intake and little exposure to direct ultraviolet sunlight. The \\nserum calcium usually is normal but may be low; the serum \\nThe plant form of vitamin K is phylloquinone, or vitamin \\nK1. Another form is menaquinone, or vitamin K 2, one of a \\nseries of compounds with unsaturated side chains synthesized \\nby intestinal bacteria. Plasma factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, \\nand X in the cascade of blood coagulation factors depend on \\nvitamin K for synthesis and for posttranslational conversion \\nof their precursor proteins. The posttranslational conversion \\nof glutamyl residues to carboxyglutamic acid residues of a \\nprothrombin molecule creates effective calcium-binding sites, \\nmaking the protein active.\\nOther vitamin K–dependent proteins include proteins C, S, \\nand Z in plasma and γ-carboxyglutamic acid–containing proteins \\nin several tissues. Bone contains a major vitamin K–dependent \\nprotein, osteocalcin, and lesser amounts of other glutamic \\nacid–containing proteins.\\nPhylloquinone is absorbed from the intestine and transported \\nby chylomicrons. The rarity of dietary vitamin K deficiency \\nin humans with normal intestinal function suggests that the \\nabsorption of menaquinones is possible. Vitamin K deficiency \\nhas been observed in subjects with impaired fat absorption \\ncaused by obstructive jaundice, pancreatic insufficiency, and \\nceliac disease; often these problems are combined with the use \\nof antibiotics that change intestinal flora.\\nHemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a disease more \\ncommon among breast fed infants, occurs in the first few weeks \\nof life. It is rare in infants who receive prophylactic intramus-\\ncular vitamin K on the first day of life.

Ten trace \\nminerals, which constitute less than 0.1% of body weight, have \\nessential physiologic roles. Characteristics of trace mineral \\ndeficiencies are listed in Table 31.4.\\nCalcium\\nCalcium is the most abundant major mineral. Ninety-nine \\npercent of calcium is in the skeleton; the remaining 1% is in \\nextracellular fluids, intracellular compartments, and cell mem-\\nbranes. The nonskeletal calcium has a role in nerve conduction, \\nmuscle contraction, blood clotting, and membrane permeability. \\nThere are two distinct bone calcium phosphate pools—a large, \\ncrystalline form and a smaller, amorphous phase. Bone calcium \\nconstantly turns over, with concurrent bone reabsorption and \\nformation. Approximately half of bone mineral accretion  \\noccurs during adolescence. Bone mineral density peaks in early \\nadulthood and is influenced by prior and concurrent dietary \\ncalcium intake, exercise, and hormone status (testosterone,  \\nestrogen).\\nCalcium intake can come from a variety of sources, with \\ndairy products providing the most common and concentrated \\nsource. The calcium equivalent of 1 cup of milk (about 300 m g \\nof calcium) is 3\\n4  cup of plain yogurt, 1.5 o z of cheddar cheese, 2 \\ncups of ice cream, 4 5  cup of almonds, or 2.5 o z of sardines. Other \\nsources of calcium include some leafy green vegetables (broccoli, \\nkale, collards); lime-processed tortillas; calcium-precipitated \\ntofu; and calcium-fortified juices, cereals, and breads.\\nThere is no classic calcium deficiency syndrome because \\nblood and cell levels are closely regulated.

Iron deficiency \\naffects many tissues (muscle and central nervous system) in \\naddition to producing anemia. Iron deficiency and anemia have \\nbeen associated with lethargy and decreased work capacity and \\nimpaired neurocognitive development, the deficits of which \\nmay be irreversible when onset is in the first 2 years of life.\\nThe diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is established by \\nthe presence of a microcytic hypochromic anemia, low serum \\nferritin levels, low serum iron levels, reduced transferrin satura-\\ntion, normal to elevated red blood cell width distribution, and \\nenhanced iron-binding capacity. The mean corpuscular volume \\nand red blood cell indices are reduced, and the reticulocyte \\ncount is low. Iron deficiency may be present without anemia. \\nClinical manifestations are noted in Table 31.4.\\nTreatment of iron deficiency anemia includes changes in \\nthe diet to provide adequate iron and the administration of \\n3–6 m g iron/kg per 24 hours (as ferrous sulfate) divided tid. \\nReticulocytosis is noted within 3-7 days of starting treatment. \\nOral treatment should be continued for 5 months. Rarely, \\nintravenous iron therapy is needed if oral iron cannot be given. \\nParenteral therapy carries the risk of anaphylaxis and should be \\nadministered according to a strict protocol, including a test dose.\\nZinc\\nNo adverse effects are observed in adults with dietary calcium \\nintakes of 2.5 g/d ay. There is concern that higher intakes may \\nincrease the risk of urinary stone formation, constipation, and \\ndecreased renal function and may inhibit intestinal absorption \\nof other minerals (iron, zinc).\\nIron\\nIron, the most abundant trace mineral, is used in the synthesis \\nof hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzyme iron. Body iron content \\nis regulated primarily through modulation of iron absorption, \\nwhich depends on the state of body iron stores, the form and \\namount of iron in foods, and the mixture of foods in the diet. \\nThere are two categories of iron in food. The first is heme iron, \\npresent in hemoglobin and myoglobin, which is supplied by \\nmeat and rarely accounts for more than one fourth of the iron \\ningested by infants. The absorption of heme iron is relatively \\nefficient and is not influenced by other constituents of the diet. \\nThe second category is nonheme iron, which represents the \\npreponderance of iron intake consumed by infants and exists \\nin the form of iron salts. The absorption of nonheme iron is \\ninfluenced by the composition of consumed foods. Enhancers \\nof nonheme iron absorption are ascorbic acid, meat, fish, and \\npoultry. Inhibitors are bran, polyphenols (including the tannates \\nin tea), and phytic acid, a compound found in legumes and \\nwhole grains. The percent intestinal absorption of the small \\namount of iron in human milk is 10%; 4% is absorbed from \\niron-fortified cow’s milk formula and from iron-fortified infant \\ndry cereals.\\nIn a normal term infant, there is little change in total body \\niron and little need for exogenous iron before 4 months of \\nage. Iron deficiency is rare in term infants during the first \\n4 months, unless there has been substantial blood loss (see \\nChapter 62). After about 4 months of age, iron reserves become \\nmarginal, and, unless exogenous sources of iron are provided, \\nthe infant becomes progressively at risk for anemia as the iron \\nrequirement to support erythropoiesis and growth increases \\n(see Chapter 150). Premature or low birth weight infants have \\na lower amount of stored iron because significant amounts of \\niron are transferred from the mother in the third trimester. In \\naddition, their postnatal iron needs are greater because of rapid \\nrates of growth and when frequent phlebotomy occurs. Iron \\nneeds can be met by supplementation (ferrous sulfate) or by iron-\\ncontaining complementary foods. Under normal circumstances, \\niron-fortified formula should be the only alternative to breast \\nmilk in infants younger than 1 year of age. Premature infants \\nfed human milk may develop iron deficiency anemia earlier \\nunless they receive iron supplements. Formula-fed preterm \\ninfants should receive iron-fortified formula.\\nIn older children, iron deficiency may result from inadequate \\niron intake with excessive cow’s milk intake or from intake of \\nfoods with poor iron bioavailability. Iron deficiency also can \\nresult from blood loss from such sources as menses, gastric \\nZinc is the second most abundant trace mineral and is \\nimportant in protein metabolism and synthesis, in nucleic \\nacid metabolism, and in stabilization of cell membranes. Zinc \\nfunctions as a cofactor for more than 200 enzymes and is \\nessential to numerous cellular metabolic functions. Adequate \\nzinc status is especially crucial during periods of growth and \\nfor tissue proliferation (immune system, wound healing, skin, \\nand gastrointestinal tract integrity); physiologic functions for \\nwhich zinc is essential include normal growth, sexual maturation, \\nand immune function.\\nDietary zinc is absorbed (20-40%) in the duodenum and \\nproximal small intestine. The best dietary sources of zinc are \\nanimal products, including human milk, from which it is readily \\nabsorbed. Whole grains and legumes also contain moderate \\namounts of zinc, but phytic acid inhibits absorption from these \\nsources. On a global basis, poor bioavailability secondary to \\nphytic acid is thought to be a more important factor than low \\nintake in the widespread occurrence of zinc deficiency. Excretion \\nof zinc occurs from the gastrointestinal tract. In the presence \\nof ongoing losses, such as in chronic diarrhea, requirements \\ncan drastically increase.\\nZinc deficiency dwarfism syndrome was first described in a \\ngroup of children in the Middle East with low levels of zinc in \\ntheir hair, poor appetite, diminished taste acuity, hypogonadism, \\nand short stature. Zinc supplementation reduces morbidity and \\nmortality from diarrhea and pneumonia and enhances growth \\nin developing countries.

Mild zinc \\ndeficiency occurs in older breast fed infants without adequate \\nzinc intake from complementary foods or in young children \\nwith poor total or bioavailable zinc intake in the general diet. \\nA high infectious burden also may increase the risk of zinc \\ndeficiency in developing countries. Acute, acquired severe zinc \\ndeficiency occurs in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition \\nwithout zinc supplementation and in premature infants fed \\nhuman milk without fortification. Clinical manifestations of \\nmild zinc deficiency include anorexia, growth faltering, and \\nimmune impairment. Moderately severe manifestations include \\ndelayed sexual maturation, rough skin, and hepatosplenomegaly. \\nThe signs of severe deficiency include acral and periorificial \\nerythematous, scaling dermatitis; growth and immune impair-\\nment; diarrhea; mood changes; alopecia; night blindness; and \\nphotophobia.\\nDiagnosis of zinc deficiency is challenging. Plasma zinc \\nconcentration is most commonly used, but levels are frequently \\nnormal in conditions of mild deficiency; levels in moderate \\nto severe deficiency are typically less than 60  µg/dL. Acute \\ninfection also can result in depression of circulating zinc levels. \\nThe standard for the diagnosis of deficiency is response to \\na trial of supplementation, with outcomes such as improved \\nlinear growth or weight gain, improved appetite, and improved \\nimmune function. Because there is no pharmacologic effect of \\nzinc on these functions, a positive response to supplementation \\nis considered evidence of a preexisting deficiency. Clinically an \\nempirical trial of zinc supplementation (1  µg/kg per day) is a \\nsafe and reasonable approach in situations in which deficiency \\nis considered possible.\\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive \\ndisorder that begins within 2-4 weeks after infants have been \\nweaned from breast milk. It is characterized by an acute perioral \\nand perianal dermatitis, alopecia, and failure to thrive. The \\ndisease is caused by severe zinc deficiency from a specific \\ndefect of intestinal zinc absorption. Plasma zinc levels are \\nmarkedly reduced, and serum alkaline phosphatase activity \\nis low. Treatment is with high-dose oral zinc supplements. A \\nrelatively uncommon condition associated with presentation \\nof severe zinc deficiency is due to a defect in the secretion of \\nzinc from the mammary gland, resulting in abnormally low \\nmilk zinc concentrations. Breast fed infants, especially those \\nborn prematurely, present with classic signs of zinc deficiency: \\ngrowth failure, diarrhea, and dermatitis. Because there is no \\ndefect in the infant’s ability to absorb zinc, treatment consists \\nof supplementing the infant with zinc for the duration of breast \\nfeeding, which can be successfully continued. Subsequent infants \\nborn to the mother will also need zinc supplementation if breast \\nfed. Zinc is relatively nontoxic.

Karp |  L arry A. Greenbaum\\nCHAPTER 32 \\nMaintenance Fluid Therapy\\nBODY COMPOSITION\\nWater is the most plentiful constituent of the human body. \\nTotal body water (TBW) as a percentage of body weight varies \\nwith age. The fetus has a high TBW , which gradually decreases \\nto about 75% of birth weight for a term infant; TBW is higher \\nin premature infants. During the first year of life, TBW decreases \\nto about 60% of body weight and basically remains at this level \\nuntil puberty. At puberty, the fat content of females increases \\nmore than that of males, who acquire more muscle mass than \\nfemales. Because fat has low water content and muscle has high \\nwater content, by the end of puberty, TBW in males remains \\nat 60%, but it decreases to 50% of body weight in females. \\nDuring dehydration, TBW decreases and is a smaller percentage \\nof body weight.\\nTBW has two main compartments: intracellular fluid (ICF) \\nand extracellular fluid (ECF). In the fetus and newborn, the \\nECF volume is larger than the ICF volume. The normal postnatal \\ndiuresis causes an immediate decrease in the ECF volume. This \\ndecrease in ECF volume is followed by continued expansion of \\nthe ICF volume because of cellular growth. By 1 year of age, \\nthe ratio of the ICF volume to the ECF volume approaches \\nadult levels. The ECF volume is 20-25% of body weight, and \\nthe ICF volume is 30-40% of body weight (Fig. 32.1). With \\npuberty, the increased muscle mass of males results in a higher \\nICF volume than in females.\\nThe ECF is divided further into plasma water and interstitial \\nfluid (see Fig. 32.1). Plasma water is about 5% of body weight. \\nThe blood volume, given a hematocrit of 40%, is usually 8% \\nof body weight, although it is higher in newborns and young \\ninfants. The interstitial fluid, normally 15% of body weight, \\ncan increase dramatically in diseases associated with edema, \\nsuch as heart failure, protein-losing enteropathy, liver failure, \\nand nephrotic syndrome.\\nThe composition of solutes in the ICF and ECF is different. \\nSodium and chloride are the dominant cation and anion in the \\nECF . Potassium is the most abundant cation in the ICF , and \\nproteins, organic anions, and phosphate are the most plentiful \\nanions in the ICF . The dissimilarity between the anions in the \\nICF and the ECF is determined largely by the presence of \\nintracellular molecules that do not cross the cell membrane, the \\nbarrier separating the ECF and the ICF . In contrast, the difference \\nin the distribution of cations—sodium and potassium—is due \\nto the activity of the Na +,K+-ATPase pump, which extrudes \\nsodium from cells in exchange for potassium.\\nREGULATION OF INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME \\nAND OSMOLALITY\\nProper cell functioning requires close regulation of plasma \\nosmolality and intravascular volume; these are controlled by \\nindependent systems for water balance which determines \\nosmolality, and sodium balance which determines volume status. \\nMaintenance of a normal osmolality depends on control of \\nwater balance. Control of volume status depends on regulation \\nof sodium balance.\\nThe plasma osmolality is tightly controlled between 285 and \\n295 mO sm/kg through regulation of water intake and urinary \\nwater losses. A small increase in the plasma osmolality stimulates \\nthirst. Urinary water losses are regulated by the secretion of \\nantidiuretic hormone (ADH), which increases in response to an \\nincreasing plasma osmolality. ADH, by stimulating renal tubular \\nreabsorption of water, decreases urinary water losses. Control \\nof osmolality is subordinate to maintenance of an adequate \\nintravascular volume. When significant volume depletion is \\npresent, ADH secretion and thirst are stimulated, regardless \\nof the plasma osmolality.\\nVolume depletion and volume overload may cause significant \\nmorbidity and mortality. Because sodium is the principal \\nextracellular cation and is restricted to the ECF , adequate body \\nsodium is necessary for maintenance of intravascular volume. \\nThe kidney determines sodium balance because there is little \\nhomeostatic control of sodium intake, although salt craving \\noccasionally occurs, typically in children with chronic renal \\nsalt loss or adrenal insufficiency. The kidney regulates sodium \\nbalance by altering the percentage of filtered sodium that is \\nreabsorbed along the nephron. The renin-angiotensin system \\nis an important regulator of renal sodium reabsorption and \\nexcretion. The juxtaglomerular apparatus produces renin in \\nresponse to decreased effective intravascular volume. Renin \\ncleaves angiotensinogen, producing angiotensin I, which \\nangiotensin-converting enzyme converts into angiotensin II. \\nThe actions of angiotensin II include direct stimulation of the \\nproximal tubule to increase sodium reabsorption and stimula-\\ntion of the adrenal gland to increase aldosterone secretion, \\nwhich increases sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. \\nIn contrast, volume expansion stimulates the synthesis of \\natrial natriuretic peptide, which increases urinary sodium  \\nexcretion.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Sweating is not insensible and, in contrast to evaporative \\nlosses, sweat contains water and electrolytes.\\nA variety of clinical situations modify normal maintenance \\nwater balance (Table 33.2). Evaporative skin water losses can be \\nhigher in neonates, especially premature infants who are under \\nradiant warmers or undergoing phototherapy. Burns can result \\nin massive losses of water and electrolytes (see Chapter 44). \\nFever increases insensible losses.

Placing the anuric child on “insensibles” theoretically \\nmaintains an even fluid balance, with the caveat that one third \\nof maintenance fluid is only an estimate of insensible losses. \\nThis rate may need to be adjusted based on monitoring of \\nthe patient’s weight and hydration status. An oliguric child \\nneeds to receive a urine replacement solution. Most children \\nwith polyuria (except for children with diabetes mellitus [see \\nChapter 171]) should be placed on insensible fluids plus urine \\nreplacement.\\nOutput from surgical drains and chest tubes, when significant, \\nshould be measured and replaced. Third space losses manifest \\nwith edema and ascites and are due to a shift of fluid from \\nthe intravascular space into the interstitial space. Third space \\nlosses cannot be quantitated. Nonetheless, these losses can be \\nlarge and lead to intravascular volume depletion, despite weight \\ngain from edema or ascites. Replacement of third space fluid is \\nempirical but should be anticipated in patients who are at risk, \\nsuch as children who have sepsis, shock, burns, or abdominal \\nsurgery. Third space losses and chest tube output are isotonic \\nand usually require replacement with an isotonic fluid, such \\nas normal saline (NS) or Ringer lactate.

The first step in caring for a dehydrated child is \\nto assess the degree of dehydration. The degree of dehydra-\\ntion dictates the urgency of the situation and the volume \\nof fluid needed for rehydration. Table 33.5 summarizes the \\nclinical features that are present with varying degrees of  \\ndehydration.\\nA patient with mild dehydration has few clinical signs \\nor symptoms. The history may describe decreased intake but \\nmore often increased fluid losses. An infant with moderate \\ndehydration has demonstrable physical signs and symptoms. \\nThe patient needs fairly prompt intervention. A patient with \\nsevere dehydration is gravely ill. The decrease in blood pressure \\nindicates that vital organs may be receiving inadequate perfu-\\nsion (shock) (see Chapter 40). Such a patient should receive \\nimmediate and aggressive intravenous (IV) therapy. Clinical \\nassessment of dehydration is only an estimate; the patient \\nmust be continually re-evaluated during therapy.

This resuscitation phase requires rapid restoration of the \\ncirculating intravascular volume, which should be done with \\nan isotonic solution, such as NS or Ringer lactate. Blood is \\nan appropriate fluid choice for a child with acute blood loss \\nbut is not always available at the start of fluid resuscitation. \\nThe child is given a fluid bolus, usually 20  mL/kg o f the \\nisotonic solution, over about 20 minutes. A child with severe \\ndehydration may require multiple fluid boluses and may need \\nto receive fluid at a faster rate. The initial resuscitation and \\nrehydration is complete when signs of intravascular volume \\ndepletion resolve. The child typically becomes more alert and \\nhas a lower heart rate, normal blood pressure, and improved  \\nperfusion.\\nWith adequate intravascular volume, it is now appropriate \\nto plan the fluid therapy for the next 24 hours (Table 33.6). \\nTo ensure that the intravascular volume is restored, the patient \\nreceives an additional 20 mL/kg b olus of isotonic fluid over 2 \\nhours. The child’s total fluid needs are added together (main -\\ntenance + deficit). The volume of isotonic fluids the patient has \\nreceived as acute resuscitation is subtracted from this total. The \\nremaining fluid volume is then administered over 24 hours. \\nPotassium usually is not included in the IV fluids until the \\npatient voids, unless significant hypokalemia is present. Children \\nwith significant ongoing losses need to receive an appropriate \\nreplacement solution.\\nintracellular space to the extracellular space helps to preserve \\nthe intravascular volume.\\nLaboratory Evaluation\\nSerum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations \\nare useful in assessing a child with dehydration. Volume deple-\\ntion without renal insufficiency may cause a disproportionate \\nincrease in the BUN, with little or no change in the creatinine \\nconcentration. This is secondary to increased passive reabsorp-\\ntion of urea in the proximal tubule caused by appropriate renal \\nconservation of sodium and water. This increase in the BUN \\nmay be absent or blunted in a child with poor protein intake \\nbecause urea production depends on protein degradation. \\nConversely, the BUN may be disproportionately increased in \\na child with increased urea production, as occurs in a child \\nwith a gastrointestinal bleed or a child who is receiving glu-\\ncocorticoids. A significant elevation of the creatinine concentra-\\ntion suggests renal injury.\\nThe urine specific gravity is usually elevated (≥1.025) in cases \\nof significant dehydration but decreases after rehydration. With \\ndehydration, a urinalysis may show hyaline and granular casts, \\na few white blood cells and red blood cells, and 30-100  m g/\\ndL of proteinuria. These findings usually are not associated \\nwith significant renal pathology, and they remit with therapy. \\nHemoconcentration from dehydration increases the hematocrit \\nand hemoglobin.\\nCalculation of Fluid Deficit\\nA child with dehydration has lost water; there is usually a \\nconcurrent loss of sodium and potassium.

Hypernatremia may cause fever, hypertonicity, \\nhyperreflexia, and seizures. More severe neurological symptoms \\nmay develop if cerebral bleeding or dural sinus thrombosis \\noccurs.\\nOverly rapid treatment of hypernatremic dehydration may \\ncause significant morbidity and mortality. Idiogenic osmoles \\nare generated within the brain during the development of \\nhypernatremia. Idiogenic osmoles increase the osmolality within \\nthe cells of the brain, providing protection against brain cell \\nshrinkage secondary to movement of water out of cells into \\nthe hypertonic extracellular fluid. These idiogenic osmoles dis-\\nsipate slowly during correction of hypernatremia. With rapid \\nlowering of the extracellular osmolality during correction of \\nhypernatremia, a new gradient may be created that causes water \\nmovement from the extracellular space into the cells of the \\nbrain, producing cerebral edema. Possible manifestations of \\nthe resultant cerebral edema include headache, altered mental \\nstatus, seizures, and potentially lethal brain herniation.\\nTo minimize the risk of cerebral edema during correction of \\nhypernatremic dehydration, the serum sodium concentration \\nshould not decrease more than 12 m Eq/L every 24 hours (Fig. \\n33.1). The choice and rate of fluid replacement are not nearly as \\nimportant as vigilant monitoring of the serum sodium concentra-\\ntion and adjustment of the therapy based on the result (see Fig. \\n33.1). Nonetheless, the initial resuscitation-rehydration phase \\nof therapy remains the same as for other types of dehydration.\\nOral Rehydration\\nMild to moderate dehydration from diarrhea of any cause can \\nbe treated effectively using a simple, oral rehydration solution \\n(ORS) containing glucose and electrolytes (see Chapter 112). \\nThe ORS relies on the coupled transport of sodium and glucose \\nin the intestine. Oral rehydration therapy has significantly \\nreduced the morbidity and mortality from acute diarrhea but \\nis underused in developed countries. It should be attempted \\nfor most patients with mild to moderate diarrheal dehydration. \\nOral rehydration therapy is less expensive than IV therapy and \\nhas a lower complication rate. IV therapy may still be required \\nfor patients with severe dehydration; patients with uncontrollable \\nvomiting; patients unable to drink because of extreme fatigue, \\nstupor, or coma; or patients with gastric or intestinal distention. \\nRapidly absorbed ondansetron may be used to treat vomiting, \\nthus facilitating oral rehydration.\\nAs a guideline for oral rehydration, 50  mL/kg of the ORS \\nshould be given within 4 hours to patients with mild dehydration, \\nand 100 mL/kg should be given over 4 hours to patients with \\nmoderate dehydration. Supplementary ORS is given to replace \\nongoing losses from diarrhea or emesis. An additional 10 mL/kg  \\nof ORS is given for each stool. Fluid intake should be decreased \\nif the patient appears fully hydrated earlier than expected or \\ndevelops periorbital edema. After rehydration, patients should \\nresume their usual diet (breast milk, formula).\\nWhen rehydration is complete, maintenance therapy should \\nbe started, using 100 mL o f ORS/kg in 24 hours until the diarrhea \\nstops. Breast feeding or formula feeding should be maintained \\nand not delayed for more than 24 hours. Patients with more \\nsevere diarrhea require continued supervision. The volume of \\nORS ingested should equal the volume of stool losses. If stool \\nvolume cannot be measured, an intake of 10-15  mL o f ORS/\\nkg per hour is appropriate.\\nMONITORING AND ADJUSTING THERAPY\\nTABLE 33.6 Fluid Management of Dehydration\\nRestore intravascular volume\\nNormal saline: 20 mL/kg over 20 min\\nRepeat as needed\\nRapid volume repletion: 20  mL/kg normal saline (maximum = 1 L) \\nover 2 hr\\nCalculate 24-hr fluid needs: maintenance + deficit volume\\nSubtract isotonic fluid already administered from 24-hr fluid needs\\nAdminister remaining volume over 24  hr using D5 12  normal \\nsaline + 20 mEq/L KCl\\nReplace ongoing losses as they occur\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHypernatremia\\nHyponatremia\\nTABLE 33.7 Monitoring Therapy\\nVital signs\\n Pulse\\n Blood pressure\\nIntake and output\\n Fluid balance\\n Urine output and specific gravity\\nPhysical examination\\n Weight\\n Clinical signs of fluid volume depletion or overload\\nElectrolytes\\nAll calculations in fluid therapy are only approximations. \\nThus the patient needs to be monitored during treatment with \\ntherapy modifications based on the clinical situation (Table 33.7).\\nHyponatremic dehydration occurs in children who have \\ndiarrhea and consume a hypotonic fluid (water or diluted \\nformula).

Most \\npatients with hyponatremic dehydration do well with the same \\ngeneral approach outlined in Table 33.6.

Catheter-related \\nsepsis, most commonly due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, \\nis common and, on occasion, necessitates catheter removal. \\nOther potential pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, gram-\\nnegative bacilli, and fungi.

Current PN decreases the risk \\nof liver disease by including reduced amounts of hepatotoxic \\namino acids. The best preventive strategy is early use of the \\ngastrointestinal tract, even if only trophic feeds are tolerated.\\nCHAPTER 35 \\nSodium Disorders\\nThe kidney regulates sodium balance and is the principal site \\nof sodium excretion. Sodium is unique among electrolytes \\nbecause water balance, not sodium balance, usually determines \\nits concentration. When the sodium concentration increases, \\nthe resultant higher plasma osmolality causes increased thirst \\nand increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which \\nleads to renal conservation of water. Both of these mechanisms \\nincrease the water content of the body, and the sodium con-\\ncentration returns to normal. During hyponatremia, the fall \\nin plasma osmolality decreases ADH secretion, and consequent \\nrenal water excretion leads to an increase in the sodium \\nconcentration. Although water balance is usually regulated by \\nosmolality, volume depletion also stimulates thirst, ADH secre-\\ntion, and renal conservation of water. In fact, volume depletion \\ntakes precedence over osmolality; volume depletion stimulates \\nADH secretion, even if a patient has hyponatremia.\\nThe excretion of sodium by the kidney is not determined \\nby the plasma osmolality. The patient’s effective plasma volume \\nregulates the amount of sodium in the urine through a variety of \\nregulatory systems, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \\nsystem. In hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the underlying \\npathophysiology determines the urinary sodium concentration, \\nnot the serum sodium concentration.\\nHYPONATREMIA\\nindication for PN eventually may be transitioned to partial or \\nfull enteral feedings.\\nACCESS FOR PARENTERAL NUTRITION\\nPN can be given via either a peripheral intravenous (IV) line \\nor a central venous line (CVL). Long-term PN should be given \\nvia a CVL. Acute PN may be given peripherally, although a \\ntemporary CVL is often used. Most children with cancer or \\nreceiving a bone marrow transplant have a CVL. A peripherally \\ninserted central catheter is an excellent source of central access \\nfor acute PN because of the lower risk for complications than \\nwith a standard CVL.\\nA peripheral IV line has two major limitations. First, it \\nfrequently fails, necessitating interruption of PN and potentially \\npainful placement of a new line. Second, high-osmolality solu-\\ntions cause phlebitis of peripheral veins; this limits the dextrose \\nand amino acid content of peripheral PN. The dextrose content \\nof peripheral PN cannot be greater than 12%, with a lower limit \\nif the amino acid concentration is high. Lipid emulsion has a \\nlow osmolality; therefore it can be administered peripherally \\nvia the same IV line as the dextrose and amino acid solution. \\nPatients can receive adequate nutrition via a peripheral IV line, \\nbut the volume of PN needs to be higher than is necessary \\nwhen central access is available because of the limitations on \\ndextrose and amino acid concentration. This situation may be \\nproblematic in patients who cannot tolerate larger fluid volumes.\\nCOMPOSITION OF PARENTERAL NUTRITION\\nPN can provide calories, amino acids, electrolytes, minerals, \\nessential fatty acids, vitamins, iron, and trace elements. The \\ncalories in PN are from dextrose and fat. The amino acids in \\nPN are a potential source of calories, but they should be used \\npredominantly for protein synthesis. PN is given as two separate \\nsolutions: a dextrose plus amino acid solution and a 20% lipid \\nemulsion. The dextrose solution has all of the other components \\nof PN except for fat.\\nThe dextrose concentration of peripheral PN is typically \\n10-12%, whereas central PN has a concentration of about 20%, \\nalthough it may be increased to 25-30% in patients who are \\nfluid restricted. To avoid hyperglycemia, the dextrose delivery \\nis increased gradually when starting PN. Protein delivery in PN \\nis via amino acids in the dextrose solution. The goal is 0.8-2  g \\nprotein/kg per 24 hour for older children, 1.5-3  g/kg p er 24 \\nhour for full-term and older infants, and 2.5-3.5  g/kg p er 24 \\nhour for preterm infants.\\nThe electrolyte and mineral composition of PN depends \\non the age and the underlying illness. The 20% lipid emulsion \\nprovides essential fatty acids and calories. The lipid emulsion \\nis started at a rate of 0.5-1 g/kg p er 24 hour, gradually increas-\\ning the rate so that the patient receives adequate calories; this \\ntypically requires 2.5-3.5 g/kg p er 24 hour. The lipid emulsion \\nusually provides 30-40% of the required calories; it should not \\nexceed 60%. The serum triglyceride concentration is monitored \\nas the rate of lipid emulsion is increased, with reduction of the \\nlipid emulsion rate if significant hypertriglyceridemia develops.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nThere are many potential complications of PN.

In the syndrome of inappropriate ADH \\n(SIADH), there is secretion of ADH that is not inhibited by \\neither low serum osmolality or expanded intravascular volume. \\nRetention of water causes hyponatremia, and the expansion of \\nthe intravascular volume results in an increase in renal sodium \\nexcretion. SIADH is associated with stress, pneumonia, mechani-\\ncal ventilation, meningitis, and other central nervous system \\ndisorders (trauma). Ectopic (tumor) production of ADH is \\nrare in children. Infants can develop euvolemic hyponatremia \\nas a result of excessive water consumption or inappropriately \\ndiluted formula.\\nIn hypervolemic hyponatremia, there is an excess of total \\nbody water and sodium, although the increase in water is greater \\nthan the increase in sodium. In renal failure, there is an inability \\nto excrete sodium or water; the urine sodium may be low or \\nhigh, depending on the cause of the renal insufficiency. In other \\ncauses of hypervolemic hyponatremia, there is a decrease in \\nthe effective blood volume because of either third space fluid \\nloss or poor cardiac output (see Chapter 145). In response \\nto the low effective blood volume, ADH causes renal water \\nretention, and the kidneys also retain sodium, which leads to \\na low urine sodium concentration. The patient’s serum sodium \\nconcentration decreases when water intake exceeds sodium \\nintake, and ADH prevents the normal loss of excess water.\\nthe measured osmolality is low, whereas it is normal in pseu -\\ndohyponatremia. Hyperosmolality, resulting from mannitol \\ninfusion or hyperglycemia, causes a low serum sodium con -\\ncentration, because water moves down its osmotic gradient \\nfrom the intracellular space into the extracellular space, diluting \\nthe sodium concentration. For every 100 m g/dL increment of \\nthe serum glucose, the serum sodium decreases by 1.6 mE q/L. \\nBecause the manifestations of hyponatremia are due to the low \\nplasma osmolality, patients with hyponatremia caused by \\nhyperosmolality do not have symptoms of hyponatremia and \\ndo not require the correction of hyponatremia.\\nClassification of true hyponatremia is based on the patient’s \\nvolume status (see Fig. 35.1). In hypovolemic hyponatremia, \\nthe child has lost sodium from the body. Water balance may \\nbe positive or negative, but there has been a higher net sodium \\nloss than water loss; this is often due to oral or intravenous (IV) \\nwater intake, with water retention by the kidneys to compensate \\nfor the intravascular volume depletion. If the sodium loss is \\ndue to a nonrenal disease (e.g., diarrhea), the urine sodium \\nconcentration is very low, as the kidneys attempt to preserve the \\nintravascular volume by conserving sodium. In renal diseases, \\nthe urine sodium is inappropriately elevated.\\nPatients with hyponatremia and no evidence of volume \\noverload or volume depletion have euvolemic hyponatremia. \\nThese patients typically have an excess of total body water and a \\nslight decrease in total body sodium.

A child often \\nimproves after receiving 4-6 mL/kg of 3% sodium chloride.\\nHYPERNATREMIA\\nClinical Manifestations\\nHyponatremia causes a fall in the osmolality of the extracellular \\nspace. Because the intracellular space then has a higher osmolal-\\nity, water moves from the extracellular space to the intracellular \\nspace to maintain osmotic equilibrium. The increase in intracel-\\nlular water may cause cells to swell. Brain cell swelling  is \\nresponsible for most of the symptoms of hyponatremia. \\nNeurological symptoms of hyponatremia include anorexia, \\nnausea, emesis, malaise, lethargy, confusion, agitation, headache, \\nseizures, coma, and decreased reflexes. Patients may develop \\nhypothermia, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, muscle cramps, and \\nweakness. Symptoms are more severe when hyponatremia \\ndevelops rapidly; chronic hyponatremia can be asymptomatic \\nbecause of a compensatory decrease in brain cell osmolality, \\nwhich limits cerebral swelling.\\nTreatment\\nRapid correction of hyponatremia can produce central pontine \\nmyelinolysis. Avoiding more than a 12-mEq/L increase in the \\nserum sodium every 24 hours is prudent, especially in chronic \\nhyponatremia. Treatment of hypovolemic hyponatremia requires \\nadministration of IV fluids with sodium to provide maintenance \\nrequirements and deficit correction, and to replace ongoing \\nlosses (see Chapter 33). For children with SIADH, water restric-\\ntion is the cornerstone of therapy, although vaptans, which are \\nADH antagonists, have a role in some patients. Children with \\nhyponatremia secondary to hypothyroidism or cortisol deficiency \\nneed specific hormone replacement. Acute water intoxication \\nrapidly self-corrects with the transient restriction of water intake, \\nwhich is followed by introduction of a normal diet. Treatment \\nof hypervolemic hyponatremia centers on restriction of water \\nand sodium intake, but disease-specific measures, such as dialysis \\nin renal failure, may also be necessary.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHypernatremia\\nHYPERNATREMIA\\nExcessive Sodium Water Deficit\\n Low Urine Osmolality\\n    Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\\n    Central diabetes insipidus\\n High Urine Osmolality\\n  Increased insensible losses\\n     Premature infants\\n     Radiant warmers\\n     Phototherapy\\n Inadequate intake\\n     Ineffective breast feeding\\n     Child neglect or abuse\\n     Adipsia (lack of thirst)\\nWater and Sodium Deficits\\n Low Urine Output\\n (Urine maximally concentrated)\\n   GI losses\\n       Diarrhea\\n       Emesis/NG suction\\n       Osmotic cathartics (lactulose)\\n  Cutaneous losses\\n       Burns\\n       Excessive sweating\\n High Urine Output\\n (Urine not maximally concentrated)\\n       Osmotic diuretics (mannitol)\\n       Diabetes mellitus\\n       Chronic kidney disease\\n       Polyuric phase of acute \\n          tubular necrosis\\n       Postobstructive diuresis \\nImproperly mixed formula\\nExcess sodium bicarbonate\\nIngestion of seawater \\n   or sodium chloride\\nIntentional salt poisoning\\nIntravenous hypertonic saline\\nHyperaldosteronism\\nFIGURE 35.2  Differential diagnosis of hypernatremia by mechanism.

If the serum sodium concentration is lowered rapidly, \\nthere is movement of water from the serum into the brain cells \\nto equalize the osmolality in the two compartments. The \\nresultant brain swelling manifests as seizures or coma. Because \\nof these dangers, hypernatremia should be corrected slowly. \\nThe goal is to decrease the serum sodium by less than 12 mE q/L \\nevery 24 hours (see Fig. 33.1). The most important components \\nof correcting moderate or severe hypernatremia are restoring \\nthe effective intravascular volume and then frequently monitor-\\ning the serum sodium to allow adjustment of fluid therapy and \\nto provide adequate correction that is neither too slow nor too \\nfast.\\nIn a child with hypernatremic dehydration, as in any child \\nwith dehydration, the first priority is restoration of intravas-\\ncular volume with isotonic fluid. Fig. 33.1 outlines a general \\napproach for correcting hypernatremic dehydration secondary \\nto gastroenteritis. If the hypernatremia and dehydration are \\nsecondary to water loss, as occurs with diabetes insipidus, a more \\nhypotonic IV fluid is appropriate. A child with central diabetes \\ninsipidus should receive an ADH analog to prevent further \\nexcessive water loss. A child with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus \\nrequires a urine replacement solution to offset ongoing water \\nlosses. Chronically, reduced sodium intake, thiazide diuretics, \\nand nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can decrease water \\nlosses in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\\nAcute, severe hypernatremia, usually secondary to sodium \\nadministration, can be corrected more rapidly because idiogenic \\nosmoles have not had time to accumulate; this balances the \\nhigh morbidity and mortality from severe, acute hypernatremia \\nwith the dangers of overly rapid correction. When hyperna-\\ntremia is due to sodium intoxication, and the hypernatremia \\nis severe, it may be impossible to administer enough water to \\nrapidly correct the hypernatremia without worsening volume \\noverload. Some patients require the use of a loop diuretic  \\nor dialysis.\\nCHAPTER 36 \\nPotassium Disorders\\nThe kidneys are the principal regulator of potassium balance, \\nadjusting excretion based on intake. Factors affecting renal \\npotassium excretion include aldosterone, acid-base status, serum \\npotassium concentration, and renal function. The intracellular \\npotassium concentration is approximately 30 times the extracel-\\nlular potassium concentration. A variety of conditions alter \\nthe distribution of potassium between the intracellular and \\nextracellular compartments, potentially causing either hypo-\\nkalemia or hyperkalemia. The plasma concentration does not \\nalways reflect the total body potassium content.\\nHYPOKALEMIA\\nmassive urinary water losses. Because it is most commonly an \\nX-linked disorder due to a mutation in the gene for the ADH \\nreceptor, it usually occurs in boys, who may have episodes of \\nsevere hypernatremic dehydration and failure to thrive. Acquired \\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus may be secondary to interstitial \\nnephritis, sickle cell disease, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or \\nmedications (lithium). If the defect is due to central diabetes \\ninsipidus, urine output decreases and urine osmolality increases \\nin response to administration of an ADH analog. Central causes \\nof ADH deficiency include tumor, infarction, or trauma. There \\nis no response to an ADH analog in a child with nephrogenic \\ndiabetes insipidus.\\nDiarrhea results in sodium and water depletion. Most \\nchildren with gastroenteritis do not develop hypernatremia \\nbecause they drink enough hypotonic fluid to compensate at \\nleast partially for stool water losses. Hypernatremia is most likely \\nin a child with diarrhea who has inadequate intake because \\nof emesis, lack of access to water, or anorexia. Some renal \\ndiseases, including obstructive uropathy, renal dysplasia, and \\njuvenile nephronophthisis, can cause losses of sodium and water, \\npotentially producing hypernatremia if the patient consumes \\ninsufficient water.\\nIn situations with combined sodium and water deficits, \\nanalysis of the urine differentiates renal and nonrenal etiologies. \\nWhen the losses are extrarenal, the kidney responds to volume \\ndepletion with low urine volume, a concentrated urine, and \\nsodium retention (urine sodium <10 mE q/L). With renal causes, \\nthe urine volume is usually high, the urine is not maximally \\nconcentrated, and the urine sodium may be inappropriately \\nelevated.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nMost children with hypernatremia are dehydrated and have \\nthe typical signs and symptoms of dehydration (see Chapter \\n33). Children with hypernatremic dehydration tend to have \\nbetter preservation of intravascular volume owing to the shift  \\nof water from the intracellular space to the extracellular space. \\nHypernatremic infants potentially become more dehydrated \\nbefore seeking medical attention. Probably because of intracel-\\nlular water loss, the pinched abdominal skin of a dehydrated, \\nhypernatremic infant has a doughy feel.\\nHypernatremia, even without dehydration, causes central \\nnervous system symptoms that tend to parallel the degree of \\nsodium elevation and the acuity of the increase. Patients are \\nirritable, restless, weak, and lethargic. Some infants have a high-\\npitched cry and hyperpnea; hypernatremia may cause fever. \\nAlert patients are very thirsty, although nausea may be present.\\nBrain hemorrhage is the most devastating consequence of \\nhypernatremia. As the extracellular osmolality increases, water \\nmoves out of brain cells, resulting in a decrease in brain volume. \\nThis decrease in volume can result in tearing of intracerebral \\nveins and bridging blood vessels as the brain moves away from \\nthe skull and the meninges. Patients may have subarachnoid, \\nsubdural, and parenchymal hemorrhage. Seizures and coma \\nare possible sequelae of the hemorrhage.\\nTreatment\\nAs hypernatremia develops, the brain generates idiogenic \\nosmoles to increase the intracellular osmolality and prevent \\nthe loss of brain water.

Poor intake is an unusual cause of \\nhypokalemia, unless it is also associated with significant weight \\nloss (anorexia nervosa).\\nDiarrhea has a high concentration of potassium, and the \\nresulting hypokalemia is usually associated with a metabolic \\nacidosis secondary to stool losses of bicarbonate.

Metabolic alkalosis and volume depletion \\nincrease urinary losses of potassium.\\nUrinary potassium wasting may be accompanied by a \\nmetabolic acidosis (proximal or distal renal tubular acidosis; \\nsee Chapter 37). Loop and thiazide diuretics lead to hypokalemia \\nand a metabolic alkalosis.

Spurious hypokalemia occurs in patients with \\nleukemia and elevated white blood cell counts if plasma for \\nanalysis is left at room temperature, permitting the white blood \\ncells to take up potassium from the plasma. There are four \\nbasic mechanisms of hypokalemia (Table 36.1). Low intake, \\nnonrenal losses, and renal losses all are associated with total \\nbody potassium depletion. With a transcellular shift , total \\nbody potassium is normal unless there is concomitant potassium \\ndepletion secondary to other factors.\\nThe transcellular shift of potassium after initiation of insulin \\ntherapy in children with diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter \\n171) can be dramatic. These patients have reduced total body \\npotassium because of urinary losses, but they often have a \\nnormal serum potassium level before insulin therapy from \\na transcellular shift into the extracellular space secondary to \\ninsulin deficiency and metabolic acidosis.

Severe, symptomatic \\nhypokalemia requires aggressive treatment. Supplementation \\nis more cautious if renal function is decreased because of the \\nkidney’s limited ability to excrete excessive potassium. The \\nplasma potassium level does not always provide an accurate \\nestimation of the total body potassium deficit because there \\nmay be shifts of potassium from the intracellular space to the \\nplasma. Clinically, this shift occurs most commonly with \\nmetabolic acidosis and as a result of the insulin deficiency of \\ndiabetic ketoacidosis; the plasma potassium underestimates \\nthe degree of total body potassium depletion.

In \\nthe individual patient, the etiology is sometimes multifactorial. \\nFactitious hyperkalemia is usually due to hemolysis during \\nphlebotomy, but it can be the result of prolonged tourniquet \\napplication or fist clenching during phlebotomy, which causes \\nlocal potassium release from muscle. Falsely elevated serum \\npotassium levels can occur when serum levels are measured \\nin patients with markedly elevated white blood cell or platelet \\ncounts; a promptly analyzed plasma sample usually provides \\nan accurate result.\\nBecause of the kidney’s ability to excrete potassium, it is \\nunusual for excessive intake, by itself, to cause hyperkalemia. \\nThis mechanism can occur in a patient who is receiving large \\nquantities of IV or oral potassium for excessive losses that \\nare no longer present. Frequent or rapid blood transfusions \\ncan increase the potassium level acutely secondary to the \\nhigh potassium content of stored blood. Increased intake may \\nprecipitate hyperkalemia if there is an underlying defect in \\npotassium excretion.\\nThe intracellular space has a high potassium concentration, \\nso a shift of potassium from the intracellular space  to the \\nproblems are corrected, potassium moves into the intracellular \\nspace, and these patients require more potassium supplementa-\\ntion to correct the hypokalemia. Patients who have ongoing \\nlosses of potassium need correction of the deficit and replace-\\nment of the ongoing losses.\\nBecause of the risk of hyperkalemia, intravenous (IV) potas-\\nsium should be used cautiously. Oral potassium is safer in \\nnonurgent situations. The dose of IV potassium is 0.5-1 mE q/kg, \\nusually given over 1 hour. The adult maximum dose is 40 mE q. \\nConservative dosing is generally preferred. For patients with \\nexcessive urinary losses, potassium-sparing diuretics are effective. \\nWhen hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and volume depletion \\nare present, restoration of intravascular volume decreases urinary \\npotassium losses.\\nHYPERKALEMIA\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHyperkalemia\\nTABLE 36.3 Causes of Hyperkalemia\\nSpurious laboratory value\\n Hemolysis\\n Tissue ischemia during blood drawing\\n Thrombocytosis\\n Leukocytosis\\nIncreased intake\\n IV or PO\\n Blood transfusions\\nTranscellular shifts\\n Acidemia\\n Rhabdomyolysis\\n Tumor lysis syndrome\\n Tissue necrosis\\n Hemolysis/hematomas/gastrointestinal bleeding\\n Succinylcholine\\n Digitalis intoxication\\n Fluoride intoxication\\n β-Adrenergic blockers\\n Exercise\\n Hyperosmolality\\n Insulin deficiency\\n Malignant hyperthermia\\n Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis\\nDecreased excretion\\n Renal failure\\n Primary adrenal disease\\n Acquired Addison disease\\n 21-hydroxylase deficiency\\n 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase deficiency\\n Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia\\n Adrenal hypoplasia congenita\\n Aldosterone synthase deficiency\\n Adrenoleukodystrophy\\nHyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism\\n Urinary tract obstruction\\n Sickle cell disease\\n Kidney transplant\\n Lupus nephritis\\nRenal tubular disease\\n Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1\\n Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2\\n Urinary tract obstruction\\n Sickle cell disease\\n Kidney transplant\\nMedications\\n ACE inhibitors\\n Angiotensin II blockers\\n Potassium-sparing diuretics\\n Cyclosporine\\n NSAIDs\\n Trimethoprim\\nACE, Angiotensin-converting enzyme; IV, intravenous; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; PO, oral.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Cell destruction, as seen in rhabdomyolysis or tumor \\nlysis syndrome, can cause concomitant hyperphosphatemia, \\nhyperuricemia, and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase.\\nTreatment\\nThe plasma potassium level, the ECG, and the risk of the problem \\nworsening determine the aggressiveness of the therapeutic \\napproach. A high serum potassium level with ECG changes \\nrequires more vigorous treatment. An additional source of \\nconcern is a patient with increasing plasma potassium despite \\nminimal intake. This situation can occur if there is cellular \\nrelease of potassium (tumor lysis syndrome), especially in the \\nsetting of diminished excretion (renal failure).\\nThe first action in a child with a concerning elevation of \\nplasma potassium is to stop all sources of additional potassium \\n(oral and IV). If the potassium level is greater than 6.5 mE q/L, \\nan ECG should be obtained to help assess the urgency of the \\nsituation. Therapy of hyperkalemia has two basic goals:\\n1. P revent life-threatening arrhythmias\\n2. R emove potassium from the body (Table 36.4)\\nTreatments that acutely prevent arrhythmias all work quickly \\n(within minutes), but do not remove potassium from the body.\\nLong-term management of hyperkalemia includes reduc-\\ning intake via dietary changes, and eliminating or reducing \\nmedications that cause hyperkalemia. Some patients require \\nmedications, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate and loop or \\nthiazide diuretics, to increase potassium losses. The disorders \\nthat are due to a deficiency in aldosterone respond to replace-\\nment therapy with fludrocortisone, which is a mineralocorticoid.\\nCHAPTER 37 \\nAcid-Base Disorders\\nClose regulation of pH is necessary for cellular enzymes and \\nother metabolic processes, which function optimally at a normal \\npH (7.35-7.45). Chronic, mild derangements in acid-base status \\nextracellular space can have a significant impact on the plasma \\npotassium. This shift occurs with acidosis, cell destruction \\n(rhabdomyolysis or tumor lysis syndrome), insulin deficiency, \\nmedications (succinylcholine, β-blockers), malignant hyper -\\nthermia, and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.\\nHyperkalemia secondary to decreased excretion occurs \\nwith renal insufficiency. The risk of hyperkalemia secondary to \\nmedications that decrease renal potassium excretion is greatest \\nin patients with underlying renal insufficiency.\\nAldosterone deficiency or unresponsiveness to aldosterone \\ncauses hyperkalemia, often with associated metabolic acidosis \\n(see Chapter 37) and hyponatremia. A form of congenital \\nadrenal hyperplasia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is the most \\nfrequent cause of aldosterone deficiency in children. Untreated \\npatients have hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, \\nand volume depletion.\\nRenin, via angiotensin II, stimulates aldosterone produc-\\ntion. A deficiency in renin, resulting from kidney damage, \\ncan lead to decreased aldosterone production. These patients \\ntypically have hyperkalemia and a metabolic acidosis, without \\nhyponatremia. Some patients have impaired renal function, \\npartially accounting for the hyperkalemia, but the impairment \\nin potassium excretion is more extreme than expected for the \\ndegree of renal insufficiency.\\nChildren with pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type 1  \\nhave hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and salt wasting, leading \\nto hyponatremia and volume depletion; aldosterone levels are \\nelevated. In the autosomal recessive variant, there is a defect \\nin the renal sodium channel that is normally activated by \\naldosterone. In the autosomal dominant form, patients have a \\ndefect in the aldosterone receptor, and the disease is milder, \\noften remitting in adulthood. PHA type 2, also called Gordon \\nsyndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by \\nhypertension secondary to salt retention and impaired excretion \\nof potassium and acid, leading to hyperkalemia and metabolic \\nacidosis. PHA type 2 responds to a thiazide diuretic.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe most import effects of hyperkalemia are due to the role of \\npotassium in membrane polarization. The cardiac conduction \\nsystem is usually the dominant concern. ECG changes begin \\nwith peaking of the T waves. As the potassium level increases, \\nan increased P-R interval, flattening of the P wave, and widening \\nof the QRS complex occur; this eventually can progress to \\nventricular fibrillation. Asystole also may occur. Some patients \\nhave paresthesias, weakness, and tingling, but cardiac toxicity \\nusually precedes these clinical symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe etiology of hyperkalemia is often readily apparent. Spurious \\nhyperkalemia is common in children, so a repeat potassium \\nlevel is often appropriate. If there is a significant elevation of \\nthe white blood cells or platelets, the repeat sample should be \\nfrom plasma that is evaluated promptly. Initially, the history \\nshould focus on potassium intake, risk factors for transcellular \\nshifts of potassium, medications that cause hyperkalemia, and \\nthe presence of signs of renal insufficiency, such as oliguria or \\nan abnormal urinalysis. Initial laboratory evaluation should \\ninclude serum creatinine and assessment of acid-base status. \\nMany causes of hyperkalemia, such as renal insufficiency and \\nTABLE 36.4 Treatment of Hyperkalemia\\nRapidly decrease the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias\\n Shift potassium intracellularly\\n  Sodium bicarbonate administration (IV)\\n  Insulin and glucose (IV)\\n  β-agonist (albuterol via nebulizer)\\n Cardiac membrane stabilization\\n  IV calcium\\nRemove potassium from the body\\n Loop diuretic (IV or PO)\\n Sodium polystyrene (PO or rectal)\\n Dialysis\\nIV, Intravenous; PO, oral.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Control of acid-base \\nbalance depends on the kidneys, the lungs, and the intracellular \\nand extracellular buffers.\\nThe lungs and kidneys maintain a normal acid-base balance. \\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal metabolism is a \\nweak acid. The lungs prevent an increase in the partial pressure \\nof CO2 (PCO2) in the blood by excreting the CO2. Production of \\nCO2 varies depending on the body’s metabolic needs.

An adult normally \\nproduces about 1-2 mE q/kg per day of hydrogen ions, whereas \\na child produces 2-3 mE q/kg per day. The hydrogen ions from \\nendogenous acid production are neutralized by bicarbonate, \\npotentially causing the bicarbonate concentration to fall.

Acidosis is a pathological process \\nthat causes an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration, and \\nalkalosis is a pathological process that causes a decrease in the \\nhydrogen ion concentration. A simple acid-base disorder is a \\nsingle primary disturbance. During a simple metabolic disorder, \\nthere is respiratory compensation; the PCO2 decreases during \\nmetabolic acidosis and increases during metabolic alkalosis. \\nWith metabolic acidosis, the decrease in the pH increases the \\nventilatory drive, causing a decrease in the PCO2. The fall in \\nthe CO 2 concentration leads to an increase in the pH. This \\nappropriate respiratory compensation for a metabolic process \\nhappens quickly and is complete within 12–24 hours.\\nDuring a primary respiratory process, there is metabolic \\ncompensation mediated by the kidneys. The kidneys respond \\nto a respiratory acidosis by increasing hydrogen ion excre-\\ntion, increasing bicarbonate generation, and raising the serum \\nbicarbonate concentration. The kidneys increase bicarbonate \\nexcretion to compensate for a respiratory alkalosis; the serum \\nbicarbonate concentration decreases. In contrast to a rapid \\nrespiratory compensation, it takes 3-4 days for the kidneys \\nto complete appropriate metabolic compensation. However, \\nthere is a small and rapid compensatory change in the bicarbon-\\nate concentration during a primary respiratory process. The \\nexpected appropriate metabolic compensation for a respiratory \\ndisorder depends on whether the process is acute or chronic.\\nA mixed acid-base disorder is present when there is more \\nthan one primary acid-base disturbance.

Lactic acidosis most commonly occurs when inadequate \\noxygen delivery to the tissues leads to anaerobic metabolism \\nand excess production of lactic acid. Lactic acidosis may be \\nsecondary to shock, severe anemia, or hypoxemia. Inborn errors \\nof carbohydrate metabolism produce a severe lactic acidosis \\n(see Chapter 52). In diabetes mellitus, inadequate insulin leads \\nto hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (see Chapter 171). \\nRenal failure (see Chapter 165) causes metabolic acidosis because \\nthe kidneys are unable to excrete the acid produced by normal \\nmetabolism.\\nA variety of toxic ingestions cause metabolic acidosis. Acute \\nsalicylate intoxication occurs after a large overdose. Chronic \\nsalicylate intoxication is possible because of the gradual buildup \\nof the drug. Patients may also have a respiratory alkalosis. Other \\nsymptoms of salicylate intoxication include fever, seizures, leth-\\nargy, and coma. Hyperventilation may be particularly marked. \\nTinnitus, vertigo, and hearing impairment are more likely with \\nchronic salicylate intoxication. Ethylene glycol, a component \\nof antifreeze, is converted in the liver to glyoxylic and oxalic \\nacids, causing a severe metabolic acidosis. Excessive oxalate \\nexcretion causes calcium oxalate crystals to appear in the urine, \\nand calcium oxalate precipitation in the kidney tubules can cause \\nrenal failure. The toxicity of methanol ingestion also depends \\non liver metabolism; formic acid is the toxic end product that \\ncauses the metabolic acidosis and other sequelae, which include \\ndamage to the optic nerve and central nervous system.\\nThere are many inborn errors of metabolism that may cause \\nmetabolic acidosis (see Section 10). Metabolic acidosis may be \\ndue to excessive production of ketoacids, lactic acid, or other \\norganic anions. Some patients may have accompanying hyperam-\\nmonemia. In most patients, acidosis occurs only episodically \\nduring acute decompensations, which may be precipitated by \\nthe ingestion of specific dietary substrates (proteins), the stress \\nof a mild illness (fasting, catabolism), or poor adherence with \\ndietary or medical therapy.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe underlying disorder usually produces most of the signs \\nand symptoms in children with a mild or moderate metabolic \\nacidosis. The clinical manifestations of the acidosis are related \\nto the degree of acidemia; patients with appropriate respiratory \\ncompensation and less severe acidemia have fewer manifestations \\nthan patients with a concomitant respiratory acidosis. At a \\nserum pH less than 7.20, there is impaired cardiac contractility \\nand an increased risk of arrhythmias, especially if underlying \\nheart disease or other predisposing electrolyte disorders are \\npresent. With acidemia, there is a decrease in the cardiovascular \\nresponse to catecholamines, potentially exacerbating hypotension \\nin children with volume depletion or shock. Acidemia causes \\nvasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature, which is \\nespecially problematic in neonates with primary pulmonary \\nhypertension of the newborn (see Chapter 61). The normal \\nrespiratory response to metabolic acidosis—compensatory \\nhyperventilation—may be subtle with mild metabolic acidosis, \\nbut it causes discernible increased respiratory effort with \\nworsening acidemia. Chronic metabolic acidosis causes failure \\nto thrive.\\nEtiology\\nThe plasma anion gap is useful for evaluating patients with \\nmetabolic acidosis. It divides patients into two diagnostic groups: \\nnormal anion gap and increased anion gap. The following \\nformula determines the anion gap:\\nAnion GapN aC lH CO=+ −+− −() 3\\nA normal anion gap is 12 ± 2 mEq/L.\\nNormal anion gap metabolic acidosis occurs in the setting \\nof diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Diarrhea causes a \\nloss of bicarbonate from the body. The amount of bicarbonate \\nlost in the stool depends on the volume of diarrhea and the \\nbicarbonate concentration of the stool, which tends to increase \\nwith more severe diarrhea. Diarrhea often causes volume \\ndepletion because of losses of sodium and water, potentially \\nexacerbating the acidosis by causing hypoperfusion (shock) \\nand a lactic acidosis.\\nThere are three forms of RTA:\\n1. Di stal (type I)\\n2. P roximal (type II)\\n3. H yperkalemic (type IV)\\nIn distal RTA (dRTA), children may have accompanying \\nhypokalemia, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and nephrocal -\\ncinosis; rickets is a less common finding. Failure to thrive, \\nresulting from chronic metabolic acidosis, is the most common \\npresenting complaint. Autosomal dominant (relatively mild) \\nand autosomal recessive (more severe) forms of dRTA exist. \\nAutosomal recessive dRTA is often associated with deafness \\nsecondary to a defect in the gene for a H+-ATPase that is present \\nin the kidney and the inner ear. dRTA also may be secondary \\nto medications or congenital or acquired renal disease. Patients \\nwith dRTA cannot acidify their urine and have a urine pH \\ngreater than 5.5, despite metabolic acidosis.\\nProximal RTA is rarely present in isolation. In most patients, \\nproximal RTA is part of Fanconi syndrome, a generalized \\ndysfunction of the proximal tubule. Along with renal wasting \\nof bicarbonate, Fanconi syndrome causes glycosuria, aminoac-\\niduria, and excessive urinary losses of phosphate and uric acid. \\nThe chronic hypophosphatemia is more clinically significant \\nbecause it ultimately leads to rickets in children. Rickets or failure \\nto thrive may be the presenting complaint. Fanconi syndrome is \\nrarely an isolated genetic disorder, with pediatric cases usually \\nsecondary to an underlying genetic disorder, most commonly \\ncystinosis. Medications, such as ifosfamide or valproate, may \\ncause Fanconi syndrome. The ability to acidify the urine is \\nintact in proximal RTA, and untreated patients have a urine \\npH less than 5.5.\\nIn hyperkalemic RTA, renal excretion of acid and potas -\\nsium is impaired because of either an absence of aldosterone \\nor an inability of the kidney to respond to aldosterone. In \\nsevere aldosterone deficiency, as occurs with congenital \\nadrenal hyperplasia secondary to 21α-hydroxylase deficiency, \\nthe hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis are accompanied \\nby hyponatremia and volume depletion from renal salt \\nwasting. Incomplete aldosterone deficiency causes less severe \\nelectrolyte disturbances; children may have isolated hyper-\\nkalemic RTA, hyperkalemia without acidosis, or isolated  \\nhyponatremia.\\nDistal and hyperkalemic RTA are similar in that distal tubular \\nacidification is impaired.

Hypokalemia is often present and occasionally \\nsevere (see Chapter 36). Children with chloride-responsive \\ncauses of metabolic alkalosis often have symptoms related to \\nvolume depletion (see Chapter 33). In contrast, children with \\nchloride-unresponsive causes may have symptoms related to \\nhypertension. Severe alkalemia may cause arrhythmias, hypoxia \\nsecondary to hypoventilation, or decreased cardiac output.\\nDiagnosis\\nMeasurement of the urinary chloride concentration is the most \\nhelpful test in differentiating among the causes of metabolic \\nalkalosis. The history usually suggests a diagnosis, although \\nno obvious explanation may be present in the patient with \\nbulimia, surreptitious diuretic use, or an undiagnosed genetic \\ndisorder, such as Bartter syndrome or Gitelman syndrome.\\nTreatment\\nThe approach to therapy of metabolic alkalosis depends on the \\nseverity of the alkalosis and the underlying etiology. In children \\nwith mild metabolic alkalosis ([]HCOm Eq L3 32− < ), interven-\\ntion is often unnecessary. Patients with chloride-responsive \\nDiagnosis\\nCalculating the anion gap can help narrow the differential \\ndiagnosis for acidosis. However, the anion gap should not be \\ninterpreted in dogmatic isolation; consideration of other labora-\\ntory abnormalities and the clinical history improves its diagnostic \\nutility. A decrease in the albumin concentration of 1  g/dL \\ndecreases the anion gap by roughly 4  mE q/L. Similarly, albeit \\nless commonly, an increase in unmeasured cations, such as \\ncalcium, potassium, or magnesium, decreases the anion gap. \\nConversely, a decrease in unmeasured cations is a rare cause \\nof an increased anion gap. Because of these variables, the broad \\nrange of a normal anion gap, and other factors, the presence \\nof a normal or increased anion gap is not always reliable in \\ndifferentiating the causes of a metabolic acidosis, especially \\nwhen the metabolic acidosis is mild. Some patients have more \\nthan one explanation for their metabolic acidosis, such as a \\nchild with diarrhea and lactic acidosis secondary to shock.\\nTreatment\\nThe most effective therapeutic approach for patients with a \\nmetabolic acidosis is correction of the underlying disorder, if \\npossible. The administration of insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis \\nor restoration of adequate perfusion in lactic acidosis from \\nshock eventually results in normalization of acid-base balance. \\nThe use of bicarbonate therapy is indicated when the underlying \\ndisorder is irreparable; examples include RTA and chronic renal \\nfailure. In salicylate poisoning, alkali administration increases \\nrenal clearance of salicylate and decreases the amount of \\nsalicylate in brain cells. Short-term base therapy is often neces-\\nsary in other poisonings and inborn errors of metabolism.\\nMETABOLIC ALKALOSIS\\nEtiology\\nThe causes of a metabolic alkalosis are divided into two categories \\nbased on the urinary chloride (Table 37.3). The alkalosis in \\npatients with a low urinary chloride is maintained by volume \\ndepletion. They are called chloride responsive because volume \\nrepletion with fluid containing sodium chloride and potassium \\nchloride is necessary to correct the metabolic alkalosis. Emesis, \\nwhich causes loss of hydrochloride and volume depletion, is \\nthe most common cause of a metabolic alkalosis. Diuretic use \\nincreases chloride excretion in the urine. Consequently, while \\na patient is receiving diuretics, the urinary chloride is typically \\nhigh (>20 mE q/L). After the diuretic effect resolves, the urinary \\nchloride is low (< 15 mE q/L) because of appropriate renal \\nchloride retention in response to volume depletion. Categoriza-\\ntion of diuretics based on urinary chloride depends on the \\ntiming of the measurement. The metabolic alkalosis from \\ndiuretics is clearly chloride responsive; it corrects after adequate \\nvolume repletion. This is the rationale for including it among \\nthe chloride-responsive causes of a metabolic alkalosis.\\nThe chloride-resistant causes of metabolic alkalosis can \\nbe subdivided based on blood pressure. Patients with the rare \\ndisorders that cause metabolic alkalosis and hypertension either \\nhave increased aldosterone or act as if they have increased \\naldosterone. Patients with Bartter syndrome or Gitelman \\nsyndrome (Chapter 36) have metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, \\nand normal blood pressure secondary to renal tubular defects, \\nwhich cause continuous urinary losses of chloride.\\nTABLE 37.3 Causes of Metabolic Alkalosis\\nCHLORIDE RESPONSIVE (URINARY CHLORIDE <15 mEq/L)\\nGastric losses (emesis or nasogastric suction)\\nPyloric stenosis\\nDiuretics (loop or thiazide)\\nChloride-losing diarrhea\\nChloride-deficient formula\\nCystic fibrosis (sweat losses of chloride)\\nPosthypercapnia (chloride loss during respiratory acidosis)\\nCHLORIDE RESISTANT (URINARY CHLORIDE >20 mEq/L)\\nHigh Blood Pressure\\nAdrenal adenoma or hyperplasia\\nGlucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism\\nRenovascular disease\\nRenin-secreting tumor\\n17α-hydroxylase deficiency\\n11β-hydroxylase deficiency\\nCushing syndrome\\n11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency\\nLicorice ingestion\\nLiddle syndrome\\nNormal Blood Pressure\\nGitelman syndrome\\nBartter syndrome\\nBase administration\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The latter depends on air movement, alveolar gas \\nexchange, pulmonary blood flow, and hemoglobin-oxygen \\nbinding characteristics.\\nHISTORY\\nIn the initial assessment of an acutely ill or traumatically injured \\nchild, access to historical information may be limited. Char-\\nacterization of the onset of symptoms, event details, and a brief \\nidentification of underlying medical problems should be sought \\nby members of the team not actively involved in the resuscitation. \\nThe mnemonic AMPLE can be employed to help direct a focused \\nhistory during this time: A, Allergies; M, Medications; P , Past \\nmedical history; L, Last meal; and E, Events leading up to \\npatient presentation. Attempts at identifying historical issues \\nthat affect the ABCs are useful but should not delay intervention \\nif tissue oxygenation and perfusion are markedly impaired.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nInitial examination must focus on the responsiveness of a patient \\nfollowed by assessment of the ABCs (Table 38.1) to systematically \\naddress the issues of oxygen delivery to tissues. Assessment of \\nairway patency should also include evaluation of the neurologi-\\ncally injured child’s ability to protect the airway. Protection of \\nthe cervical spine should be initiated at this step in any child \\nwith traumatic injury or who presents with altered mental status \\nof uncertain etiology. Assessment of breathing includes observa-\\ntion of respiratory effort, rate, and chest rise, plus the ausculta-\\ntion of air movement and the application of a pulse oximeter \\n(when available) to identify current oxygenation status. Circula-\\ntory status is assessed by palpation for distal and central pulses, \\nfocusing on the presence and quality of the pulses. Bounding \\npulses and a wide pulse pressure are often the first sign of the \\nvasodilatory phase of shock and require immediate resuscitation \\nmeasures. Weak, thready, or absent pulses are indicators for \\nfluid resuscitation, initiation of chest compressions, or both. \\nWhen assessment of the ABCs is complete and measures have \\nbeen taken to achieve an acceptable level of tissue oxygenation, \\na more complete physical examination is performed. The \\nsequence of this examination depends on whether the situation \\ninvolves an acute medical illness or trauma. In trauma patients, \\nthe examination follows the ABCDE pathway. D stands for \\ndisability and prompts assessment of the neurological system \\nand evaluation for major traumatic injuries. E stands for \\nexposure; the child is disrobed and examined for evidence of \\nany life-threatening or limb-threatening problems. For the \\nacutely ill and the injured child, the physical examination should \\nidentify evidence of organ dysfunction, starting with areas \\nsuggested in the chief complaint and progressing to a thorough \\nand systematic investigation of the entire patient.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe physiological responses to acute illness and injury are \\nmechanisms that attempt to correct inadequacies of tissue \\noxygenation and perfusion. When initial changes, such as \\nincreasing heart and respiratory rates, fail to meet the body’s \\nneeds, other manifestations of impending cardiopulmonary \\nfailure occur (Table 38.2). Respiratory failure, the most common \\ncause of acute deterioration in children, may result in inadequate \\ntissue oxygenation and in respiratory acidosis. Signs and \\nsymptoms of respiratory failure (tachypnea, tachycardia, \\nincreased work of breathing, abnormal mentation) progress as \\ntissue oxygenation becomes more inadequate. Inadequate \\nperfusion (shock) leads to inadequate oxygen delivery and a \\nresulting metabolic acidosis. Shock is characterized by signs \\nof inadequate tissue perfusion (pallor, cool skin, poor pulses, \\ndelayed capillary refill, oliguria, and abnormal mentation). The \\npresence of any of these symptoms demands careful assessment \\nand intervention to correct the abnormality and to prevent \\nfurther deterioration.\\nINITIAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION\\nScreening Tests\\nDuring the initial phase of resuscitation, monitoring vital signs \\nand physiological status is the key screening activity. Continuous \\nmonitoring with attention to changes may indicate response \\nto therapy or further deterioration requiring additional \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

For an acutely ill child \\nwith respiratory distress, a chest x-ray is important. Appropriate \\ncultures should be obtained when sepsis is suspected. Children \\nwith historical or physical evidence of inadequate intravascular \\nvolume should have serum electrolyte levels obtained, including \\nbicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine.\\nRESUSCITATION\\nResuscitation is focused on correcting identified abnormalities \\nof oxygenation and perfusion and preventing further deteriora-\\ntion. Oxygen supplementation may improve oxygen saturation \\nbut may not completely correct tissue oxygenation. When oxygen \\nsupplementation is insufficient or air exchange is inadequate, \\nassisted ventilation must be initiated. Inadequate perfusion is \\nusually best managed initially by providing a fluid bolus. Isotonic \\ncrystalloids (normal saline, lactated Ringer solution) are the \\ninitial fluid of choice. A bolus of 10-20  mL/kg should be \\ndelivered in monitored conditions. Improvement, but not \\ncorrection, after an initial bolus should prompt repeated boluses \\nuntil circulation has been re-established. Because most children \\nwith shock have noncardiac causes, fluid administration of this \\nmagnitude is well tolerated. If hemorrhage is known or highly \\nsuspected, administration of packed red blood cells is appropri-\\nate. Monitoring for deteriorating physiological status during \\nfluid resuscitation (increase in heart rate, decrease in blood \\npressure) identifies children who may have diminished cardiac \\nfunction. In these cases, as fluid resuscitation increases the \\npreload, impaired cardiac function may worsen and pulmonary \\nedema can result. If deterioration occurs, fluid administration \\nshould be interrupted and further resuscitation should be aimed \\nat improving cardiac function.\\nWhen respiratory support and fluid resuscitation are \\ninsufficient, introduction of vasoactive substances is the next \\nstep. The choice of which agent to use depends on the type \\nof shock present. Hypovolemic shock (when further volume \\nis contraindicated) and distributive shock benefit from drugs \\nthat increase systemic vascular resistance (drugs with α-agonist \\nactivity, such as epinephrine or norepinephrine). The treatment \\nof cardiogenic shock is more complex. To improve cardiac output \\nby increasing the heart rate, drugs with positive chronotropy are \\nused (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine). Afterload \\nreduction, using drugs such as dobutamine, nitroprusside, or \\nmilrinone, also may be needed. Measuring central mixed venous \\nintervention. During the initial rapid assessment, diagnostic \\nevaluation often is limited to pulse oximetry and bedside \\nmeasurement of glucose levels. The latter is important in any \\nchild with altered mental status or at risk for inadequate glycogen \\nstores (infants, malnourished patients). After resuscitation \\nmeasures, further diagnostic tests and imaging are often \\nnecessary.\\nDiagnostic Tests and Imaging\\nThe choice of appropriate diagnostic tests and imaging is \\ndetermined by the mechanism of disease and the results of \\nevaluation after initial resuscitation. The initial evaluation  \\nof major trauma patients is focused on identifying evidence of \\nTABLE 38.1 Rapid Cardiopulmonary Assessment\\nAIRWAY PATENCY\\nAble to be maintained independently\\nMaintainable with positioning, suctioning\\nUnmaintainable, requires assistance\\nBREATHING\\nRate\\nMechanics\\n•\\t Retractions\\n•\\t Grunting\\n•\\t Use\\tof \\taccessory \\tmuscles\\n•\\t Nasal\\tflaring\\nAir movement\\n•\\t Chest\\texpansion\\n•\\t Breath\\tsounds\\n•\\t Stridor\\n•\\t Wheezing\\n•\\t Paradoxical\\tchest \\tmotion\\nColor\\nCIRCULATION\\nHeart rate\\nPeripheral and central pulses\\n•\\t Present/absent\\n•\\t Volume/strength\\nSkin\\tperfusion\\n•\\t Capillary\\trefill \\ttime\\n•\\t Skin\\ttemperature\\n•\\t Color\\n•\\t Mottling\\nBlood pressure\\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PERFUSION\\nResponsiveness\\t(AVPU)\\nRecognition\\tof \\tparents \\tor \\tcaregivers\\nPupillary response to light\\nPosturing\\nAVPU, Alert, responds to voice, responds to pain, unresponsive.\\nTABLE 38.2 Warning Signs and Symptoms Suggesting \\nthe Need for Resuscitation*\\nSYSTEM SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\\nCentral nervous \\nsystem\\nLethargy, agitation, delirium, obtundation, \\nconfusion\\nRespiratory Apnea,\\tgrunting, \\tnasal \\tflaring, \\tdyspnea, \\t\\nretracting, tachypnea, poor air movement, \\nstridor,\\twheezing\\nCardiovascular Arrhythmia, bradycardia, tachycardia, weak \\npulses,\\tpoor \\tcapillary \\trefill, \\thypotension\\nSkin and mucous \\nmembranes\\nMottling, pallor, cyanosis, diaphoresis, poor \\nmembrane turgor, dry mucous membranes\\n*Action would seldom be taken if only one or two of these signs and symptoms \\nwere present, but the occurrence of several in concert foreshadows grave \\nconsequences.

For this reason, the \\nrecommendation is to start chest compressions first while \\npreparing for ventilation.\\nFor optimal chest compressions, the child should be supine \\non a flat, hard surface. Effective CPR requires a compression \\ndepth of one-third to one-half of the anterior-posterior diameter \\nof the chest with complete recoil after each compression. The \\ncompression rate should be at least 100/min with breaths \\ndelivered 8-10 times/min. If an advanced airway is in place, \\ncompressions should not pause for ventilation; both should \\ncontinue simultaneously.\\nAirway\\nVentilation requires a patent airway. In children, airway patency \\noften is compromised by a loss of muscle tone, allowing the \\nmandibular block of tissue, including the tongue, bony mandible, \\nand the soft surrounding tissues, to rest against the posterior \\npharyngeal wall. The head tilt–chin lift maneuver should be \\nused to open the airway in children with no sign of head or \\nneck trauma. In children with signs of head or neck trauma, \\nthe jaw thrust maneuver should be used.\\nBag-mask ventilation can be as effective as, and possibly \\nsafer than, endotracheal intubation for short periods of time \\nin an out-of-hospital setting. If skilled personnel and proper \\nequipment are available, pediatric patients requiring resuscita-\\ntion should be endotracheally intubated. Before intubation, \\nthe patient should be ventilated with 100% oxygen using a \\nbag and mask. Cricoid pressure should be used to minimize \\ninflation of the stomach. Many conscious patients may \\nbenefit from the use of induction medications (sedatives, \\nanalgesics, and paralytics) to assist intubation, but caution is \\nnecessary to prevent further cardiovascular compromise from \\nvasodilating effects of many sedatives. The correct size of the \\ntube may be estimated according to the size of the child’s \\nmid-fifth phalanx or the following formula: 4 + (patient age  \\nin years/4).\\nWhen the endotracheal tube is in place, the adequacy of \\nventilation and the position of the tube must be assessed. \\nUse of both clinical assessment and confirmatory devices is \\nrecommended. Clinical assessment may include looking for \\nadequate chest wall movement and auscultation of the chest \\nto detect bilateral and symmetric breath sounds. Confirmatory \\ndevices, such as end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring \\ndevices, are useful for the validation of endotracheal place -\\nment, but low levels of detected CO 2 may be seen secondary \\nto lack of pulmonary circulation. If the patient’s condition fails \\nto improve or deteriorates, consider the possibilities of tube \\nDisplacement or Obstruction, Pneumothorax, or Equipment \\nfailure (mnemonic DOPE).\\nBreathing\\nThe major role of endotracheal intubation is to protect or \\nmaintain the airway and ensure the delivery of adequate oxygen \\nto the patient. Because hypoxemia is the final common pathway \\nin pediatric cardiopulmonary arrests, providing oxygen is more \\nimportant than correcting the respiratory acidosis. The clinician \\nshould deliver 100% oxygen at a rate of 8-10 breaths/min during \\nCPR, or 12-20 breaths/min for a patient who has a perfusing \\noxygen saturation, central venous pressure, and regional oxygen \\nsaturations helps guide therapy.\\nCARDIOPULMONARY ARREST\\nThe outcome of cardiopulmonary arrest in children is poor; \\nsurvival to hospital discharge is about 6% for out-of-hospital \\narrest and about 27% for in-hospital arrest, with most survivors \\nhaving some degree of permanent neurological disability. The \\nability to anticipate or recognize precardiopulmonary arrest \\nconditions and initiate prompt and appropriate therapy is not \\nonly lifesaving but also preserves the quality of life (see  \\nTable 38.2).\\nChildren who need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \\nusually have a primary respiratory arrest. Hypoxia usually \\ninitiates the cascade leading to arrest and also produces organ \\ndysfunction or damage (Table 38.3). The approach to cardio-\\npulmonary arrest extends beyond CPR and includes efforts \\nto preserve vital organ function. The goal in resuscitating a \\npediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should \\nbe to optimize cardiac output  and tissue oxygen delivery, \\nwhich may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation \\nand chest compression, and by the judicious administration \\nof pharmacological agents.\\nPediatric Advanced Life Support and \\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation\\nIn 2010, the American Heart Association revised the recom -\\nmendations for resuscitation of adults, children, and infants. \\nThe biggest change was the recommendation to start chest \\ncompressions immediately, rather than beginning with airway \\nand breathing (C[compressions]-A[airway]-B[breathing/\\nventilation]).\\nCirculation\\nChest compressions should be initiated if a pulse cannot be \\npalpated or if the heart rate is less than 60 beats/min with \\nconcurrent signs of poor systemic perfusion.

Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation \\ndevelops in 7-21% of patients hospitalized for respiratory \\nsyncytial virus.\\nAsthma is increasing in prevalence and is the most common \\nreason for unplanned hospital admissions in children 3-12 years \\nof age in the United States. Environmental factors (exposure \\nto cigarette smoke) and prior disease characteristics (severity \\nof asthma, exercise intolerance, delayed start of therapy, and \\nprevious intensive care unit admissions) affect hospitalization \\nand near-fatal episodes. The mortality rate of asthma for children \\nyounger than 19 years of age has increased by nearly 80% since \\n1980. Deaths are more common in African American children.\\nChronic respiratory failure (with acute exacerbations) is often \\ndue to chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic \\nfibrosis), neurological or neuromuscular abnormalities, and \\ncongenital anomalies.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nEarly signs of hypoxic respiratory failure include tachypnea \\nand tachycardia in an attempt to improve minute ventilation \\nand cardiac output and to maintain delivery of oxygenated \\nblood to the tissues. Further progression of disease may result \\nin dyspnea, nasal flaring, grunting, use of accessory muscles \\nof respiration, and diaphoresis. Late signs of inadequate oxygen \\ndelivery include cyanosis and altered mental status (initially \\nconfusion and agitation). Signs and symptoms of hypercarbic \\nrespiratory failure include attempts to increase minute ventilation \\n(tachypnea and increased depth of breathing) and altered mental \\nstatus (somnolence).\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nA chest radiograph may show evidence of the etiology of \\nrespiratory failure. The detection of atelectasis, hyperinflation, \\ndefibrillation and resume immediately afterward, minimizing \\ninterruptions in compressions. If a second attempt at defibrilla-\\ntion is necessary, it should be followed by a dose of epinephrine. \\nChildren failing two episodes of defibrillation may benefit from \\nadministration of amiodarone. Defibrillation should be distin-\\nguished from cardioversion of supraventricular tachycardias, \\nwhich also may compromise cardiac output. Cardioversion \\nrequires a lower starting dose and synchronization of the \\ndischarge to the electrocardiogram to prevent discharging \\nduring a susceptible period, which may convert supraventricular \\ntachycardia to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.\\nCHAPTER 39 \\nRespiratory Failure\\nETIOLOGY\\nAcute respiratory failure occurs when the pulmonary system  \\nis unable to maintain adequate gas exchange to meet metabolic \\ndemands. The resulting failure can be classified as hyper-\\ncarbic (Pa CO2 >50 mm  H g in previously healthy children),  \\nhypoxemic (PaO2 <60 mm  H g in previously healthy children \\nwithout an intracardiac shunt), or both. Hypoxemic respiratory \\nfailure is frequently caused by ventilation-perfusion mismatch \\n(perfusion of lung that is not adequately ventilated) and shunting \\n(deoxygenated blood bypasses ventilated alveoli). Hypercarbic \\nrespiratory failure results from inadequate alveolar ventila -\\ntion secondary to decreased minute ventilation (tidal volume \\n× respiratory rate) or an increase in dead space ventilation \\n(ventilation of areas receiving no perfusion).\\nRespiratory failure may occur with acute respiratory distress \\nsyndrome (ARDS). The pediatric-specific definition for acute \\nrespiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) builds on the adult-\\nbased Berlin Definition, but has been modified to account for \\ndifferences between adults and children with ARDS. Pediatric \\nARDS, and its severity, is defined by (1) timing: onset within \\n7 days of known clinical insult; (2) respiratory failure not fully \\nexplained by cardiac failure or fluid overload; (3) chest imaging \\nfindings of new infiltrate(s) consistent with acute pulmonary \\nparenchymal disease; and (4) impairment in oxygenation (as \\ndescribed in Table 39.1). Pediatric ARDS can be triggered by \\na variety of insults, including sepsis, pneumonia, shock, burns, \\nor traumatic injury, all resulting in inflammation and increased \\nTABLE 39.1 Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Severity Based on Oxygenation\\nNONINVASIVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION INVASIVE MECHANICAL VENTILATION\\nPARDS (no severity stratification) PARDS (severity per OI or OSI)\\nFull\\tface \\tmask: \\tbi-level \\tpositive \\tairway \\tpressure \\tor \\t\\ncontinuous positive airway pressure ≥ 5\\tH2O:\\n\\t PF \\tratio \\t≤300\\n\\t SF \\tratio \\t≤264\\nMild:\\t4 \\t≤ OI <\\t8; \\t5 \\t≤ OSI <\\t7.5\\nModerate:\\t8 \\t≤ OI <\\t16; \\t7.5 \\t≤ OSI <\\t12.3\\nSevere:\\tOI \\t>16;\\tOSI \\t≥12.3\\nPF ratio = Pa O2:FiO2; if PaO2 is not available, wean Fi O2 to maintain Sp O2 ≤97% to calculate the SF ratio = Sp O2: FiO2.\\nOI = oxygenation index = [FiO2 × mean airway pressure × 100]/PaO2; if PaO2 is not available, wean FiO2 to maintain SpO2 ≤97% to calculate the oxygen saturation index \\n(OSI; [FiO2 × mean airway pressure × 100]/Sp O2).\\nPARDS, Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.\\nModified from Khemani RG, Smith LS, Zimmerman JJ, Erickson S; Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference Group.

Delivery methods, including intubation and mechanical \\nventilation, should be escalated if there is an inability to increase \\noxygen saturation appropriately.\\nPatients presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure are \\noften hypoxic as well. When oxygenation is established, measures \\nshould be taken to address the underlying cause of hypercarbia. \\nPatients who are hypercarbic without signs of respiratory fatigue \\nor somnolence may not require intubation based on the Pco2 \\nalone; however, patients with marked increase in the work of \\nbreathing or inadequate respiratory effort may require assistance \\nwith ventilation.\\nAfter identification of the etiology of respiratory failure, \\nspecific interventions and treatments are tailored to the needs \\nof the patient. External support of oxygenation and ventila-\\ntion may be provided by noninvasive ventilation methods \\n(heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive \\nairway pressure, biphasic positive airway pressure, or negative \\npressure ventilation) or through invasive methods (traditional \\nmechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, \\nor extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Elimination of CO2 \\nis achieved through manipulation of minute ventilation (tidal \\nvolume and respiratory rate). Oxygenation is improved by alter-\\ning variables that affect oxygen delivery (fraction of inspired \\noxygen) or mean airway pressure (positive end-expiratory \\npressure [PEEP], peak inspiratory pressure, inspiratory time, \\ngas flow).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nThe major complication of hypoxic respiratory failure is the \\ndevelopment of organ dysfunction. Multiple organ dysfunction \\nincludes the development of two or more of the following: \\nrespiratory failure, cardiac failure, renal insufficiency/failure, \\ngastrointestinal or hepatic insufficiency, disseminated intra-\\nvascular coagulation, and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. \\nMortality rates increase with increasing numbers of involved \\norgans (see Table 38.3).\\nComplications associated with mechanical ventilation include \\npressure-related and volume-related lung injury. Both overdisten-\\ntion and insufficient lung distention (loss of functional residual \\ncapacity) are associated with lung injury. Pneumomediastinum \\nand pneumothorax are potential complications of the disease \\nprocess and overdistention. Inflammatory mediators may play \\na role in the development of chronic fibrotic lung diseases in \\nventilated patients.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nPrognosis varies with the etiology of respiratory failure. Less \\nthan 1% of previously healthy children with bronchiolitis die. \\nAsthma mortality rates, although still low, have increased. \\nPopulation-based studies report a variable mortality rate for \\npediatric ARDS from 18-35% depending on the study \\npopulation.\\nPREVENTION\\nPrevention strategies are explicit to the etiology of respiratory \\nfailure. Some infectious causes can be prevented through active \\nimmunization against organisms causing primary respiratory \\ndisease (pertussis, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type \\ninfiltrates, or pneumothoraces assists with ongoing management. \\nDiffuse infiltrates or pulmonary edema may suggest ARDS. \\nThe chest radiograph may be normal when upper airway \\nobstruction or impaired respiratory controls are the etiology. \\nIn patients presenting with stridor or other evidence of upper \\nairway obstruction, a lateral neck film or computed tomography \\n(CT) may delineate anatomical defects. Direct visualization \\nthrough flexible bronchoscopy allows the identification of \\ndynamic abnormalities of the anatomical airway. Helical CT \\nhelps diagnose a pulmonary embolus.\\nPulse oximetry allows noninvasive, continuous assessment \\nof oxygenation but is unable to provide information about \\nventilation abnormalities. Determination of CO2 levels requires \\na blood gas measurement (venous, capillary or arterial). An \\narterial blood gas is the gold standard for measurement of \\nserum CO2 levels and allows for analysis of the severity of \\noxygenation defect through calculation of an alveolar-arterial \\noxygen difference. A normal PaCO2 in a patient who is hyper -\\nventilating should heighten concern about the risk of further  \\ndeterioration.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nHypoxic respiratory failure resulting from impairment of \\nalveolar-capillary function is seen in ARDS; cardiogenic pul-\\nmonary edema; interstitial lung disease; aspiration pneumonia; \\nbronchiolitis; bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia; and sepsis. \\nIt also can be due to intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting \\nseen with atelectasis and embolism.\\nHypercarbic respiratory failure can occur when the respira-\\ntory center fails as a result of drug use (opioids, barbiturates, \\nanesthetic agents), neurological or neuromuscular junction \\nabnormalities (cervical spine trauma, demyelinating diseases, \\nanterior horn cell disease, botulism), chest wall injuries, or \\ndiseases that cause increased resistance to airflow (croup, \\nvocal cord paralysis, postextubation edema). Maintenance of \\nventilation requires adequate function of the chest wall and \\ndiaphragm. Disorders of the neuromuscular pathways, such as \\nmuscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and botulism, result in \\ninadequate chest wall movement, development of atelectasis, \\nand respiratory failure. Scoliosis rarely results in significant \\nchest deformity that leads to restrictive pulmonary function. \\nSimilar impairments of air exchange may result from distention \\nof the abdomen (postoperatively or due to ascites, obstruction, \\nor a mass) and thoracic trauma (flail chest).\\nMixed forms of respiratory failure are common and occur \\nwhen disease processes result in more than one pathophysi -\\nological change. Increased secretions seen in asthma often \\nlead to atelectasis and hypoxia, whereas restrictions of \\nexpiratory airflow may lead to hypercarbia. Progression to \\nrespiratory failure results from peripheral airway obstruction, \\nextensive atelectasis, and resultant hypoxemia and retention  \\nof CO2.\\nTREATMENT\\nInitial treatment of patients in respiratory distress includes \\naddressing the ABCs (see Chapter 38). Bag/mask ventilation \\nmust be initiated for patients with apnea. In other patients, \\noxygen therapy is administered using appropriate methods (e.g., \\nsimple mask).

Primary prevention of \\ntraumatic injuries may decrease the incidence of pediatric \\nARDS. Compliance with appropriate therapies for asthma may \\ndecrease the number of episodes of respiratory failure (see \\nChapter 78).\\nCHAPTER 40 \\nShock\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nShock is the inability to provide sufficient perfusion of oxygen-\\nated blood and substrate to tissues to meet metabolic demands. \\nOxygen delivery is directly related to the arterial oxygen content \\n(oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration) and to \\ncardiac output (stroke volume and heart rate). Changes in \\nmetabolic needs are met primarily by adjustments in cardiac \\noutput. Stroke volume is related to myocardial end-diastolic \\nfiber length (preload), myocardial contractility (inotropy), and \\nresistance of blood ejection from the ventricle (afterload; see \\nChapter 145). In a young infant whose myocardium possesses \\nrelatively less contractile tissue, increased demand for cardiac \\noutput is met primarily by a neurally mediated increase in \\nheart rate. In older children and adolescents, cardiac output is \\nmost efficiently augmented by increasing stroke volume through \\nneurohormonally mediated changes in vascular tone, resulting \\nin increased venous return to the heart (increased preload), \\ndecreased arterial resistance (decreased afterload), and increased \\nmyocardial contractility.\\nOnce the initial assessment of an acutely ill child is completed, \\nthe constellation of clinical characteristics can suggest one of \\nthe five broad classifications of shock: hypovolemic, distributive, \\ncardiogenic, obstructive, and dissociative.\\nHYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK\\nAcute hypovolemia is the most common cause of shock in \\nchildren. It results from loss of fluid from the intravascular \\nspace secondary to inadequate intake or excessive losses \\n(vomiting and diarrhea, blood loss, capillary leak syndromes, \\nor pathological renal fluid losses) (Table 40.1). Reduced blood \\nvolume decreases preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output. \\nHypovolemic shock results in increased sympathoadrenal \\nactivity, producing an increased heart rate and enhanced \\nmyocardial contractility. Neurohormonally mediated constric-\\ntion of the arterioles and capacitance vessels maintains blood \\npressure, augments venous return to the heart to improve \\npreload, and redistributes blood flow from nonvital to vital \\norgans. If hypovolemic shock remains untreated, the increased \\nheart rate may impair coronary blood flow and ventricular \\nfilling, while elevated systemic vascular resistance increases \\nmyocardial oxygen consumption, resulting in worsening \\nmyocardial function. Ultimately, intense systemic vasoconstric-\\ntion and hypovolemia produce tissue ischemia, impairing cell \\nmetabolism and releasing potent vasoactive mediators from \\ninjured cells. Cytokines and other vasoactive peptides can \\nTABLE 40.1 Classification of Shock and Common \\nUnderlying Causes\\nTYPE\\nPRIMARY \\nCIRCULATORY \\nDERANGEMENTCOMMON CAUSES\\nHypovolemic Decreased \\ncirculating blood \\nvolume\\nHemorrhage\\nDiarrhea\\nDiabetes insipidus, \\ndiabetes mellitus\\nBurns\\nAdrenogenital syndrome\\nCapillary leak\\nDistributive Vasodilation\\t→ \\nvenous pooling → \\ndecreased preload\\nSepsis\\nMaldistribution\\tof \\t\\nregional blood \\nflow\\nAnaphylaxis\\nCNS/spinal\\tinjury\\nDrug\\tintoxication\\nCardiogenic Decreased \\nmyocardial \\ncontractility\\nCongenital heart disease\\nArrhythmia\\nHypoxic/ischemic\\tinjuries\\nCardiomyopathy\\nMetabolic derangements\\nMyocarditis\\nDrug\\tintoxication\\nKawasaki disease\\nObstructive Mechanical \\nobstruction to \\nventricular\\tfilling \\t\\nor\\toutflow\\nCardiac tamponade\\nMassive pulmonary \\nembolus\\nTension\\tpneumothorax\\nCardiac tumor\\nDissociative Oxygen\\tnot \\t\\nappropriately \\nbound or released \\nfrom\\themoglobin\\nCarbon\\tmonoxide \\t\\npoisoning\\nMethemoglobinemia\\nCNS, Central nervous system.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The prognosis is good, with a low mortality in \\nuncomplicated cases.\\nDistributive Shock\\nPatients with distributive shock usually have tachycardia and \\nalterations of peripheral perfusion. In early stages, when cytokine \\nrelease results in vasodilation, pulses may be bounding and \\nvital organ function may be maintained (an alert patient, with \\nrapid capillary refill and some urine output in warm shock). \\nAs the disease progresses untreated, extremities become cool \\nand mottled with a delayed capillary refill time. At this stage, \\nthe patient has hypotension and vasoconstriction. If the etiology \\nof distributive shock is sepsis, the patient often has fever, lethargy, \\npetechiae, or purpura, and he or she may have an identifiable \\nsource of infection.\\nCardiogenic Shock\\nCardiogenic shock results when the myocardium is unable to \\nsupply the cardiac output required to support tissue perfusion \\nand organ function. Because of this self-perpetuating cycle, \\nheart failure progressing to death may be rapid. Patients with \\ncardiogenic shock have tachycardia and tachypnea. The liver \\nis usually enlarged, a gallop is often present, and jugular venous \\ndistention may be noted. Because renal blood flow is poor, \\nsodium and water are retained, resulting in oliguria and \\nperipheral edema.\\nObstructive Shock\\nRestriction of cardiac output results in an increase in heart \\nrate and an alteration of stroke volume. The pulse pressure is \\nnarrow (making pulses harder to feel), and capillary refill is \\ndelayed. The liver is often enlarged, and jugular venous distention \\nmay be evident.\\nDissociative Shock\\nThe principal abnormality in dissociative shock is the inability \\nto deliver oxygen to tissues. Symptoms include tachycardia, \\ntachypnea, alterations in mental status, and, ultimately, cardio-\\nvascular collapse.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nShock requires immediate resuscitation before obtaining \\nlaboratory or diagnostic studies. Following initial stabilization \\n(including glucose administration if hypoglycemia is present), \\nthe type of shock dictates the necessary laboratory studies. All \\npatients with shock may benefit from the determination of a \\nbaseline arterial blood gas and blood lactate level to assess \\nthe impairment of tissue oxygenation. Measurement of central \\nmixed venous oxygen saturation aids in the assessment of the \\nadequacy of oxygen delivery. In contrast to other forms of shock, \\npatients with sepsis often have high mixed venous saturation \\nvalues because of impairment of mitochondrial function and \\ninability of tissues to extract oxygen. A complete blood count can \\npotentially assess intravascular blood volume after equilibration \\nfollowing a hemorrhage. Electrolyte measurements in patients \\nwith hypovolemic shock may identify abnormalities from losses. \\nmm3, less than 4,000 cells/mm 3, or has greater than 10%  \\nimmature forms.\\nCARDIOGENIC SHOCK\\nCardiogenic shock is caused by an abnormality in myocardial \\nfunction and is expressed as depressed myocardial contractility \\nand cardiac output with poor tissue perfusion. Compensatory \\nmechanisms may contribute to the progression of shock by \\ndepressing cardiac function further. Neurohormonal vasocon-\\nstrictor responses increase afterload and add to the work of \\nthe failing ventricle. Tachycardia may impair coronary blood \\nflow, which decreases myocardial oxygen delivery. Increased \\ncentral blood volume caused by sodium and water retention \\nand by incomplete emptying of the ventricles during systole \\nresults in elevated left ventricular volume and pressure, which \\nimpair subendocardial blood flow. As compensatory mechanisms \\nare overcome, the failing left ventricle produces increased \\nventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, which leads to \\nincreased left atrial pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema. \\nThis sequence also contributes to right ventricular failure because \\nof increased pulmonary artery pressure and increased right \\nventricular afterload.\\nPrimary cardiogenic shock may occur in children who have \\ncongenital heart disease. Cardiogenic shock also may occur \\nin previously healthy children secondary to viral myocarditis, \\ndysrhythmias, or toxic or metabolic abnormalities or after \\nhypoxic-ischemic injury (see Chapters 142, 145, and 147, as \\nwell as Table 40.1).\\nOBSTRUCTIVE SHOCK\\nObstructive shock results from mechanical obstruction of \\nventricular outflow. Causes include congenital lesions, such as \\ncoarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch, and severe \\naortic valvular stenosis, along with acquired diseases (e.g., \\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy) (see Table 40.1). For neonates \\npresenting in shock, obstructive lesions must be considered.\\nDISSOCIATIVE SHOCK\\nDissociative shock refers to conditions in which tissue perfusion \\nis normal, but cells are unable to use oxygen because the \\nhemoglobin has an abnormal affinity for oxygen, preventing \\nits release to the tissues (see Table 40.1).\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAll forms of shock produce evidence that tissue perfusion and \\noxygenation are insufficient (increased heart rate, abnormal \\nblood pressure, alterations of peripheral pulses). The etiology \\nof shock may alter the initial presentation of these signs and \\nsymptoms.\\nHypovolemic Shock\\nHypovolemic shock is distinguished from other causes of shock \\nby history and the absence of signs of heart failure or sepsis. \\nIn addition to the signs of sympathoadrenal activity (tachycardia, \\nvasoconstriction), clinical manifestations include signs of \\ndehydration (dry mucous membranes, decreased urine output) \\nor blood loss (pallor).

In cardiogenic shock, an elevated preload contributes \\nto pulmonary edema.\\nSelection of fluids for resuscitation and ongoing use is \\ndictated by clinical circumstances. Crystalloid volume expand-\\ners are generally recommended as initial choices because \\nthey are effective and inexpensive. Most acutely ill children \\nwith signs of shock may safely receive, and usually benefit \\ngreatly from, rapid administration of a 20-mL/kg bolus of an \\nisotonic crystalloid. This dose may be repeated until a response \\nis noted. Colloids contain larger molecules that may stay in \\nthe intravascular space longer than crystalloid solutions and \\nexert oncotic pressure, drawing fluid out of the tissues into \\nthe vascular compartment. However, the long-term risks of \\ncolloids may exceed the benefits. Care must be exercised in \\ntreating cardiogenic shock with volume expansion because the \\nventricular filling pressures may rise without improvement or \\nwith deterioration of cardiac performance. Carefully monitoring \\ncardiac output or central venous pressure guides safe volume  \\nreplacement.\\nCardiovascular Support\\nIn an effort to improve cardiac output after volume resuscitation, \\nor when further volume replacement may be dangerous, a \\nvariety of inotropic and vasodilator drugs may be useful (Table \\n40.2). Therapy is directed first at increasing myocardial con-\\ntractility, then at decreasing left ventricular afterload. The \\nhemodynamic status of the patient dictates the choice of  \\nthe agent.\\nTherapy may be initiated with dopamine at 5-20  µg/kg \\nper minute; however, epinephrine or norepinephrine may be \\npreferable in patients with decompensated shock. In addition to \\nimproving contractility, certain catecholamines cause an increase \\nin systemic vascular resistance. The addition of a vasodilator \\ndrug may improve cardiac performance by decreasing the \\nresistance against which the heart must pump (afterload). \\nAfterload reduction may be achieved with dobutamine, mil-\\nrinone, amrinone, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, and angiotensin-\\nconverting enzyme inhibitors. The use of these drugs may be \\nparticularly important in late shock, when vasoconstriction is  \\nprominent.\\nRespiratory Support\\nThe lung is a target organ for inflammatory mediators in \\nshock and SIRS. Respiratory failure may develop rapidly \\nand become progressive. Intervention requires endotracheal \\nintubation and mechanical ventilation accompanied by the use \\nof supplemental oxygen and PEEP . Care must be taken with \\nthe process of intubation because a child with compensated \\nPatients presenting in distributive shock require appropriate \\nbacterial and viral cultures to identify a cause of infection. If \\ncardiogenic or obstructive shock is suspected, an echocardiogram \\nassists with the diagnosis and, in the case of tamponade, assists \\nwith placement of a pericardial drain to relieve the fluid. Patients \\nwith dissociative shock require detection of the causative agent \\n(carbon monoxide, methemoglobin). The management of shock \\nalso requires monitoring of arterial blood gases for oxygenation, \\nventilation (CO2), and acidosis and frequently assessing the \\nlevels of serum electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, \\nand blood urea nitrogen (BUN).\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nSee Table 40.1.\\nTREATMENT\\nGeneral Principles\\nThe key to therapy is the recognition of shock in its early, \\npartially compensated state, when many of the hemodynamic \\nand metabolic alterations may be reversible. Initial therapy for \\nshock follows the ABCs of resuscitation. Later therapy can then \\nbe directed at the underlying cause. Therapy should minimize \\ncardiopulmonary work, while ensuring cardiac output, blood \\npressure, and gas exchange. Intubation, combined with mechani-\\ncal ventilation with oxygen supplementation, improves oxy-\\ngenation and decreases or eliminates the work of breathing but \\nmay impede venous return if distending airway pressures \\n(positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] or peak inspiratory \\npressure) are excessive. Blood pressure support is crucial because \\nthe vasodilation in sepsis may reduce perfusion despite supra-\\nnormal cardiac output.\\nMonitoring a child in shock requires maintaining access to \\nthe arterial and central venous circulation to record pressure \\nmeasurements, perform blood sampling, and measure systemic \\nblood pressure continuously. These measurements facilitate \\nthe estimation of preload and afterload. Regional monitoring \\nwith near infrared spectroscopy may allow early, noninvasive \\ndetection of alterations in perfusion.\\nOrgan-Directed Therapeutics\\nFluid Resuscitation\\nAlterations in preload have a dramatic effect on cardiac output. \\nIn hypovolemic and distributive shock, decreased preload \\nsignificantly impairs cardiac output.

In the United States, between 2009 and 2015, \\nthe unintentional injury death rate for children younger than \\n19 years of age declined by 12% (from 11.0 to 9.7 per 100,000). \\nThis decline has been attributed to increased use of child safety \\nseats and seat belts, reduction in drunk driving, increased use \\nof child-resistant packaging, enhanced safety awareness, and \\nimproved medical care.\\nThe most common causes of fatal injuries differ among \\nage groups. For instance, suffocation is the most common \\ntype of fatal injury among infants (83% in 2012); however, it \\naccounts for only 1% of unintentional fatalities among 15-19 \\nyear olds. Conversely, motor vehicle collisions account for 6% \\nof fatal injuries among infants, whereas they account for 66% of \\nadolescent fatal injuries. Drowning is the most common cause \\nof fatal injury among children ages 1-4 years (31%), while it \\naccounts for 7% of fatal injuries among adolescents. Notably, \\ndifferences in geography, climate, population density (access \\nto care), and population traits affect the frequency, etiology, \\nand severity of these injuries.\\nInjury occurs through interaction of the host (child) with the \\nagent (e.g., car and driver) through a vector and an environment \\n(e.g., roadways, weather) that is conducive to exposure. The \\nage of the child may determine the exposure to various agents \\nand environments. For example, most injuries in infants and \\ntoddlers occur in the home as the result of exposure to agents \\nfound there (water heaters, bathtubs, soft bedding). Gender \\naffects exposure to injury, with boys having a fatal injury rate \\ngreater than that of girls.\\nEDUCATION FOR PREVENTING INJURIES\\nThe recognition that much of the morbidity and mortality \\nare determined at the scene of an injury has stimulated the \\ndevelopment of prevention measures. The Haddon matrix \\ncombines the epidemiological components (host, agent, physical \\nand social environments) with time factors (before, during, \\nand after the event) to identify effective interventions focused \\non different aspects of the injury event. Primary strategies \\n(preventing the event), secondary strategies (minimizing \\nthe severity of injury), and tertiary strategies (minimizing \\nlong-term impact) can be targeted for each epidemiological \\ncomponent. Such strategies typically fall into one of three \\nareas: education, enforcement, and environment (including  \\nengineering).\\nEducation is often the first strategy considered, but it requires \\nbehavioral change and action on the part of people. Most \\neducational strategies are not well evaluated.\\nDespite the reliance on an action by the individuals involved, \\nsome active strategies benefit from enforcement. Children \\nshock may suddenly decompensate on administration of \\nsedative medications that reduce systemic vascular resistance. \\nSevere cardiopulmonary failure may be managed with inhaled \\nnitric oxide and, if necessary, extracorporeal membrane  \\noxygenation.\\nRenal Salvage\\nPoor cardiac output accompanied by decreased renal blood \\nflow may cause prerenal azotemia and oliguria/anuria. Severe \\nhypotension may produce acute tubular necrosis  and acute \\nrenal failure. Prerenal azotemia is corrected when blood volume \\ndeficits are replaced or myocardial contractility is improved, \\nbut acute tubular necrosis does not improve immediately when \\nshock is corrected. Prerenal azotemia is associated with a serum \\nBUN-to-creatinine ratio of greater than 10 :  1 a nd a urine sodium \\nlevel less than 20  mE q/L; acute tubular necrosis has a BUN-\\nto-creatinine ratio of 10  :  1 o r less and a urine sodium level \\nbetween 40 and 60 mE q/L (see Chapter 165). Aggressive fluid \\nreplacement is often necessary to improve oliguria associated \\nwith prerenal azotemia. Because the management of shock \\nrequires administering large volumes of fluid, maintaining urine \\noutput greatly facilitates patient management.\\nPrevention of acute tubular necrosis and the subsequent \\ncomplications associated with acute renal failure (hyperkalemia, \\nacidosis, hypocalcemia, fluid overload) is important. The use of \\npharmacological agents to augment urine output is indicated \\nwhen the intravascular volume has been replaced. The use of \\nloop diuretics, such as furosemide, or combinations of a loop \\ndiuretic and a thiazide agent may enhance urine output. Infusion \\nof low-dose dopamine, which produces renal artery vasodilation, \\nalso may improve urine output. Nevertheless, if hyperkalemia, \\nrefractory acidosis, hypervolemia, or altered mental status \\nassociated with uremia occurs, dialysis or hemofiltration should \\nbe initiated.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nShock results in impairment of tissue perfusion and oxygenation \\nand activation of inflammation and cytokine pathways. The \\nmajor complication of shock is multiple organ system failure, \\ndefined as the dysfunction of more than one organ, including \\nrespiratory failure, renal failure, liver dysfunction, coagulation \\nabnormalities, or cerebral dysfunction. Patients with shock and \\nmultiple organ failure have a higher mortality rate and, for \\nsurvivors, a longer hospital stay.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nEarly recognition and goal-directed intervention in patients \\nwith shock improve survival. However, delays in treatment of \\nhypotension increase the incidence of multiple organ failure \\nand mortality. Goal-directed therapy focused on maintaining \\nmixed venous oxygen saturation may improve survival.\\nPREVENTION\\nPrevention strategies for shock are focused, for the most part, \\non shock associated with sepsis and hypovolemia. Some forms \\nof septic shock can be prevented through the use of immuniza-\\ntions (Haemophilus influenzae type b, meningococcal, pneu -\\nmococcal vaccines).

The initial assessment of a seriously injured child \\nshould involve a systematic approach, including a primary \\nsurvey, resuscitation, secondary survey, post-resuscitation \\nmonitoring, and definitive care. The primary survey focuses \\non the ABCDEs of emergency care, as modified for trauma \\nfrom the ABCs of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (see  \\nChapter 38). The assessment of the airway and breathing \\ncomponents should include control of the cervical spine \\n(especially if the patient has an altered mental status), evalu-\\nation for injuries that could impair air entry or gas exchange, \\nand consideration of the likelihood of a full stomach (risk \\nof aspiration pneumonia). Circulation can be assessed via \\nobservation (heart rate, skin color, mental status) and palpation \\n(pulse quality, capillary refill, skin temperature) and restored \\n(via two large peripheral intravenous lines, when possible) \\nwhile control of bleeding is accomplished through the use \\nof direct pressure. Assessment for disabilities (D), including \\nneurologic status, includes examination of pupil size and reactiv-\\nity, a brief mental status assessment (A VPU—alert; responds \\nto voice; responds to pain; unresponsive), and examination \\nof extremity movement to assess for spinal cord injury. The \\nGlasgow Coma Scale can direct decisions regarding the \\ninitiation of cerebral resuscitation in patients with suspected \\nclosed head injuries (Table 42.1).

Suspicion of a splenic injury should be heightened \\nif there are left upper quadrant abrasions or tenderness. A \\npositive Kehr sign (pressure on the left upper quadrant eliciting \\nleft shoulder pain) is due to diaphragmatic irritation by the \\nruptured spleen and strongly suggests splenic injury. CT scans \\nare used to identify and grade splenic injury.\\nNonoperative management is the treatment of choice for most \\nserious splenic injuries unless there is continued large blood \\nloss or hemodynamic instability. If a splenectomy is performed, \\npatients should receive penicillin prophylaxis and should receive \\npneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines to decrease \\nthe increased risk of overwhelming sepsis.\\nLiver Trauma\\nMajor trauma to the liver is a serious cause of morbidity. Severe \\nhemorrhage is more common in patients with liver injury than \\nwith other abdominal injuries because of its dual blood supply. \\nWithout significant vascular injury, hepatic injury presents and \\nbehaves clinically like a splenic injury. Nonoperative manage-\\nment is recommended but requires close clinical observation \\nfor signs of ongoing blood loss or hemodynamic instability. \\nAs with splenic injury, there is a grading system based on the \\npattern of injury.\\nRenal Injury\\nThe kidney is less frequently injured than the liver or spleen, \\nand when injured it is often associated with other injuries. A \\nyoung child’s kidney is more vulnerable to trauma than an adult’s \\nbecause of a more compliant rib cage and relatively immature \\nabdominal muscle development. The diagnosis of renal injury \\nis based on history and physical examination coupled with \\nurinalysis showing blood and increased protein levels. An \\nultrasound or CT may also be useful. Low-grade renal injury \\nis usually managed conservatively, with bed rest, catheter drainage, \\nand monitoring for resolution of the injury by ultrasound or \\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS  \\nAND TREATMENT\\nHead injuries and injuries to the limbs are the most common. \\nMultiple organ involvement is also common, and penetrating \\ntrauma is becoming more frequent. After the initial evaluation \\nand stabilization, the team focuses on the involved organ systems.\\nHead Trauma\\nSee Chapter 184.\\nSpinal Cord Trauma\\nAlthough spinal cord injury is not common in pediatric trauma \\npatients, it is potentially devastating when it occurs. Cervical \\nspine immobilization should be maintained until a spinal cord \\ninjury is ruled out. Cervical spine radiographs are not sufficient \\nto rule out a spinal cord injury because the immature vertebral \\ncolumn in children may allow stretching of the cord or nerve \\nroots with no radiological abnormality (spinal cord injury \\nwithout radiological abnormality [SCIWORA]). SCIWORA \\nmay occur in a significant percentage of children with a spinal \\ncord injury; when it is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging \\nshould be performed.\\nThoracic Trauma\\nThoracic injury is the second leading cause of trauma death. \\nPulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, and rib fractures occur \\nmost commonly, and patients may present without external \\nsigns of trauma. Patients with pulmonary parenchymal injury \\nshould receive supportive treatment to ensure adequate oxy-\\ngenation and ventilation. Most pediatric blunt thoracic injuries \\ncan be managed without surgery. Injury to the heart and great \\nvessels is rare but requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. \\nTABLE 42.2 Initial Laboratory Evaluation of the Major \\nTrauma Patient\\nHEMATOLOGY\\nComplete blood count\\nPlatelet count\\nType and cross match\\nURINALYSIS\\nGross\\nMicroscopic\\nCLINICAL CHEMISTRY\\nAmylase/lipase\\nAspartate\\taminotransferase/alanine \\taminotransferase\\nRADIOLOGY\\nCervical\\tspine \\tfilms\\nAnteroposterior chest radiograph\\nRadiographs\\tof \\tall \\tapparent \\tfractures\\nComputed\\ttomography \\tscans \\twhere \\tindicated \\tfor \\thead, \\tchest, \\t\\nand abdominal trauma\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Outcomes may be \\ncategorized as death, morbidity, or no morbidity. Other terms \\nsuch as near drowning, secondary drowning, or dry drowning \\nshould be abandoned.\\nInitially, submersion or immersion results in aspiration of \\nsmall amounts of fluid into the larynx, triggering breath holding \\nor laryngospasm. In many cases, the laryngospasm resolves, \\nand larger volumes of water or gastric contents are aspirated \\ninto the lungs, destroying surfactant and causing alveolitis and \\ndysfunction of the alveolar-capillary gas exchange. The resulting \\nhypoxemia leads to hypoxic brain injury that is exacerbated \\nby ischemic injury after circulatory collapse.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nDrowning deaths overall have decreased; however, drowning \\nis still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and is the \\nsecond leading cause of injury death for children ages 1-14 \\nyears. Boys are four times more likely than girls to drown. The \\nmost common location of drowning varies by age, with drowning \\nin natural bodies of water becoming more frequent in older \\nage groups.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nHypoxemia is the result of laryngospasm and aspiration \\nduring drowning. Victims may also develop respiratory dis-\\ntress secondary to pulmonary endothelial injury, increased \\ncapillary permeability, and destruction of surfactant. Clinical \\nmanifestations include tachypnea, tachycardia, increased work \\nof breathing, and decreased breath sounds with or without \\ncrackles. The hypoxic-ischemic injury that may occur can lead \\nto depressed myocardial function resulting in tachycardia, \\nimpaired perfusion, and, potentially, cardiovascular collapse. \\nAfter resuscitation, acute respiratory distress syndrome is \\ncommon. Altered mental status may be present and requires \\nfrequent monitoring of neurological status. Following submer-\\nsion in cold water, hypothermia may result in relative brady -\\ncardia and hypotension and place the child at risk for cardiac  \\ndysrhythmias.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nAfter resuscitation, arterial blood gas measurement assists in \\nassessing pulmonary gas exchange. A chemistry profile may \\nreveal elevated liver enzymes if hypoxemia and ischemia were of \\nlong duration and provide baseline renal functions. Electrolytes \\nare often obtained, although alterations of serum electrolytes \\nare minimal, even in freshwater drowning.\\nTREATMENT\\nResuscitation of a drowning victim includes the basic ABCs \\n(see Chapter 38). Victims of unwitnessed drowning require \\nCT. Surgery may be required for falling hemoglobin levels, \\nrefractory shock, or urinary obstruction caused by clots.\\nPancreatic Injury\\nInjuries of the pancreas are less common in children than in \\nadults but are seen in bicycle handlebar injuries, motor vehicle \\ncrashes, and nonaccidental trauma. The diagnosis is difficult \\nunless there is obvious injury to overlying structures, such as \\nthe stomach or duodenum. Diffuse abdominal tenderness, pain, \\nand vomiting may be accompanied by elevations of amylase \\nand lipase but may not occur until several days after the injury. \\nHemodynamic instability secondary to retroperitoneal hemor-\\nrhage may be the presenting sign. Abdominal CT is useful but \\nmay not be sufficient to evaluate ductal injury. Nonoperative \\nmanagement is appropriate for contusions, but surgical interven-\\ntion may be required in patients with ductal injuries. Drainage \\nof pseudocysts, in patients who develop them, may be required \\nif they are unresponsive to bowel rest and parenteral nutrition.\\nIntestinal Injury\\nInjury to the intestine occurs less frequently than injury to \\nsolid intraabdominal organs and varies with the amount of \\nintestinal contents. A full bowel is likely to shear more easily \\nthan an empty bowel. Shearing occurs at points of fixation (the \\nligament of Treitz, the ileocecal valve, and the ascending and \\ndescending peritoneal reflections). Pneumoperitoneum should \\nprompt surgical exploration. Serial physical examinations are \\nuseful when the clinical picture is uncertain.\\nDuodenal hematoma can occur in the absence of perforation. \\nDuodenal hematomas result from blunt injury to the abdomen. \\nAffected patients often present with persistent pain and bilious \\nemesis. Most hematomas respond to nonoperative management \\nwith gastric decompression and parenteral nutrition.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nPatients requiring hospitalization for multiple trauma are at \\nrisk for a variety of complications based on the type and severity \\nof injury. Sepsis and multiple organ failure may occur in children \\nwith multiple trauma. Delays in enteral nutrition because of \\nan ileus may further increase the risk of sepsis secondary to \\ntranslocation of bacteria across the intestinal mucosa.\\nRenal failure secondary to myoglobinuria may be seen in \\nchildren who sustain crushing or electrical injuries and burns. \\nDeep venous thrombosis is less common in the pediatric popula-\\ntion, but prophylaxis for children who will be immobilized \\nbecause of injury should be provided.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nUnintentional injury is the leading cause of death for children \\naged 1-18; however, many of these deaths occur in the field \\nimmediately after the injury. Once admitted to the hospital, \\nmortality rates are much lower. Morbidities are numerous and \\ninclude hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, loss of limbs, and \\npsychological dysfunction.\\nPREVENTION\\nSee Chapter 41.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

This hypermetabolic state may continue for up to \\na year after injury.\\nBurns usually are classified based on four criteria:\\n•\\t Depth\\to f \\tin jury\\n•\\t Percent\\to f \\tb ody \\ts urface \\ta rea \\tin volved\\n•\\t Location\\to f \\tt he \\tb urn\\n•\\t Association\\tw ith \\to ther \\tin juries\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nMore than 100,000 children sustain a burn injury each year. \\nFatalities from burns are decreasing, but burns remain a sig-\\nnificant cause of morbidity. Boys are more likely to sustain a \\nburn injury, as are children age 4 and under. Scald burns are \\nmore common in younger children as compared with older \\nchildren. Overall, thermal burns secondary to scald or flame \\nare much more common than electrical or chemical burns. \\nMost fire-related childhood deaths and injuries occur  \\nin homes.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe depth of injury should be assessed by the clinical appearance. \\nCategories of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree are \\ncommonly used; however, classification by depth (superficial, \\nsuperficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-\\nthickness) conveys more information about the structures \\ninjured and the likely need for surgical treatment and may be \\nmore clinically useful.\\nSuperficial (first-degree) burns are red, painful, and dry. They \\nare commonly seen with sun exposure or mild scald injuries, and \\nthese burns involve injury to the epidermis only. They heal in \\n2-5 days without scarring and are not included in burn surface \\narea calculations. Superficial partial-thickness (second-degree) \\nburns involve the entire epidermis and superficial dermis. These \\nburns have fluid-containing blisters. After debridement, the \\nunderlying dermis appears erythematous and wet, is painful, and \\nblanches under pressure. Healing is dependent on the uninjured \\ndermis and usually occurs within 7–21 days without the need \\nfor skin grafting and without scarring. Deep partial-thickness \\n(also second-degree) burns involve the entire epidermis and \\ndeeper portions of the dermis. These burns may also have \\nblistering, but the dermal base is less blanching, mottled pink \\nor white, and less painful than superficial partial-thickness \\nburns. They behave more like full-thickness burns and often \\nrequire excision and grafting. Full-thickness (third-degree \\nand fourth-degree) burns involve all skin layers. They appear \\ndry, white, dark red, brown, or black in color. They do not \\nblanch and are usually insensate. Full-thickness burns require \\nsurgical management. Fourth-degree burns involve underly-\\ning fascia, muscle, or bone and may require reconstruction in \\naddition to grafting. Inhalation injuries should be suspected \\nif there are facial burns, singed nasal hairs, or carbonaceous \\nsputum. Hoarseness on vocalization also is consistent with \\na supraglottic injury. Inhalation injuries may result in bron-\\nchospasm, airway inflammation, and impaired pulmonary  \\nfunction.\\nThere are multiple methods and charts available for calculat-\\ning the percentage of skin surface involved in a burn. One \\nmethod that may be used for children of various ages is presented \\nin Fig. 44.1. The extent of skin involvement of older adolescent \\nand adult patients may be estimated as follows: each upper \\nstabilization of the cervical spine because of the possibility of \\na fall or diving injury. Optimizing oxygenation and maintaining \\ncerebral perfusion are two of the major foci of treatment. \\nRewarming the hypothermic patient requires careful attention \\nto detail, including acid-base and cardiac status. Further treat-\\nment is based on the patient response to initial resuscitation. \\nSome children begin breathing spontaneously and awaken \\nbefore arrival at an emergency department. If the episode was \\nsignificant, these children still require careful observation for \\npulmonary complications over the subsequent 6-12 hours. \\nChildren who have evidence of lung injury, cardiovascular \\ncompromise, or neurological compromise should be monitored \\nin an intensive care unit. Pulmonary dysfunction often results \\nin hypoxemia. Oxygen supplementation should be implemented \\nto maintain normal oxygen saturations. Mechanical ventilation \\nmay be needed in patients with significant pulmonary or \\nneurological dysfunction. Cardiovascular compromise is often \\nthe result of impaired contractility because of hypoxic-ischemic \\ninjury. The use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices and \\nmedical management with hypothermia and sedation is con-\\ntroversial and has not been shown to improve outcomes. \\nProphylactic antibiotics have not been shown to be beneficial \\nand may increase the selection of resistant organisms.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe outcome of drowning is determined by the success of \\nimmediate resuscitation efforts and the severity of the hypoxic-\\nischemic injury to the brain. Patients who have regained \\nconsciousness on arrival at the hospital will likely survive with \\nintact neurological function. Unfavorable prognostic markers \\ninclude the need for continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation \\n(CPR) at the hospital, Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 or less, fixed \\nand dilated pupils, seizures, and coma for more than 72 hours.\\nPREVENTION\\nDespite the decreased incidence of drowning since the 1990s, \\nfew prevention strategies have been shown to be effective. \\nExceptions include implementation of mandatory four-sided \\nfencing around pools (decreasing the number of children <5 \\nyears of age who drown) and immediate provision of CPR to \\nchildren who drown. The use of safety flotation devices in older \\nchildren during water sport activities may be beneficial. \\nEnhanced supervision is required to reduce the incidence of \\ninfants drowning in bathtubs.\\nCHAPTER 44 \\nBurns\\nETIOLOGY\\nThe pathophysiology of burn injury is caused by disruption of \\nthe three key functions of the skin: regulation of heat loss, \\npreservation of body fluids, and barrier to infection. Burn injury \\nreleases inflammatory and vasoactive mediators resulting in \\nincreased capillary permeability, decreased plasma volume, and \\ndecreased cardiac output. The body then becomes hypermeta-\\nbolic with increased resting energy expenditure and protein \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Airway management should include assess-\\nment for the presence of airway or inhalation injury, with early \\nintubation if such an injury is suspected. Smoke inhalation may \\nbe associated with carbon monoxide toxicity; 100% humidified \\noxygen should be given if hypoxia or inhalation is suspected.\\nThe systemic capillary leak that occurs after a serious burn \\nmakes initial fluid and electrolyte support of a burned child \\ncrucial. The first priority is to support the circulating blood \\nvolume, which requires the administration of intravenous fluids \\nto provide maintenance fluid and electrolyte requirements and \\nto replace ongoing burn-related losses. Formulas exist to help \\nguide fluid management; however, no formula accurately \\npredicts the fluid needs of every burn patient. Children with \\na significant burn should receive a rapid bolus of 20 mL/kg o f \\nlactated Ringer solution. Thereafter, the resuscitation formula \\nfor fluid therapy is determined by the percent of body surface \\nburned. Total fluids are 2-4  mL/kg p er percent burn per 24 \\nhours, with half the estimated burn requirement administered \\nduring the first 8 hours. (If resuscitation is delayed, half of \\nthe fluid replacement should be completed by the end of the \\neighth hour post-injury.) Fluids should be titrated to achieve \\nadequate perfusion, and one marker of which is urine output \\ngreater than 1 mL/kg p er hour. Controversy exists over whether \\nand when to administer colloid during fluid resuscitation, but \\ncolloid therapy may be needed for patients with extensive burns.\\nBecause burn injury produces a hypermetabolic response, \\nchildren with significant burns require immediate nutritional \\nsupport. Enteral feeds should be started early unless there is \\na specific contraindication. Children with critical burn injury \\nmay require parenteral nutrition if unable to tolerate full enteral \\nfeeds. Consider supplementation of vitamins and trace elements. \\nOther factors that may improve the hypermetabolic state include \\npain control, blood glucose control, and the use of medications \\nincluding anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone and β blockers \\nsuch as propranolol.\\nWound care starts with cleaning and debriding the wound. \\nEffective pain control is important to allow for complete debride-\\nment. Topical agents and dressings are then applied to control \\nbacterial colonization, decrease evaporative losses, and aid in \\npain control. Various grafts, such as cadaver allografts, porcine \\nxenografts, or skin substitutes, have been used initially to cover \\nwounds. For full-thickness burns, skin autografting and skin \\nsubstitutes are required for eventual closure.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nSee Table 44.1.\\nextremity, 9%; each lower extremity, 18%; anterior trunk, 18%; \\nposterior trunk, 18%; head, 9%; and perineum, 1%.\\nThe location of the burn is important in assessing the risk \\nof disability. The risk is greatest when the face, eyes, ears, feet, \\nperineum, or hands are involved. Inhalation injuries not only \\ncause respiratory compromise but also may result in difficulty \\nin eating and drinking.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nInitial laboratory testing, including complete blood count, type \\nand cross match for blood, coagulation studies, basic chemistry \\nprofile, arterial blood gas, and chest radiograph, can be helpful \\nfor patients with major burns. A carboxyhemoglobin assessment \\nshould be performed for any suspected inhalation exposure (a \\nhouse or closed-space fire or a burn victim who requires car-\\ndiopulmonary resuscitation). Cyanide levels should be considered \\nin children who sustain smoke inhalation and have altered mental \\nstatus. Unusual patterns of burns may increase suspicion of child \\nabuse and result in appropriate evaluation to assess for nonac-\\ncidental trauma to the skeleton or central nervous system.\\nTREATMENT\\nFor severe burns care is best managed by a multidisciplinary \\nteam in a qualified burn center.

In 2014 fatal childhood poisonings were most \\ncommonly caused by analgesics, fumes/gases/vapors, and cough \\nand cold preparations.\\nMore than 2 million human exposures are called into poison \\ncontrol centers in the United States each year. More than half \\nof all exposures are in children (62% in 2014) with a male \\npredominance in children under 13, but a female predominance \\nin adolescence. Most ingestions in young children are uninten-\\ntional, with intentional ingestions becoming more common in \\nchildren 13 and older.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAny child who presents with unexplained symptoms includ -\\ning altered mental status, seizure, cardiovascular compromise, \\nor metabolic abnormality should be considered to have  \\ningested a poison until proven otherwise. A history and \\nphysical examination by someone who understands the signs \\nand symptoms of various ingestions often provide sufficient \\nclues to distinguish between toxic ingestion and organic disease \\n(Table 45.1). Determination of all substances that the child was \\nexposed to, type of medication, amount of medication, and \\ntime of exposure is crucial in directing interventions. Available \\ndata often are incomplete or inaccurate, requiring a careful \\nphysical examination and laboratory approach. A complete \\nphysical examination, including vital signs, is necessary. Certain \\ncomplexes of symptoms and signs are relatively specific to a \\ngiven class of drugs (toxidrome; Table 45.2).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nA poisoned child can exhibit any one of six basic clinical patterns: \\ncoma, toxicity, metabolic acidosis, heart rhythm aberrations, \\ngastrointestinal symptoms, and seizures.\\nComa\\nComa is perhaps the most striking symptom of a poison inges-\\ntion, but it also may be seen as a result of several other causes \\nincluding trauma, a cerebrovascular accident, asphyxia, or \\nmeningitis. A careful history and clinical examination are needed \\nto distinguish among these alternatives.\\nDirect Toxicity\\nHydrocarbon ingestion occasionally may result in systemic \\ntoxicity, but more often it leads to pulmonary toxicity. Hydro-\\ncarbons with low viscosity, low surface tension, and high volatil-\\nity pose the greatest risk of producing aspiration pneumonia; \\nhowever, when swallowed, they pose no risk unless emesis is \\ninduced. Emesis or lavage should not be initiated in a child \\nwho has ingested volatile hydrocarbons.\\nCaustic ingestions may cause dysphagia, epigastric pain, oral \\nmucosal burns, and low-grade fever. Patients with esophageal \\nlesions may have no oral burns or may have significant signs \\nand symptoms. Treatment depends on the agent ingested and \\nthe presence or absence of esophageal injury. Alkali agents may \\nbe solid, granular, or liquid. Liquid agents are tasteless and \\nproduce full-thickness liquefaction necrosis of the esophagus \\nor oropharynx. When the esophageal lesions heal, strictures \\nform. Ingestion of these agents also creates a long-term risk of \\nesophageal carcinoma. Treatment includes antibiotics if there \\nPROGNOSIS\\nMost children who sustain burns recover without significant \\ndisability, but estimation of morbidity is difficult to ascertain \\nfrom databases. Physical scarring and emotional impact of \\ndisfiguring burns are long-term consequences of burn injuries.\\nPREVENTION\\nMost burns occur in the home. Prevention is possible by using \\nsmoke and fire alarms, having identifiable escape routes and \\na fire extinguisher, and reducing hot water temperature to 49°C \\n(120°F). Immersion full-thickness burns develop after 1 second \\nat 70°C (158°F), after 5 seconds at 60°C (140°F), after 30 seconds \\nat 54.5°C (130°F), and after 10 minutes at 49°C (120°F).\\nCHAPTER 45 \\nPoisoning\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe most common agents ingested by young children include \\ncosmetics, personal care products, cleaning solutions, and \\nTABLE 44.1 Complications of Burns\\nPROBLEM TREATMENT\\nSepsis Monitor\\tfor \\tinfection, \\tavoid \\t\\nprophylactic antibiotics\\nHypovolemia Fluid\\treplacement\\nHypothermia Adjust\\tambient \\ttemperature: \\tdry \\t\\nblankets\\tin \\tfield\\nLaryngeal edema Endotracheal intubation, \\ntracheostomy\\nCarbon\\tmonoxide \\tpoisoning 100%\\toxygen, \\thyperbaric \\toxygen\\nCyanide poisoning 100%\\tO2 plus amyl nitrate, sodium \\nnitrate,\\tand \\tsodium \\tthiosulfate\\nCardiac\\tdysfunction Inotropic agents, diuretics\\nGastric\\tulcers H2-receptor\\tantagonist, \\tantacids\\nCompartment syndrome Escharotomy incision\\nContractures Physical therapy\\nHypermetabolic state Enteral and parenteral nutritional \\nsupport, pain control, glucose \\ncontrol, consider β blockers and \\nanabolic steroids\\nRenal\\tfailure Supportive care, dialysis\\nTransient antidiuresis Expectant\\tmanagement\\nAnemia Transfusions\\tas \\tindicated\\nPsychological trauma Psychological rehabilitation\\nPulmonary\\tinfiltrates PEEP,\\tventilation, \\toxygen\\nPulmonary edema Avoid overhydration, give diuretics\\nPneumonia Antibiotics\\nBronchospasm β-Agonist\\taerosols\\nPEEP,\\tPositive \\tend-expiratory \\tpressure.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Acids produce a coagulation \\nnecrosis, which limits the chemical from penetrating into deeper \\nlayers of the mucosa and damages tissue less severely than alkali. \\nThe signs, symptoms, and therapeutic measures are similar to \\nthose for alkali ingestion.\\nMetabolic Acidosis\\nA poisoned child may also have a high anion gap metabolic \\nacidosis (mnemonic MUDPILES; Table 45.3), which is assessed \\neasily by measuring arterial blood gases, serum electrolyte levels, \\nand urine pH. An osmolar gap, if present, strongly suggests \\nthe presence of an unmeasured component, such as methanol \\nor ethylene glycol.

Pain may be expressed by verbal or visible discomfort, \\ncrying, agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. \\nA variety of scales have been developed in an attempt to \\nquantify pain and allow more directed therapy. Few of these \\nscales are well validated, especially in populations of acutely \\nill children with physiological derangements secondary to the \\nunderlying pathology.

Specific \\nattention must be paid to assessment of the airway (for ability \\nto maintain a patent airway) and respiratory system (asthma, \\nrecent respiratory illness, loose teeth), cardiovascular status \\n(especially adequacy of volume status), factors affecting drug \\nmetabolism (renal or liver disease), and risk of aspiration \\n(adequate nothing-by-mouth status, gastroesophageal reflux). \\nDuring the administration of procedural sedation, assessment \\nof status must include monitoring of oxygen saturation, heart \\nrate, and respiratory rate, as well as some assessment of effective-\\nness of ventilation. This assessment must be performed by \\nsomeone who is not involved in the procedure; this person is \\nalso responsible for recording vital signs and drugs administered \\non a time-based graph. Monitoring must be continued until \\nthe child has returned to baseline. Patients who are receiving \\nlong-term sedation (e.g., to maintain endotracheal tube place-\\nment) may need only local anesthesia for painful procedures \\nbut may benefit from additional sedation or analgesia as well.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nMost poisonings result in minimal or no toxicity, or have minor \\neffects. Intentional ingestions result in a much higher rate (5.2%) \\nof major effects or death compared with unintentional ingestions \\n(0.2%).

Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. \\n20th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016.\\nNonprocedural Sedation\\nMany ventilated pediatric patients require sedation and some \\nanalgesia while intubated. Dexmedetomidine, a centrally-acting \\nselective α(2)-receptor agonist, is becoming increasingly popular \\ndue to its ability to provide sedation without respiratory depres-\\nsion. Longer acting benzodiazepine and opioids are also \\ncommonly used. Avoidance of oversedation is important. Use \\nof appropriate pain and sedation scores allows for titration of \\nmedications to achieve goals of the sedation plan. Long-term \\nuse of benzodiazepines and opioids leads to tolerance, a \\nproblematic occurrence that must be considered as medications \\nare added and weaned. Medications used for sedation and \\nanalgesia may also contribute to delirium, a phenomenon that \\nis being increasingly recognized in critically ill patients.\\nPAIN AND ANALGESIA\\nThe subjective aspect of pain requires that self-reporting be \\nused for assessment. Visual analog scales, developed for adult \\npatients (allowing patients to rate pain on a scale of 1 to 10), \\nhave been used for older children. Pain scales for younger \\nchildren often incorporate behavioral and physiological param-\\neters, despite the imprecision of physiological responses.\\nLocal anesthetics, such as lidocaine, can be used for minor \\nprocedures. However, lidocaine requires subcutaneous or \\nintradermal injection. The use of EMLA, a cream containing \\nlidocaine and prilocaine, is less effective than intradermal \\nlidocaine but is preferred by many patients.\\nTABLE 46.1 Agents that Produce Sedation\\nSEDATIVES EFFECT CONCERNS\\nMidazolam Anxiolysis,\\tsedation, \\tmuscle \\trelaxation, \\tamnesia Tolerance\\tis \\tpossible; \\tapnea, \\thypotension, \\tdepressed \\tmyocardial \\t\\nfunction;\\tshort \\taction\\nLorazepam Anxiolysis,\\tsedation, \\tmuscle \\trelaxation, \\tamnesia Same\\tas \\tmidazolam; \\tlonger \\taction\\nDexmedetomidine Sedation without respiratory depression May cause bradycardia\\nKetamine Anesthesia, analgesia, amnesia Dissociative reactions, tachycardia, hypertension, increased \\nbronchial\\tsecretions, \\temergent \\tdelirium, \\thallucinations; \\tincreases \\t\\nintracranial pressure\\nChloral hydrate Sedative Emesis,\\thypotension, \\tarrhythmias, \\thepatic \\tdysfunction\\nPropofol Rapid-onset\\tsedative \\tfor \\tinduction \\tand \\t\\nmaintenance\\tof \\tanesthesia\\nMetabolic\\tacidosis \\tin \\tchildren; \\tmay \\tdepress \\tcardiac \\tfunction\\nTABLE 46.2 Agents that Produce Analgesia\\nANALGESIC EFFECT COMPLICATIONS\\nAcetaminophen and \\nNSAIDs\\nModerate analgesia, antipyresis Ceiling\\teffect\\nNSAIDs—gastrointestinal bleed, ulceration\\nOpioids No\\tceiling \\teffect; \\trespiratory \\tdepression, \\tsedation, \\tpruritus, \\tnausea/vomiting, \\t\\ndecreased gastric motility, urinary retention, tolerance with abuse potential\\nMorphine Analgesia May cause myocardial depression\\nCodeine Analgesia Nausea/vomiting\\nFentanyl,\\talfentanil, \\t\\nsufentanil\\nAnalgesia, sedation No\\tadverse \\teffects \\ton \\tcardiovascular \\tsystem; \\tstiff \\tchest \\tsyndrome\\nMethadone Analgesia\\nNSAIDs,\\tNonsteroidal \\tantiinflammatory \\tdrugs.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Marion | Paul A. Levy\\nCHAPTER 47 \\nPatterns of Inheritance\\nTYPES OF GENETIC DISORDERS\\nAmong infants born in the United States, 2-4% have congenital \\nmalformations, abnormalities of form or function identifiable \\nat birth. At 1 year of age, the number approaches 7%, because \\nsome anomalies may not be identifiable until after the neonatal \\nperiod. The prevalence of congenital malformations is much \\ngreater in inpatient pediatric populations; 30-50% of hospitalized \\nchildren have congenital anomalies or genetic disorders.\\nThe clinical geneticist attempts to identify the etiology, mode \\nof inheritance, and risk that a disorder might occur in the \\naffected child’s siblings. In evaluating children with congenital \\nmalformations, the condition’s etiology may be classified into \\none of five different categories:\\n1. Single-gene mutations, occurring in 6% of children with \\ncongenital anomalies\\n2. Chromosomal disorders, accounting for approximately 7.5%\\n3. Multifactorially inherited conditions, accounting for 20%\\n4. Disorders that show an unusual pattern of inheritance, \\naccounting for 2-3%\\n5. Conditions caused by exposure to teratogens, accounting \\nfor 6%\\nIn most cases, the etiology cannot be classified into one \\nof these categories. In these individuals, the etiology remains \\nunknown.\\nINTRODUCTION TO GENETICS  \\nAND GENOMICS\\nDNA is composed of four nucleotide building blocks: adenine, \\nguanine, cytosine, and thymine. Each nucleotide is linked to \\nother nucleotides, forming a chain. The DNA molecule consists \\nof two chains of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds. \\nThe purine nucleotides, adenine and guanine, cross link by \\nhydrogen bonds to the pyrimidines, thymine and cytosine. \\nBecause of this cross linking, the nucleotide sequence of one \\nstrand sets the other strand’s sequence. Separating the two \\nstrands permits complementary nucleotides to bind to each \\nDNA strand; this copies the DNA and replicates the sequence.\\nDNA exists as multiple fragments that, together with a protein \\nskeleton (chromatin), form chromosomes. Human cells have \\n23 pairs of chromosomes, with one copy of each chromosome \\ninherited from each parent. Twenty-two pairs of chromosomes \\nare autosomes; the remaining pair consists of sex chromosomes. \\nFemales have two X chromosomes; males have one X and one Y .\\nSpread along the chromosomes like beads on a string, \\nDNA sequences form genes, the basic units of heredity. A \\ntypical gene contains a promoter sequence, an untranslated \\nregion, and an open reading frame. In the open reading frame, \\nevery three nucleotides represent a single codon, coding for \\na particular amino acid. In this way, the sequence of bases \\ndictates the sequence of amino acids in the corresponding \\nprotein. Some codons, rather than coding for specific amino \\nacids, act as “start” signals, whereas others serve as “stop” \\nsignals. Between the start and stop codons, genes consist of \\ntwo major portions: exons, regions containing the code that \\nultimately corresponds to a sequence of amino acids, and introns \\n(intervening sequence), which do not become part of the amino  \\nacid sequence.\\nGenes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) then \\ntranslated into proteins. During transcription, RNA is processed \\nto remove introns. The mRNA serves as a template to construct \\nthe protein.\\nHuman genetic material contains 3 billion bases. Less than \\n2% of the DNA codes for proteins, comprising the genome’s \\n19,000-20,000 genes. Through a mechanism called alternative \\nsplicing, these genes may create more than 100,000 proteins. \\nThe remainder of the DNA, the portion not involved in protein \\nformation, was once termed junk DNA, but a project called \\nENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) found that much \\nof this presumed junk DNA is functional and likely serves \\nregulatory functions.\\nDisease may be caused by changes or mutations in the DNA \\nsequence, with the point mutation, a change in a single DNA \\nbase, being the most common type. A point mutation that \\nchanges a codon and the resulting amino acid that goes into \\nthe protein is referred to as a missense mutation. A nonsense \\nmutation is a point mutation that changes the codon to a “stop” \\nsignal so that transcription ends prematurely. A frameshift  \\nmutation often stems from the loss or addition of one or more \\nbases; this causes a shift in how the DNA is transcribed and \\ngenerally leads to premature stop codons.\\nPedigree Drawing\\nTo identify specific patterns of inheritance, geneticists construct \\nand analyze pedigrees, pictorial representations of a family \\nhistory. Males are represented by squares and females by circles. \\nMatings are connected with a solid line between each partner’s \\nsymbols. Children from a couple are represented below their \\nparents and are the next generation.\\nGrandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins are added in similar \\nfashion.

Caused by a mutation in FBN1, clinical \\nsymptoms mainly involve three systems: cardiac, ophthalmo-\\nlogical, and skeletal. Skeletal findings include dolichostenomelia \\n(a tall, thin body habitus, spider-like fingers and toes (arach -\\nnodactyly), abnormalities of the sternum (pectus excavatum \\nor carinatum), scoliosis, pes planus, and joint laxity. Eye findings \\ninclude high myopia, which can lead to vitreoretinal degenera-\\ntion; an abnormal suspensory ligament of the lens, which can \\nlead to ectopia lentis (dislocation of the lens); and cataracts. \\nCardiac findings include progressive dilatation of the aortic \\nroot, and aortic insufficiency followed by aortic dissection is \\na common complication. Other clinical features include dural \\nectasia, abnormal pulmonary septation, and striae. Diagnostic \\ncriteria for MFS are summarized in Table 47.3.\\nNew mutations in FBN1 account for 25% of cases of MFS. The \\ngene is large and complex, and more than 1,300 mutations have \\nbeen identified in affected individuals. Many of the symptoms \\nof MFS are caused not by the defect in the fibrillin protein itself \\nbut rather by an excess in transforming growth factor-beta \\n(TGF-β), a protein usually bound by fibrillin.\\nAutosomal Recessive Disorders\\nDisorders that are inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) \\nmanner manifest only when both copies of a gene pair located \\non a non-sex chromosome have a mutation (Tables 47.4 and \\n47.5). Children affected with AR disorders are usually born to \\nunaffected parents, each of whom carries one copy of the \\nmutation. If both members of a couple are carriers (or hetero-\\nzygotes) for this mutation, each of their offspring has a 25% \\nchance of being affected (Fig. 47.3).\\nSickle Cell Disease\\nSee Chapter 150.\\nTay-Sachs Disease\\nSee Chapters 56 and 185.\\nX-Linked Disorders\\nApproximately 2,000 genes have been identified on the X \\nchromosome, whereas only 200 are believed to be present on \\nthe Y chromosome. Females, whose cells have two copies of \\nan X chromosome, possess two copies of each of these genes, \\nwhereas males, who have one X chromosome and one Y \\nchromosome, have only one copy. Early in female development, \\none X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell. There \\nare many X-linked disorders (colorblindness, Duchenne \\nmuscular dystrophy, hemophilia A) in which heterozygous \\n(carrier) females show some manifestations of the disorder \\ndue to skewed X chromosome inactivation.\\nOften, AD disorders show variability in symptoms expressed \\nin different individuals carrying the same mutated gene. Some \\nindividuals have only mild clinical symptoms, whereas others \\nhave more severe disease. This phenomenon is referred to as \\nvariable expressivity.\\nAD disorders sometimes appear in a child of unaffected \\nparents because of a spontaneous mutation. Known in some \\ncases to be associated with advanced paternal age (>35 years of \\nage), spontaneous mutations may account for most individuals \\nwith some disorders. For instance, 80% of children born with \\nachondroplasia (ACH) have a spontaneous mutation in the \\nfibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) gene. The \\nfollowing are examples of AD disorders.\\nAchondroplasia\\nCaused by a defect in cartilage-derived bone, ACH is the most \\ncommon skeletal dysplasia in humans. The bony abnormalities \\nlead to short stature, macrocephaly, a flat midface with a \\nprominent forehead, and rhizomelic (“root of the limb”) shorten-\\ning of the limbs. The disorder occurs in approximately 1 in \\n25,000 births.\\nACH is caused by a mutation in FGFR3. Early in devel -\\nopment, this gene is expressed during endochondral bone \\nformation. More than 95% of cases of ACH are caused by \\none of two mutations in the same base pair (site 1138). This \\nsite, extremely active for mutations, is known as a mutational  \\nhot spot.\\nAs they grow, children with ACH often develop associated \\nmedical and psychological problems. Hydrocephalus and \\ncentral apnea may occur because of narrowing of the foramen \\nmagnum and compression of the brainstem and may present \\na life-threatening complication in infancy. Bowing of the legs \\nmay occur later in childhood because of unequal growth of \\nthe tibia and fibula. Dental malocclusion, obstructive apnea, \\nand hearing loss due to middle ear dysfunction are common \\nin later childhood. During later childhood and adolescence, \\nthe psychological effects of the short stature may manifest. In \\nadulthood, further complications include compression of nerve \\nroots and sciatica. People with ACH have normal life spans \\nand normal intelligence.\\nThe diagnosis of ACH is made on the basis of clinical findings, \\nand characteristic x-ray abnormalities confirm the diagnosis. \\nMolecular testing is available, and prenatal diagnosis is possible \\nusing fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or chorionic \\nvillus sampling.\\nNeurofibromatosis Type 1\\nOne of the most common AD disorders, neurofibromatosis \\ntype 1 (NF1) is present in 1 in 3,500 individuals.

Normal in early childhood, individuals \\naffected with MELAS develop episodic vomiting, seizures, and \\nrecurrent cerebral insults that resemble strokes between 5 and \\n10 years of age. In 80% of cases, analysis of the mtDNA reveals \\na specific mutation (A3242G) in MTTL1, a gene that codes for \\na mitochondrial transfer RNA.\\nIn families in which MELAS occurs, a range of symptoms \\nis seen in first-degree relatives, including progressive external \\nophthalmoplegia, hearing loss, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes \\nmellitus. Although all offspring of a woman who carries a muta-\\ntion would be affected, because of heteroplasmy the severity of \\ndisease varies depending on the percentage of mitochondria \\nbearing the mutation that are present.\\nUniparental Disomy\\nEvaluation of a child with uniparental disomy (UPD) reveals \\na normal karyotype. However, chromosomal markers for one \\nparticular chromosome are identical to the markers found on \\nthe chromosomes of the patient’s mother or father (but not \\nboth as is normal). In UPD, the individual inherits two copies \\nof one parent’s chromosome and no copy from the other parent.\\nUPD probably occurs through a few mechanisms, but the \\nmost common results from a spontaneous rescue mechanism. At \\nthe time of conception, through nondisjunction, the fertilized \\negg is trisomic for a particular chromosome, with two copies \\nof one parent’s chromosome and one copy of the other parent’s \\nchromosome; conceptuses with trisomy often miscarry early in \\ndevelopment. Fetuses with UPD survive because they spontane-\\nously lose one of three copies of the affected chromosome. If \\nthe single chromosome from one parent is lost, the patient \\nhas UPD.\\nAn alternate explanation involves monosomy for a chromo-\\nsome rather than trisomy. Had the conceptus, at the time of \\nconception, inherited only a single copy of a chromosome, \\nspontaneous duplication of the single chromosome would lead \\nto UPD.\\nPrader-Willi and Angelman Syndromes\\ncurve is determined by many factors, including the expression of \\nmultiple, unknown genes. HPS may result when an individual’s \\ngenetic and environmental influences cause him or her to fall to \\nan extreme position on this curve, past a certain point called a \\nthreshold. In HPS this threshold is farther to the left for males \\nthan it is for females.\\nNeural Tube Defects, Including Myelomeningocele\\nBefore 1998 myelomeningocele affected 1 in 1,000 liveborn \\ninfants in the United States. Anencephaly occurred with a similar \\nfrequency, although most anencephalic infants were either \\nstillborn or died in the neonatal period. Since 1998, because \\nof the supplementation of food staples with folic acid, the \\nincidence of both conditions has decreased by 70%. Multiple \\ngenetic and nongenetic factors dictate the speed with which \\nthe neural tube closes, as follows:\\n1. Th e frequency of neural tube defects (NTDs) varies greatly \\nin different ethnic groups. They are more common in the \\nBritish Isles, where, in 1990, they occurred in 1 in 250 live \\nbirths, and are far less common in Asia, where the frequency \\nwas 1 in 4,000. These ethnic differences suggest a genetic \\ncomponent.\\n2. C ouples from the British Isles who move to the United States \\nhave a risk intermediate between the risks in the United \\nKingdom and the United States, suggesting an environmental \\ncomponent.\\n3. Th e occurrence of NTDs exhibits seasonality.

These repeats occur in the promoter region \\nof the gene FMR1. Unaffected individuals who have no family \\nhistory of FRAX have 0-45 CGG repeats (most have 25-35). In \\nindividuals with FRAX, the number of repeats is greater than \\n200; such people are said to have a full mutation. Between \\nthese two categories, a third group has 56-200 repeats; these \\nindividuals, known as premutation carriers, have typical \\ndevelopment.\\nFRAX results from a failure to express FMRP , the protein \\nproduct of the FMR1 gene, which is expressed primarily in \\nthe central nervous system and testes during early embryonic \\ndevelopment. Although FMRP is produced in unaffected \\nindividuals and premutation carriers, in those with the full \\nmutation, FMRP transcription of the protein is blocked \\nbecause the large number of CGG repeats become methyl-\\nated (an epigenetic phenomenon). Thus FRAX occurs as a \\nconsequence of a loss-of-function mutation—the failure of \\nexpression of FMRP because of methylation of the promoter  \\nsequence.\\nIn female premutation carriers, an expansion in the number \\nof repeats from the premutation to the full mutation range may \\noccur during gametogenesis. The cause of this expansion is \\nnot understood. Although premutation carriers do not show \\nsymptoms and signs of FRAX, women may manifest primary \\novarian insufficiency and early menopause, and men and women \\nmay develop a movement disorder, known as fragile X tremor/\\nataxia syndrome later in life.\\nTERATOGENIC AGENTS\\nApproximately 6.5% of all birth defects are attributed to \\nteratogens—chemical, physical, or biological agents that have \\nthe potential to damage embryonic tissue and result in congenital \\nmalformations. Agents known to be teratogenic include drugs \\n(prescription and nonprescription); intrauterine infections \\n(rubella); maternal diseases, such as diabetes mellitus; and \\nenvironmental substances, such as alcohol and heavy metals. \\nKnowledge of teratogenic agents and their effect on the develop-\\ning fetus is important because limiting exposure to these agents \\nis an effective way to prevent birth defects (see Chapter 59).\\nMaternal Infections\\nRubella was the first maternal infection known to cause a pattern \\nof malformations in fetuses affected in utero. Cytomegalovirus, \\nToxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex, Zika virus, and varicella \\nare additional potentially teratogenic in utero infections (see \\nChapter 66).\\nMaternal Disease\\nMaternal diabetes mellitus and maternal phenylketonuria can \\nresult in congenital anomalies in the fetus. Strict control of \\nthese disorders before and during pregnancy protects the \\ndeveloping child (see Chapter 59).\\nMedications and Chemicals\\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorder , which occurs in 10-20 per \\n1,000 children, may be the most common teratogenic syndrome. \\ndevelop a voracious appetite with resulting obesity. Between \\n60% and 70% of individuals with PWS have a small deletion \\nof chromosome 15 (15q11). In individuals without a deletion, \\n20% have UPD of chromosome 15.\\nAngelman syndrome (AS) is a condition with moderate to \\nsevere intellectual disability, absence of speech, ataxic movements \\nof the arms and legs, a characteristic craniofacial appearance, \\nand a seizure disorder that is characterized by inappropriate \\nlaughter. AS is also characterized by a deletion in the 15q11 \\nregion in 70% of affected individuals; UPD for chromosome \\n15 can be demonstrated in approximately 10% of AS patients.\\nIf the deletion occurs in paternal chromosome 15, the affected \\nindividual will develop PWS, whereas AS results from a deletion \\noccurring only in the maternal chromosome 15. When UPD is \\nresponsible, maternal UPD results in PWS, whereas paternal \\nUPD results in AS. To summarize, if a copy of paternal chromo-\\nsome 15q11.2 is lacking, PWS occurs; if maternal chromosome \\n15q11.2 is lacking, AS results.\\nThis phenomenon is explained by genomic imprinting . \\nImprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon, a nonheritable change \\nin the DNA that causes an alteration in gene expression based \\non parental origin of the gene. PWS is caused by deficiency \\nof the protein product of the gene SNRPN (small nuclear \\nribonucleoprotein). Although present on both maternally and \\npaternally derived chromosome 15, SNRPN is expressed only in \\nthe paternally derived chromosome. Expression is blocked in the \\nmaternal chromosome because the bases of the open reading \\nframe are methylated; this physical change in the DNA prevents \\ngene expression. PWS results whenever a paternal chromosome \\n15 is missing, either through deletion or through UPD.\\nAS results from a lack of expression of ubiquitin-protein \\nligase E3A (UBE3A), a second gene in the chromosome 15q11.2 \\nregion. UBE3A is normally expressed only in the maternally \\nderived chromosome 15. Although present in paternal chromo-\\nsome 15, UBE3A is methylated, and gene expression is blocked. \\nTherefore if either the critical region of maternal chromosome 15 \\nis deleted, or paternal UPD occurs, the individual will manifest \\nsymptoms of AS.\\nExpansion of a Trinucleotide Repeat\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAtaxia\\nMore than 50% of human DNA appears as repeat sequences, \\ntwo or three bases repeated over and over again. Disorders \\ncaused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats include fragile X \\nsyndrome (FRAX), Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, \\nFriedreich ataxia, and the spinocerebellar ataxias. Although \\nan increase in the number of the three repeated bases is at the \\nheart of each disorder, the molecular mechanism differs.\\nFRAX, which occurs with a frequency of approximately \\n1 in 2,000 children, is the most common cause of inherited \\nintellectual disability.

People of African ancestry \\nmay choose to be screened for sickle cell disease. People whose \\nancestors originated in the Mediterranean basin may be screened \\nfor thalassemia.\\nHistorically, prenatal screening has involved invasive and \\nnoninvasive testing. Invasive testing includes amniocentesis and \\nchorionic villus sampling (CVS). Noninvasive testing includes \\nsonography, which is utilized routinely throughout pregnancies, \\nand the use of a series of biochemical markers present in the \\nmother’s blood. The first such marker identified was elevated \\nmaternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MS AFP) and is now used \\nto identify pregnancies in which the fetus was affected with \\nneural tube defects, omphalocele, or gastroschisis. An additional \\nassociation between low levels of MS AFP and fetal aneuploidy is \\nknown. Approximately 50% of fetuses with autosomal trisomies \\n(Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13) can be detected by \\nlow levels of MS AFP .\\nAdditional proteins—unconjugated estriol (uE3), inhibin \\nA, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), each of which \\nhas been shown to be associated with varying risks of fetal \\naneuploidy—have been added to MS AFP to create a biochemi-\\ncal profile known as the quad screen. The addition of these \\ncompounds increased the detection rate to about 80%.\\nThe quad screen is performed in the second trimester. \\nDuring the first trimester, measurement of the fetal nuchal \\nfold by sonogram can be used to identify risk for aneuploidy; \\nincrease in the nuchal thickness is a marker not only for fetal \\nchromosomal anomalies, but for certain genetic and structural \\nabnormalities as well. Once standardized, the detection rate \\nfor aneuploidy approached using this technique rose to 70%. \\nThe addition of testing for abnormalities in free β-HCG and \\nPAPP-A (pregnancy associated plasma protein) has enhanced \\nfirst trimester screening to a detection rate of almost 90%.\\nAlthough the risk of nondisjunction resulting in aneu -\\nploidy rises with maternal age, all pregnant women should \\nbe individually counseled as to their risk for aneuploidy and \\nother fetal abnormalities. A combination of first and second \\ntrimester screening together with the women’s age produces \\nan individualized risk factor. It is important to emphasize \\nthat both first and second trimester screening tests are just \\nthat―screening tests used to identify individuals who are at \\nincreased risk. If the risk is high or if concerns exist about the \\npresence of a fetal anomaly, a more definitive test, either CVS \\nor amniocentesis, has been offered as further testing. Fetal cells \\nare usually tested for chromosomal abnormalities by cytogenetic \\ntechniques, but the use of chromosomal microarray is becoming \\nmore common. Biochemical testing for a known family history \\nof an inherited metabolic disorder and molecular screening for \\nknown familial mutations can also be performed on fetal cells.\\nPrenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal \\nblood offers the ability to detect trisomies in fetuses using \\na maternal blood sample without an invasive test (amnio-\\ncentesis, CVS). Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) use has \\nbeen increasing in popularity. Because of its low risk and high \\naccuracy, it is expected that NIPT will eventually replace all \\nother forms of prenatal genetic testing.\\nMaternal Factors\\nThe presence of either acute or chronic maternal illness during \\npregnancy may lead to complications in the developing fetus. \\nFeatures include prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, \\ndevelopmental disabilities, microcephaly, skeletal and cardiac \\nanomalies, and a characteristic facial appearance. To cause the \\nfull-blown fetal alcohol syndrome, pregnant women must drink \\nalcohol throughout the pregnancy. Lesser consumption during \\nall or part of the gestation will lead to milder symptoms.\\nWarfarin, retinoic acid, and phenytoin are additional \\nteratogenic agents (see Chapter 59).\\nRadiation\\nHigh-dose radiation exposure during pregnancy in Hiroshima \\nand Nagasaki, Japan, was shown to increase the rate of spontane-\\nous abortion and result in children born with microcephaly, \\nmental retardation, and skeletal malformations. Estimates of \\nexposure to cause these effects were approximately 25 rad. The \\ndose from routine radiological diagnostic examinations is in the \\nmillirad range.\\nCHAPTER 48 \\nGenetic Assessment\\nIndividuals referred to a geneticist because of suspicion of a \\ngenetic disorder are called probands; individuals who come \\nfor genetic counseling are consultands. Referral for genetic \\nevaluation may be made for a wide variety of reasons and at \\ndifferent stages of life (fetus, neonate, childhood, pregnancy, \\nadulthood).\\nPRECONCEPTION AND PRENATAL \\nCOUNSELING\\nFamilial Factors\\nFamilies with relatives affected with genetic disorders may have \\nquestions about how a disorder is inherited and whether their \\nprogeny may be at risk. The inheritance pattern and the risk \\nof having an affected child can be discussed with a \\ngeneticist.\\nIn some cultures, it is common, even desirable, for relatives to \\nmarry. This relatedness or consanguinity increases the likelihood \\nthat offspring may be born with a rare autosomal recessive \\n(AR) condition, as both parents may be carriers of the same \\nmutated gene. Generally, the closer the relation between the \\npartners, the greater the chance that the couple shares one \\nor more mutated genes in common, increasing the risk that \\noffspring will have an AR disorder. The risk of first cousins \\nhaving a child with an AR disorder is 1 in 64. In evaluating \\nthese couples, it is important to determine which ethnic group \\nthey belong to and to test for conditions commonly found in \\nthat group (see later).\\nScreening\\nIt is common for couples to be screened for disorders that may \\noccur more commonly in their particular ethnic group.

With X-linked disorders, the focus is on the maternal \\nfamily history to determine if there is a significant enough risk \\nto warrant testing.\\nQuestions about the couple’s age are important to ascertain \\nthe risk related to maternal age for chromosome abnormali-\\nties and paternal age for new mutations leading to AD and \\nX-linked disorders. A history of more than two spontaneous \\nabortions increases the risk that one of the parents carries a \\nbalanced translocation and the spontaneous abortions are due \\nto chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.\\nPregnancy\\nDuring a genetic consultation, it is important to gather informa-\\ntion about the pregnancy (see Chapters 58, 59, and 60). A \\nmaternal history of a chronic medical condition, such as a \\nseizure disorder or diabetes, has known consequences in the \\nfetus. Medication used in pregnancy can be teratogenic; the \\npregnant woman’s exposure to toxic chemicals (work related) \\nor use of alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs of abuse can have serious \\neffects on the developing fetus. Maternal infection during \\npregnancy with TORCH agents (see earlier), among others, \\nhas been found to cause malformations in the fetus.\\nInformation about the pregnancy may provide clues as to \\nthe health of the fetus. For more information about this, please \\nsee Chapter 50.\\nFollow-up is needed if prenatal testing revealed abnormal \\nresults.\\nDelivery and Birth\\nAn infant born prematurely is likely to have more complications \\nthan a term infant. An infant can be small, appropriate, or \\nlarge for his or her gestational age; each of these has implications \\nfor the child (see Chapters 58 and 60).\\nMedical History\\nChildren with inborn errors of metabolism who have intermit-\\ntent symptoms often have a history of multiple hospitalizations \\nfor dehydration or vomiting. Children with neuromuscular \\ndisorders may have a normal period followed by increasing \\nweakness or ataxia. Children with lysosomal storage diseases, \\nsuch as the mucopolysaccharidoses, often have recurrent ear \\ninfections and can develop sleep apnea.\\nDevelopment\\nMany genetic disorders are associated with developmental \\ndisabilities. However, the onset of the disability may not always \\nbe present from the newborn period; many inborn errors of \\nmetabolism, including storage disorders, cause developmental \\nmanifestations after a period of normal development (see \\nChapters 7 and 8). Some adult-onset disorders have no symptoms \\nuntil the teens or later. Assessing school problems is important. \\nThe type of learning problem, age at onset, and whether there \\nis improvement with intervention or continued decline all are \\nimportant for proper assessment.\\nChronic conditions may expose the fetus to maternal medica-\\ntions that are potentially teratogenic. Acute illnesses, especially \\nfrom the TORCH agents (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cyto-\\nmegalovirus, herpes virus, and “other, ” including syphilis, \\nvaricella, and Zika virus), expose the fetus to infectious agents \\nthat may cause birth defects. Other factors, such as maternal \\nsmoking, alcohol use, and maternal exposure to radiation or \\nchemicals, also may necessitate genetic counseling.\\nPostnatal—Newborn and Infant\\nBetween 2% and 4% of newborns have a genetic abnormal -\\nity or congenital malformation (see Chapter 47). The broad \\ndefinition of malformations includes not only visible abnor-\\nmalities but also functional defects that might not be apparent  \\nat birth.\\nCongenital malformations and genetic disorders have a \\nsignificant impact on childhood morbidity and mortality. Almost \\n11% of childhood deaths can be traced to a genetic cause. If \\ncontributing genetic factors related to childhood deaths are \\nconsidered, this increases to nearly 25%. Consultation with a \\ngeneticist for a newborn or infant may be prompted by many \\ndifferent findings, including the presence of a malformation, \\nabnormal results on a routine newborn screening test, abnor-\\nmalities in growth (e.g., failure to gain weight, increase in length, \\nor abnormal head growth), developmental delay, blindness or \\ndeafness, and the knowledge of a family history of a genetic \\ndisorder or chromosomal abnormality or (as a result of prenatal \\ntesting) the presence of a genetic disorder or chromosomal \\nabnormality in the infant.\\nAdolescent and Adult\\nAdolescents and adults may be seen by a geneticist for evaluation \\nof a genetic disorder that has late onset. Some neurodegenerative \\ndisorders, such as Huntington disease and adult-onset spinal \\nmuscular atrophy, present later in life. Some forms of hereditary \\nblindness (retinal degenerative diseases) and deafness (Usher \\nsyndrome, neurofibromatosis type 2) may not show significant \\nsymptoms until adolescence or early adulthood. Similarly, \\ninherited cardiac disorders such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \\nand long QT syndrome may not be identifiable until adulthood. \\nGenetic consultation also may be prompted for a known family \\nhistory of a hereditary cancer syndrome (breast, thyroid, colon, \\nand ovarian cancers). Individuals may wish to have testing \\ndone to determine if they carry a mutation for these syndromes \\nand would be at risk for developing certain types of cancers. \\nA known family history or personal history of a genetic disorder \\nor chromosomal abnormality might prompt testing in anticipa-\\ntion of pregnancy planning.\\nGENERAL APPROACH TO PATIENTS\\nFamily History\\nA pedigree usually is drawn to help visualize various inheritance \\npatterns.

When a child is \\naffected with the new onset of an AD disorder, it is necessary \\nto closely examine the parents to check for the presence of \\nmanifestations.

Using polymerase chain reaction and other techniques \\ndeveloped during the Human Genome Project, WES isolates \\nDNA from an individual, looks for variations in the exomes \\nor coding sequences of the genes, and compares identified \\nvariation with the DNA from the individual’s parents. Variation \\nfound in the subject that is not present in either parent suggests \\na spontaneous mutation; two copies of a mutation in an \\nindividual whose parents are each found to be carriers of the \\nmutation suggests that the subject is affected with an autosomal \\nrecessively inherited disorder.\\nThough there exist several shortcomings in WES (it is \\nexpensive, the interpretation is complicated as thousands of \\nvariations are often identified, the vast majority of which are \\nbenign), its benefit as a diagnostic tool is incredible. WES and \\nthe related whole genome sequencing will revolutionize the \\nway clinical genetics, and in fact all of pediatrics, is practiced.\\nCHAPTER 49 \\nChromosomal Disorders\\nErrors that occur in meiosis during the production of gametes \\ncan lead to abnormalities of chromosome structure or number. \\nSyndromes caused by chromosomal abnormalities include \\ntrisomy 21 (Down syndrome [DS]), trisomy 13, trisomy 18, \\nTurner syndrome (TS), and Klinefelter syndrome (KS), as well \\nas rarer chromosomal duplications, deletions, or inversions.\\nChromosomal abnormalities occur in approximately 8% of \\nfertilized ova but in only 0.6% of liveborn infants. Fifty percent \\nof spontaneous abortuses have a chromosomal abnormality, \\nthe most common being 45,X (TS); an estimated 99% of 45,X \\nfetuses are spontaneously aborted. The fetal loss rate for DS, \\nthe most viable of the autosomal aneuploidies, approaches \\n80%. Most other chromosomal abnormalities also adversely \\naffect fetal viability. In newborns and older children, features \\nthat suggest the presence of a chromosome anomaly include \\nlow birth weight (small for gestational age), failure to thrive, \\ndevelopmental disability, and the presence of three or more \\ncongenital malformations.\\nABNORMALITIES IN NUMBER (ANEUPLOIDY)\\nDuring meiosis or mitosis, failure of a chromosomal pair to \\nseparate properly results in nondisjunction. Aneuploidy is a \\nchange in the number of chromosomes that results from \\nnondisjunction. A cell may have one (monosomy) or three \\n(trisomy) copies of a particular chromosome.\\nPhysical Examination\\nA careful and thorough physical examination is necessary for \\nall patients with signs, symptoms, or suspicion of genetic disease. \\nSometimes subtle clues may lead to an unsuspected diagnosis. \\nFeatures suggestive of a syndrome are discussed in more detail \\nin Chapter 50.\\nLaboratory Evaluation\\nChromosome Analysis\\nAn individual’s chromosome complement, known as the \\nkaryotype, can be analyzed using cells capable of dividing. In \\npediatrics, lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood are \\nthe usual source for such cells, but cells obtained from bone \\nmarrow aspiration, skin biopsy (fibroblasts), or, prenatally, from \\namniotic fluid or chorionic villi also can be used. Cells are \\nplaced in culture medium and stimulated to grow using a \\nmitogen; their division is arrested in either metaphase or \\nprophase using a spindle poison; slides are made, the chromo-\\nsomes are stained with Giemsa or other dyes, and the chro -\\nmosomes are examined and analyzed under a microscope.\\nIn metaphase, chromosomes are short, squat, and easy to \\ncount. Metaphase analysis should be ordered in children whose \\nfeatures suggest a known aneuploidy syndrome, such as a trisomy \\nor monosomy. Chromosomes analyzed in prophase are long, \\nthin, and drawn out; analysis gives far more details than are \\nseen in metaphase preparations. Prophase analysis is ordered \\nin individuals with multiple congenital anomalies without an \\nobvious disorder.\\nFluorescent In Situ Hybridization\\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) allows the identification \\nof the presence or absence of a specific region of DNA. A \\ncomplementary DNA probe specific for the region in question \\nis generated, and a fluorescent marker is attached. The probe \\nis incubated with cells from the subject and viewed under a \\nmicroscope. The bound probe fluoresces, allowing the number \\nof copies of the DNA segment in question to be counted. This \\ntechnique is useful in Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman \\nsyndrome, in which a deletion in a segment of 15q11.2 occurs, \\nin Williams syndrome, known to be associated with a deletion \\nin 7q11.2, in velocardiofacial (DiGeorge) syndrome, which is \\nassociated with a deletion of 22q11.2, and in other disorders \\nin which a small duplication or deletion is known to occur.\\nMicroarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization\\nMicroarray comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) \\nhas essentially supplanted prophase analysis in cases in which \\na subtle copy number variant (chromosomal deletion or \\nduplication) is suspected. DNA from the individual being \\nstudied and a normal control are labeled with fluorescent \\nmarkers and hybridized to thousands of FISH-like probes for \\nsequences spread around the genome. The probes are derived \\nfrom known genes and noncoding regions. By analyzing the \\nratio of intensity of the fluorescent marker at each site, it is \\npossible to determine whether the individual has any difference \\nin copy number compared with the control DNA.\\nDirect DNA Analysis\\nDirect DNA analysis allows identification of mutations in a \\ngrowing number of genetic disorders.

Although this resembles congenital leukemia, it is a \\nself-limited condition, resolving on its own over the first month \\nof life. Nonetheless, children with DS also have an increased risk \\nof leukemia, with a 10- to 20-fold increase in risk compared with \\nindividuals without DS. In children with DS who are younger \\nthan 2 years of age, the type is generally acute megakaryoblastic \\nleukemia; in individuals older than 3 years of age, the types \\nof leukemia are similar to those of other children, with acute \\nlymphoblastic leukemia being the predominant type.\\nChildren with DS are more susceptible to infection, more \\nlikely to develop cataracts, and between 5% and 10% have \\natlantoaxial instability, an increased distance between the first \\nand second cervical vertebrae that may predispose to spinal \\ncord injury. Many individuals older than 35 years of age develop \\nAlzheimer-like features.\\nThe recurrence risk for parents who have had a child with \\nDS depends on the child’s cytogenetic findings. If the child has \\ntrisomy 21, the empiric recurrence risk is 1% (added to the \\nage-specific risk for women up to 40 years of age; after 40, the \\nage-specific risk alone is used for subsequent pregnancies). If  \\nthe child has a robertsonian translocation, chromosomal analysis \\nof both parents must be performed. In approximately 65% of \\ncases, the translocation is found to have arisen de novo (i.e., \\nspontaneously, with both parents having normal karyotypes), \\nand in 35% of cases, one parent has a balanced translocation. \\nThe recurrence risk depends on which parent is the carrier: \\nif the mother is the carrier, the risk is 10-15%; if the father is \\nthe carrier, the recurrence risk is 2-5%.\\nTrisomy 18\\nTrisomy 18 (47,XX,+18 or 47,XY ,+18) is the second most \\ncommon autosomal trisomy, occurring in approximately 1 in \\n7,500 live births. Virtually all cases of trisomy 18 are due to \\nnondisjunction. More than 95% of conceptuses with trisomy \\n18 are lost as spontaneous abortuses in the first trimester; females \\nare far more likely to survive to term than males; the ratio of \\nmale to female liveborns with trisomy 18 is 1  :  4. I nfants with \\ntrisomy 18 rarely survive; fewer than 10% will reach their first \\nbirthdays. Most infants with trisomy 18 are small for gestational \\nage. Clinical features include hypertonia, prominent occiput, \\nmicrognathia, low-set and malformed ears, short sternum, \\nrocker-bottom feet, hypoplastic nails, and characteristic clench-\\ning of fists—the second and fifth digits overlap the third and \\nfourth digits (Table 49.1).\\nTrisomy 13\\nThe third of the common trisomies, trisomy 13 (47,XX,+13 or \\n47,XY ,+13), occurs in 1 in 12,000 live births. As in trisomy 18, \\ntrisomy 13 is usually fatal in the first year of life, with only \\n8.6% of infants surviving beyond their first birthday.\\nAs in DS, trisomy 13 can be caused by nondisjunction (seen \\nin 75% of cases) or a robertsonian translocation (in 20%). The \\nmost common translocation involves chromosomes 13 and \\n14. Counseling regarding recurrence risk for future progeny \\nis similar to that described above for trisomy 21.\\nInfants with trisomy 13 have numerous malformations (see \\nTable 49.1). They are small for gestational age and microcephalic. \\nMidline facial defects such as cyclopia (single orbit), cebocephaly \\n(single nostril), and cleft lip and palate are common, as are \\nmidline central nervous system anomalies, such as alobar holo-\\nprosencephaly.

It occurs in approximately 1 of every 800 \\nbirths. Most cases (92.5%) are due to nondisjunction; in 68%, \\nthe nondisjunctional event occurs in maternal meiosis phase \\nI. As a result of nondisjunction, the fertilized egg contains three \\ncopies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21); using standard cyto-\\ngenetic nomenclature, trisomy 21 is designated 47,XX, +21 or \\n47,XY ,+21. In 4.5% of cases, the extra chromosome is part of \\na robertsonian translocation , which occurs when the long \\narms (q) of two acrocentric chromosomes (numbers 13, 14, \\n15, 21, or 22) fuse at the centromeres, and the short arms (p), \\ncontaining copies of ribosomal RNA, are lost. The most common \\nrobertsonian translocation leading to DS involves chromosomes \\n14 and 21; standard nomenclature is 46,XX,t(14q21q) or \\n46,XY ,t(14q21q). The parents of infants with DS who have \\ntranslocations should have a karyotype to exclude a balanced \\ntranslocation.\\nIn 1-2% of children with DS, mosaicism occurs. These indi-\\nviduals have two populations of cells: one with trisomy 21 and \\none with a normal chromosome complement. Mosaicism results \\neither from a nondisjunctional event that occurs sometime after \\nfertilization or from trisomic rescue. The loss of this aneuploidy \\nreturns the cell to 46,XX or 46,XY . In either case the individual \\nis referred to as a mosaic for these two populations of cells and \\nis designated 47,XX, +21/46XX or 47,XY ,+21/46,XY . Although \\nit is widely believed that individuals with mosaic DS are more \\nmildly affected, there are wide variations in clinical findings.\\nChildren with DS are usually diagnosed in the newborn \\nperiod. They tend to have normal birth weight and length, but \\nthey are hypotonic. The characteristic facial appearance, with \\nbrachycephaly, flattened occiput, hypoplastic midface, flattened \\nnasal bridge, upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, \\nand large protruding tongue, is often apparent at birth. Infants \\nalso have short broad hands, often with a single transverse \\npalmar crease, and a wide gap between the first and second toes. \\nHypotonia may cause feeding problems and decreased activity. \\nIntellectual disability is noted in almost all patients with DS.\\nAlmost half of all children with DS have congenital heart \\ndisease, including atrioventricular canal, ventriculoseptal or \\natrioseptal defects, and valvular disease. Between 5% and 10% \\nof newborns with DS have gastrointestinal tract anomalies. \\nThe three most common defects are duodenal atresia, annular \\npancreas, and imperforate anus.\\nFour percent to 18% of infants with DS are found to have \\ncongenital hypothyroidism, which is identified as part of the \\nnewborn screening program. Acquired hypothyroidism is a \\nmore common problem. Thyroid function must be monitored \\nperiodically during the child’s life.\\nPolycythemia at birth (hematocrit levels >70%) is common \\nand may require treatment.

About 15% of boys with features of KS are \\nfound to be mosaic, with 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism being the \\nmost common. Before puberty, boys with KS are phenotypically \\nindistinguishable from the rest of the population.\\nThe diagnosis is often made in adolescence when the hallmark \\nof the condition, under androgenation in the presence of testes \\nthat remain infantile in volume, should alert the clinician. \\nY oung adults with KS tend to be tall with long limbs. During \\nadolescence or adulthood, gynecomastia may occur.\\nBecause of failure of growth and maturation of the testes, \\nmales with KS have hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and \\nfailure to produce viable sperm. Low production of testicular \\ntestosterone results in failure to develop later secondary sexual \\ncharacteristics, such as facial hair, deepening of the voice, and \\nlibido. In adulthood, osteopenia and osteoporosis develop. \\nBecause of these findings, testosterone supplementation is \\nindicated.\\nMost men with KS are infertile because they produce few \\nviable sperm. Through the use of microdissection testicular \\nsperm extraction, a technique in which viable sperm are \\nisolated from testicular tissue, coupled with in vitro fertiliza-\\ntion and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, it is possible for \\nmen with KS to father children; all children born to these \\nmen using this technology have had a normal chromosome  \\ncomplement.\\nMonosomies\\nTurner Syndrome\\nmay occur. Postaxial polydactyly of the hands is common, as is \\nclubfeet or rocker-bottom feet. Hypospadias and cryptorchidism \\nare common in boys, whereas girls generally have hypoplasia of \\nthe labia minora. In addition, most infants with trisomy 13 have \\ncongenital heart disease. Many infants with trisomy 13 have \\na punched-out scalp lesion over the occiput called aplasia \\ncutis congenita; when seen in conjunction with polydactyly \\nand some or all the facial features, this finding is essentially \\npathognomonic for the diagnosis of trisomy 13.\\nKlinefelter Syndrome\\nTABLE 49.1 Possible Clinical Findings in Trisomy 13 and \\nTrisomy 18\\nTRISOMY 13 TRISOMY 18\\nHead and \\nface\\nScalp defects (e.g., cutis \\naplasia)\\nMicrophthalmia, corneal \\nabnormalities\\nCleft lip and palate in \\n60-80% of cases\\nMicrocephaly\\nSloping forehead\\nHoloprosencephaly \\n(arrhinencephaly)\\nCapillary hemangiomas\\nDeafness\\nSmall and premature \\nappearance\\nTight palpebral fissures\\nNarrow nose and \\nhypoplastic nasal alae\\nNarrow bifrontal diameter\\nProminent occiput\\nMicrognathia\\nCleft lip or palate\\nChest Congenital heart \\ndisease (e.g., VSD, PDA, \\nand ASD) in 80% of cases\\nThin posterior ribs \\n(missing ribs)\\nCongenital heart disease \\n(e.g., VSD, PDA, and \\nASD)\\nShort sternum, small \\nnipples\\nExtremities Overlapping of fingers \\nand toes (clinodactyly)\\nPolydactyly\\nHypoplastic nails, \\nhyperconvex nails\\nLimited hip abduction\\nClinodactyly and \\noverlapping fingers; \\nindex over third, fifth over \\nfourth\\nRocker-bottom feet \\nHypoplastic nails\\nGeneral Severe developmental \\ndelays and prenatal and \\npostnatal growth \\nretardation\\nRenal abnormalities\\nNuclear projections in \\nneutrophils\\nOnly 5% live >6 months\\nSevere developmental \\ndelays and prenatal and \\npostnatal growth \\nretardation\\nPremature birth, \\npolyhydramnios\\nInguinal or abdominal \\nhernias\\nOnly 5% live >1 year\\nASD, Atrial septal defect; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; VSD, ventricular septal \\ndefect.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nShort Stature\\nPubertal Delay\\nGynecomastia\\nOccurring in 1 in 1,000 births (1 in 500 males), KS is the most \\ncommon genetic cause of hypogonadism and infertility in men. \\nIt is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAmenorrhea\\nShort Stature\\nPubertal Delay\\nObesity\\nTS is the only condition in which a monosomic conceptus \\nsurvives to term; however, 99% of embryos with 45,X are \\nspontaneously aborted.

Features associated with the condition \\ninclude congenital heart disease (in 80%), with supravalvar \\naortic and pulmonic stenosis being the most common anomalies; \\ngrowth delay with short stature; a distinctive facial appearance, \\nwith median flare of the eyebrows, fullness of the perioral and \\nperiorbital region, blue irides with a stellate pattern of pigment, \\nand depressed nasal bridge with anteversion of the nares; \\nmoderate intellectual disability (average IQ 57) with strengths \\nin personal social skills and deficiencies in cognitive areas; and \\nhypercalcemia (in ~20%).\\nIndividuals with Williams syndrome often have a striking \\npersonality. Loquacious and gregarious, they are often described \\nas having a cocktail party personality. However, at least 10% \\nof children with Williams syndrome have features of autism \\nspectrum disorder. Patients occasionally have unusual musical \\nability. Most children with Williams syndrome have a de novo \\ndeletion. In rare cases, the deletion is inherited from a parent \\nin an autosomal dominant pattern.\\nAniridia Wilms Tumor Association\\nW AGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary \\nanomalies, and mental retardation) is caused by a deletion of \\n11p13. The deletion usually arises de novo, with rare cases \\nbeing associated with a balanced translocation in one of the \\nparents. Genitourinary abnormalities include cryptorchidism \\nand hypospadias. Patients often have short stature, and 50% \\nhave microcephaly. Wilms tumor develops in 50% of patients \\nwith aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retarda-\\ntion (see Chapter 159).\\nPrader-Willi Syndrome\\nSee Chapter 47.\\nAngelman Syndrome\\nSee Chapter 47.\\nChromosome 22q11.2 Deletion  \\nSyndromes (22q11DS)\\nprevents these women from developing secondary sexual \\ncharacteristics and results in amenorrhea. Although 10% of \\nwomen with TS may have normal pubertal development and are \\neven fertile, most affected women require estrogen replacement \\nto complete secondary sexual development.\\nInfertility in these women is not corrected by estrogen \\nreplacement. Assisted reproductive technology using donor \\nova has permitted women with TS to bear children. During \\npregnancy, these women must be followed carefully because \\npoststenotic dilatation of the aorta, leading to dissecting \\naneurysm, may occur.\\nMany girls with TS escape detection during the newborn \\nperiod because phenotypic features are subtle. One third of \\ngirls with TS are diagnosed in the newborn period because of \\nthe presence of physical features; another 33% are diagnosed \\nin childhood, often during a work-up for short stature (for \\nwhich, they may receive growth hormone therapy); the final \\none third are diagnosed during adolescence or adulthood when \\nthey fail to develop secondary sexual characteristics or during \\nwork-ups for infertility.\\nThe karyotypic spectrum in girls with TS is wide. Only \\n50% have a 45,X karyotype; 15% have an isochromosome \\nXq [46,X,i(Xq)], in which one X chromosome is represented \\nby two copies of the long arm (leading to a trisomy of Xq \\nand a monosomy of Xp); and approximately 25% are mosaic \\n(45,X/46,XX or 45,X/46,XY). Deletions involving the short (p) \\narm of the X chromosome (Xp22) produce short stature and \\ncongenital malformations, whereas deletions of the long arm \\n(Xq) cause gonadal dysgenesis.\\nAlthough monosomy X is caused by nondisjunction, TS is \\nnot associated with advanced maternal age. Rather, it is believed \\nthat the 45,X karyotype results from a loss of either an X or a \\nY chromosome after conception; that is, it is a postconceptual \\nmitotic (rather than meiotic) nondisjunctional event.\\nSYNDROMES INVOLVING  \\nCHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS\\nCri du Chat Syndrome\\nA deletion in the short arm of chromosome 5 is responsible \\nfor cri du chat syndrome, with its characteristic catlike cry \\nduring infancy, the result of tracheal hypoplasia. Other clinical \\nfeatures include low birth weight, postnatal failure to thrive, \\nhypotonia, developmental disability, microcephaly, and cra-\\nniofacial dysmorphism, including ocular hypertelorism, epi-\\ncanthal folds, downward obliquity of the palpebral fissures, \\nand low-set malformed ears. Clefts of the lip and palate, \\ncongenital heart disease, and other malformations may be seen.\\nThe clinical severity of cri du chat syndrome depends on the \\nsize of the deletion, with larger deletions associated with more \\nsevere expression. Most cases arise de novo, with rare cases \\nrelated to a balanced reciprocal chromosome translocation in \\na parent.

This etiology may be the presence of a mutation in a \\narch); and a characteristic facial appearance, characterized by \\na prominent nose and broad nasal root. Speech and language \\ndifficulties are common, as is mild intellectual impairment. \\nMore than 200 additional abnormalities have been identified in \\nindividuals with these conditions. About 70% have immunode-\\nficiency, largely related to T-cell dysfunction. A wide spectrum \\nof psychiatric disturbances, including schizophrenia and bipolar \\ndisorder, has been seen in at least one third of affected adults.\\nDamage to the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, embry-\\nonic structures that form parts of the cranial portion of the \\ndeveloping embryo, leads to abnormalities in the developing \\nface (clefting of the palate, micrognathia), the thymus gland, \\nthe parathyroid glands, and the conotruncal region of the heart. \\nThis spectrum of findings, called the DiGeorge malformation \\nsequence, is an important part of 22q11DS.\\nConfirmation of the deletion requires either fluorescence in \\nsitu hybridization (FISH) or chromosomal microarray analysis. \\nThe region, composed of about 3 million bases, contains between \\n30 and 40 genes. Although many of these deleted genes probably \\ncontribute to the phenotype, special attention has been focused \\non TBX1 and COMT, which are believed to be responsible for \\nmany of the features of the condition.\\nSYNDROMES INVOLVING  \\nCHROMOSOME DUPLICATION\\nDuplications and deletions occur secondary to misalignment \\nand unequal crossing over during meiosis. Small extra chro -\\nmosomes are found in a small percentage of the population \\n(0.06%). These “marker” chromosomes may be associated with \\nintellectual disabilities and other abnormalities, but they often \\nhave no apparent phenotypic effects.\\nInverted Duplication Chromosome 15\\nChromosome 15 is the most common of all marker chromo -\\nsomes, and its inverted duplication accounts for almost 40% \\nof this group of chromosomal abnormalities. Features seen in \\nchildren with 47,XX,+inv dup (15q) or 47,XY ,inv dup(15q) \\ndepend on the size of the extra chromosomal material present: \\nthe larger the region, the worse the prognosis. Common features \\nseen include varying degrees of developmental disability, autism \\nspectrum disorders, seizures, and behavioral issues. Minimal \\ndysmorphic features may be seen, including a sloping forehead, \\nshort and downward-slanting palpebral fissures, a prominent \\nnose with a broad nasal bridge, a long and well-defined philtrum, \\na midline crease in the lower lip, and micrognathia.\\nCat Eye Syndrome\\nNamed for the iris coloboma that gives patients’ eyes a catlike \\nappearance, cat eye syndrome is caused by the presence of a \\nsmall, extra chromosome composed of an inversion duplication \\nof 22q11. The two copies of 22q11 on this extra chromosome \\nplus the two normal copies of chromosome 22 result in four \\ncopies of this region. Although the colobomas name the \\nsyndrome, they occur in fewer than 50% of individuals with \\nthe marker chromosome. Other clinical features include mild \\nintellectual disability, behavioral disturbances, ocular hyper-\\ntelorism, downward-slanting palpebral fissures, micrognathia, \\nauricular pits and/or tags, anal atresia with rectovestibular \\nfistula, and renal agenesis.\\nTABLE 50.1 Glossary of Selected Terms Used in \\nDysmorphology\\nTERMS PERTAINING TO THE FACE AND HEAD\\nBrachycephaly: Condition in which head shape is shortened from \\nfront to back along the sagittal plane; the skull is rounder than \\nnormal\\nCanthus: The lateral or medial angle of the eye formed by the \\njunction of the upper and lower lids\\nColumella: The fleshy tissue of the nose that separates the nostrils\\nGlabella: Bony midline prominence of the brows\\nNasal alae: The lateral flaring of the nostrils\\nNasolabial fold: Groove that extends from the margin of the nasal \\nalae to the lateral aspects of the lips\\nOcular hypertelorism: Increased distance between the pupils of \\nthe two eyes\\nPalpebral fissure: The shape of the eyes based on the outline of \\nthe eyelids\\nPhiltrum: The vertical groove in the midline of the face between \\nthe nose and the upper lip\\nPlagiocephaly: Condition in which head shape is asymmetric in \\nthe sagittal or coronal planes; can result from asymmetry in suture \\nclosure or from asymmetry of brain growth\\nScaphocephaly: Condition in which the head is elongated from \\nfront to back in the sagittal plane; most normal skulls are \\nscaphocephalic\\nSynophrys: Eyebrows that meet in the midline\\nTelecanthus: A wide space between the medial canthi\\nTERMS PERTAINING TO THE EXTREMITIES\\nBrachydactyly: Condition of having short digits\\nCamptodactyly: Condition in which a digit is bent or fixed in the \\ndirection of flexion (a “trigger finger”–type appearance)\\nClinodactyly: Condition in which a digit is crooked and curves \\ntoward or away from adjacent digits\\nHypoplastic nail: An unusually small nail on a digit\\nMelia: Suffix meaning “limb” (e.g., amelia—missing limb; \\nbrachymelia—short limb)\\nPolydactyly: The condition of having six or more digits on an \\nextremity\\nSyndactyly: The condition of having two or more digits at least \\npartially fused (can involve any degree of fusion, from webbing of \\nskin to full bony fusion of adjacent digits)\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The V ACTERL association (vertebral \\nanomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, \\nrenal anomalies, and limb anomalies) is an example of a group of \\nmalformations that occur more commonly together than might \\nbe expected by chance. No single unifying etiology explains \\nthis condition, so it is considered an association.\\nIn approximately 50% of children noted to have one or \\nmore congenital malformations, only a single malformation \\nis identifiable; in the other 50%, multiple malformations are \\npresent. About 6% of infants with congenital malformations \\nhave chromosomal defects, 7.5% have a single gene disorder, \\n20% have conditions that are due to multifactorial effects (an \\ninterplay between genetic and environmental factors), and \\napproximately 7% are due to exposure to a teratogen. In more \\nthan 50% of cases, no cause can be identified.\\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nPregnancy History\\nIn attempting to solve the puzzle, the history of the pregnancy \\nand birth can reveal multiple factors that may prove helpful to \\nthe dysmorphologist. Infants who are small for gestational age \\nmay have a chromosome anomaly or may have been exposed \\nto a teratogen. Large for gestational age infants may be infants \\nof diabetic mothers or have an overgrowth syndrome, such as \\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. When evaluating an older \\nchild with intellectual disabilities, complications of extreme \\nprematurity may account for the child’s problems. Postmaturity \\nalso is associated with some chromosome anomalies (e.g., \\ntrisomy 18) and anencephaly. Infants born from breech presenta-\\ntion are more likely to have congenital malformations than \\nthose born from vertex.\\nAs a woman gets older, there is increased risk of nondis -\\njunction leading to trisomies. Advanced paternal age may \\nbe associated with the risk of a new mutation leading to an \\nautosomal dominant trait. Maternal medical problems and \\nexposures (medications, drugs, cigarette smoking, and alcohol \\nuse) are associated with malformations (see Chapters 48 and 59).\\nAn increased amount of amniotic fluid may be associated with \\nintestinal obstruction or a central nervous system anomaly that \\nleads to poor swallowing. A decreased amount of fluid may be \\nthe result of a chronic amniotic fluid leak or point to a urinary \\ntract abnormality that results in a failure to produce urine.\\nFamily History\\nA pedigree comprising at least three generations should be \\nconstructed, searching for similar or dissimilar abnormalities \\nin first- and second-degree relatives. A history of pregnancy \\nor neonatal losses should be documented. For a more detailed \\ndiscussion of pedigrees, see Chapter 47.\\nPhysical Examination\\nWhen examining children with dysmorphic features, the fol -\\nlowing approach should be used.\\nGrowth\\nThe height (length), weight, and head circumference should \\nbe measured carefully and plotted on appropriate growth curves. \\nSmall size or growth restriction may be secondary to a chro-\\nmosomal abnormality, skeletal dysplasia, or exposure to toxic \\nsingle gene, as is the case in Rett syndrome, a disorder caused \\nby a mutation in MECP2, a gene on Xq28; by the deletion or \\nduplication of genetic material, as in Prader-Willi syndrome, \\ncaused by the deletion of the paternal copy of the SNRPN gene on \\nchromosome 15q11.2; or by exposure to a teratogenic substance \\nduring embryonic development, as in fetal alcohol spectrum  \\ndisorder.\\nDEFINITIONS\\nCongenital malformations are defined as clinically significant \\nabnormalities in either form or function that are identifiable \\nat birth. They result from localized intrinsic defects in mor -\\nphogenesis, which were caused by an event that occurred in \\nembryonic or early fetal life. This event may have been a dis-\\nturbance of development from some unknown cause, but often \\nmutations in developmental genes lead to the abnormality. \\nExtrinsic factors may cause disruptions of development result-\\ning from disturbances to the development of apparently normal \\ntissues. These disruptions may include amniotic bands, disrup-\\ntion of blood supply to developing tissues, or exposure to \\nteratogens. A malformation sequence is a spectrum of \\nabnormalities, including malformations, deformations, and \\ndisruptions that result from the effects of a single malformation. \\nFor instance, in the Pierre Robin sequence, a primary malforma-\\ntion, the failure of growth of the mandible during the first \\nweeks of gestation results in micrognathia, which forces the \\nnormal-sized tongue into an unusual position. The abnormally-\\npositioned tongue blocks the fusion of the palatal shelves, which \\nnormally come together in the midline to produce the hard \\nand soft palate; this leads to the presence of a U-shaped cleft  \\npalate. After delivery, the normal-sized tongue in the smaller-\\nthan-normal sized oral cavity leads to airway obstruction, a \\npotentially life-threatening complication. So, the triad of features \\ncomprising the Pierre Robin sequence (micrognathia, U-shaped \\ncleft palate, and obstructive apnea) all result from the failure \\nof the jaw to grow at a critical time during gestation.\\nMalformation sequences can occur alone or may be part of \\na multiple malformation syndrome. For instance, individuals \\nwith Pierre Robin sequence may have it as part of Stickler \\nsyndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations \\nin collagen genes. Stickler syndrome also manifests with ocular \\nand musculoskeletal abnormalities.\\nDeformations arise as a result of environmental forces acting \\non normal structures. They occur later in pregnancy or after \\ndelivery. For instance, plagiocephaly (rhomboid shaped head) \\nmay result from intrauterine positioning or from torticollis \\nexperienced in the newborn period. Deformations often resolve \\nwith minimal intervention, but malformations often require \\nsurgical and medical management.\\nMinor malformations, variants of normal that occur in \\nless than 3% of the population, include findings such as single \\ntransverse palmar creases, low-set ears, or ocular hypertelorism \\n(wide-spaced eyes); when isolated, they have no clinical signifi-\\ncance. A multiple malformation syndrome is the recognizable \\npattern of anomalies that results from a single identifiable \\nunderlying cause. It may involve a series of malformations, \\nmalformation sequences, and deformations. These syndromes \\noften prompt a consultation with a clinical geneticist.\\nAn association differs from a syndrome in that in the former, \\nno single underlying etiology explains the recognizable pattern \\nof anomalies that occur together more often than would be \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

If this retrusion is pronounced, the child may have \\nthe Pierre Robin malformation sequence. In addition, the \\nmouth should be examined. The number and appearance of \\nthe teeth should be noted, the tongue should be observed for \\nabnormalities, and the palate and uvula checked for defects.\\nNeck\\nExamination of the neck may reveal webbing, a common feature \\nin Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome, or shortening, as \\nis seen occasionally in some skeletal dysplasias and in condi-\\ntions in which anomalies of the cervical spine occur, such as \\nKlippel-Feil syndrome. The position of the posterior hairline \\nalso should be evaluated. The size of the thyroid gland should be  \\nassessed.\\nTrunk\\nThe chest may be examined for shape (shield-like chest in \\nNoonan syndrome and Turner syndrome) and for symmetry. \\nThe presence of a pectus deformity should be noted and is \\ncommon in Marfan syndrome. The presence of scoliosis should \\nbe assessed; it is common in Marfan syndrome and many other \\nsyndromes.\\nExtremities\\nMany congenital malformation syndromes are associated with \\nanomalies of the extremities. All joints should be examined \\nfor range of motion. The presence of single or multiple joint \\ncontractures suggests either intrinsic neuromuscular dysfunction, \\nas in some forms of muscular dystrophy, or external deforming \\nforces that limited motion of the joint in utero. Multiple \\ncontractures also are found with arthrogryposis multiplex \\ncongenita and are due to a variety of causes. Radioulnar \\nsynostosis, an inability to pronate or supinate the elbow, occurs \\nin fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and in some X chromosome \\naneuploidy syndromes.\\nExamination of the hands is important. Polydactyly (the \\npresence of extra digits) usually occurs as an isolated autosomal \\ndominant trait but also can be seen in trisomy 13. Oligodactyly \\n(a deficiency in the number of digits) is seen in Fanconi anemia \\n(anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and associated heart, \\nrenal, and limb anomalies—usually radial aplasia and thumb \\nmalformation or aplasia), in which it is generally part of a \\nmore severe limb reduction defect, or secondary to intrauterine \\namputation, which may occur with amniotic band disruption \\nsequence. Syndactyly (a joining of two or more digits) is \\ncommon to many syndromes, including Smith-Lemli-Opitz \\nsyndrome.\\nDermatoglyphics include palmar crease patterns. A \\ntransverse palmar crease, indicative of hypotonia during early \\nfetal life, is seen in approximately 50% of children with Down \\nsyndrome (and 10% of individuals in the general population). A \\ncharacteristic palmar crease pattern is also seen in fetal alcohol \\nspectrum disorder.\\nGenitalia\\nor teratogenic agents. Larger than expected size suggests an \\novergrowth syndrome (Sotos or Beckwith-Wiedemann syn-\\ndrome) or, in the newborn period, might suggest a diabetic \\nmother.\\nThe clinician should note if the child is proportionate. Limbs \\nthat are too short for the head and trunk imply the presence \\nof a short-limbed bone dysplasia, such as achondroplasia.

Asymmetry \\nmay be due to a deformation related to intrauterine position \\nor a malformation of one side of the face. The face should \\nbe divided into four regions, which are evaluated separately. \\nThe forehead may show overt prominence (achondroplasia) \\nor deficiency (often described as a sloping appearance, which \\noccurs in children with primary microcephaly). The midface, \\nextending from the eyebrows to the upper lip and from the \\nouter canthi of the eyes to the commissures of the mouth, is \\nespecially important. Careful assessment of the distance between \\nthe eyes (inner canthal distance) and the pupils (interpupillary \\ndistance) may confirm the impression of hypotelorism (eyes \\nthat are too close together), which suggests a defect in midline \\nbrain formation, or hypertelorism (eyes that are too far apart). \\nThe length of the palpebral fissure should be noted and may \\nhelp define whether the opening for the eye is short, as is found \\nwith fetal alcohol syndrome, or excessively long, as in Kabuki \\nsyndrome (short stature, intellectual disability, long palpebral \\nfissures with eversion of lateral portion of lower lid).\\nOther features of the eyes should be noted. The obliquity \\n(slant) of the palpebral fissures may be upward (as seen with \\nDown syndrome) or downward (as in Treacher Collins syn-\\ndrome). The presence of epicanthal folds (Down syndrome \\nand fetal alcohol syndrome) is also important. Features of the \\nnose—especially the nasal bridge, which can be flattened in \\nDown syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and many other syn-\\ndromes, or prominent as in velocardiofacial syndrome—should \\nbe noted.\\nThe malar region of the face is examined next. It extends \\nfrom the ear to the midface. The ears should be checked for \\nsize (measured and checked against appropriate growth charts), \\nshape, position (low-set ears are below a line drawn from the \\nouter canthus to the occiput), and orientation (posterior rotation \\nis where the ear appears turned toward the rear of the head). \\nEars may be low set because they are small (or microtic) or \\nbecause of a malformation of the mandibular region.\\nThe mandibular region is the area from the lower portion \\nof the ears bounded out to the chin by the mandible.

In many cases, all laboratory tests are normal, \\nand confirmation relies on subjective findings. Clinical geneti-\\ncists have attempted to resolve this difficulty by developing \\nscoring systems, cross-referenced tables of anomalies that help \\nin the development of a differential diagnosis, and computerized \\ndiagnostic programs. An accurate diagnosis is important for \\nthe following reasons:\\n1. I t offers an explanation to the family why their child was \\nborn with congenital anomalies. This may help allay guilt \\nfor parents, who often believe they are responsible for their \\nchild’s problem.\\n2. W ith well-described natural histories of many disorders, a \\ndiagnosis allows anticipation of medical problems associated \\nwith a particular syndrome and appropriate screening. It \\nalso provides reassurance that other medical problems are \\nno more likely to occur than they might with other children \\nwho do not have the diagnosis.\\n3. I t permits genetic counseling to be done to identify the risk \\nto future children and permits prenatal testing to be done \\nfor the disorders for which it is available.\\nDiagnosis enables the clinician to provide the family with \\neducational materials about the diagnosis and facilitate contact \\nwith support groups for particular disorders. The Internet has \\nbecome an important source for such information. Care should \\nbe exercised, as information on the Internet is not subject to edi-\\ntorial control and may be inaccurate. A good site is the National \\nOrganization for Rare Disorders (http://www.rarediseases.org), \\na clearinghouse for information about rare diseases and their \\nsupport groups. Genetic testing information is available at the \\nGeneTests website (http://www.genetests.org).

In boys, if the penis appears short, it should be \\nmeasured and compared with known age-related data.

Females have two X \\nchromosomes (46,XX), and males have a Y chromosome \\n(46,XY).\\n• Genes are stretches of DNA that code for a protein. A typical \\ngene has a promoter sequence, an untranslated region, and \\nan open reading frame.\\n• Every three nucleotides represent a single codon that codes \\nfor a particular amino acid.\\n• Some codons act as a start signal and others as a stop signal \\nfor transcription.\\n• Within the gene there are regions—exons—that code for \\nthe sequence of the protein, and introns, which are not \\nincorporated into the transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA).\\n• Less than 2% of the 3.1 million DNA bases code for proteins. \\nThese regions represent about 21,000 genes. Alternative \\nsplicing of the transcribed mRNA can generate a possible \\n100,000 proteins.\\n• Changes in the DNA sequence can lead to changes in the \\namino acid in a protein (missense mutations) or to a pre -\\nmature stop codon (nonsense mutation).\\n• A third change in the DNA is frameshift mutation, which \\nis the result of the addition or deletion of one or more DNA \\nbases that “shifts” the reading from of the codons usually \\nresulting in production of a new stop codon that is before \\nthe end of the gene and is considered “premature. ”\\nPedigrees\\n• Pedigrees are symbolic depictions of a family’s history with \\nsymbols for males (squares) and females (circles).\\n• Pedigrees permit a quick visual determination of an inheri-\\ntance pattern in a family.\\nAutosomal Dominant Disorders\\n• A single copy of a mutation not on a sex chromosome that \\nresults in disease.\\n• Affected parents have a 50% chance of passing mutation on \\nto each child.\\n• The phenomenon where some patients with the mutation \\nshow clinical symptoms and others may not is called pen -\\netrance. Many autosomal dominant (AD) disorders can show \\ndecreased penetrance.\\n• Variable expressivity describes the phenomenon where \\ndifferent family members may vary in the severity of clinical \\nsymptoms and which clinical symptoms are manifest.\\n• Often, patients with an AD disorder may be new mutations \\n(they have unaffected parents).\\nAutosomal Recessive Disorders\\n• Both copies of gene on a non-sex chromosome have a \\nmutation.\\n• Affected patients usually have unaffected parents, each of \\nwhom is a carrier for the disorder.\\nX-linked Disorders (General)\\n• Females have two copies of the X-chromosome; males have \\none X-Chromosome and a Y chromosome.\\n• The X-chromosome has approximately 2,000 genes, the Y \\nabout 200.\\n• Females randomly inactivate one of their X-chromosomes \\n(Lyonization).\\nX-linked Recessive Inheritance\\n• Most X chromosome disorders show recessive \\ninheritance.\\n• Males, having one X-chromosome, are more likely to manifest \\ndisease than females.\\n• Sons of carrier females have a 50% chance of being affected; \\ndaughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier.\\n• Daughters of affected males have a 50% chance of being a \\ncarrier; all sons are unaffected.\\nX-linked Dominant\\n• Females with these disorders show symptoms.\\n• Females are usually less affected than males due to \\nX-chromosome inactivation.\\n• Some X-linked dominant disorders are lethal in males with \\ndeath before birth.\\nMitochondrial Inheritance\\n• Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replicates independently from \\nnuclear DNA.\\n• Virtually all mitochondria are supplied by the oocyte.\\n• mtDNA has a few genes that code for respiratory complex \\nproteins (most are coded on the nuclear DNA) and a set of \\ntRNAs that are needed for protein synthesis within the \\nmitochondria.\\n• Disorders involving the mtDNA are maternally inherited.\\n• There are many mitochondria in each cell. If the DNA is \\ndifferent in some of these mitochondria (two populations), \\nthis is referred to as heteroplasmy.\\n• There are some disorders due to loss or deficiency of mito-\\nchondria. This is referred to as mitochondrial depletion.\\nUniparental Disomy\\n• Patients with Uniparental Disomy have a normal karyotype \\nwith a normal number of chromosomes.\\n• The affected chromosome will be identical—two copies of \\none parent’s chromosome—without a copy from the other \\nparent.\\n• Some genes are methylated (“inactivated”) depending on \\ntheir parental origin. Having uniparental disomy might result \\nin both copies of the gene being inactivated.\\nMultifactorial Inheritance\\n• Result from the interplay of genetic and environmental \\nfactors.\\n• About 20% of congenital malformations are due to multifacto-\\nrial inheritance.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Delay in diagnosis may \\nresult in end-organ damage including progressive neurological \\ninjury or death.\\nWith the exception of phenylketonuria (PKU), and medium-\\nchain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, most \\nmetabolic disorders are individually rare, having an incidence \\nof less than 1 per 100,000 births in the United States. When \\nconsidered collectively, the incidence may approach 1 in 800 \\nto 2,500 births (Table 51.1) with the prevalence of a confirmed \\nmetabolic disorder detected by newborn screening in 1 in 4,000 \\nlive births (about 12,500 diagnoses each year) in the United \\nStates. This is comparable with the 1 in 1,000 infants who have \\nearly-onset bacterial sepsis and the 1 in 3,000 infants who have \\ninvasive group B streptococcal infections.\\nIEMs are frequent causes of sepsis-like presentations, intel-\\nlectual disability, seizures, sudden infant death, and neurological \\nimpairment. Indeed there are 89 identified IEMs that are \\namenable to therapy targeted to the underlying cause, which \\npresent with intellectual disability as a prominent feature.\\nSingle gene disorders are estimated to account for up to 35% \\nof neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions and 20% of \\ngeneral admissions to a regional children’s hospital. Congenital \\nanomalies and single gene disorders are the leading cause of \\ndeath in the NICU and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\\nMetabolic disorders can be classified using a variety of \\nschemes based on the clinical presentation, including the age \\nof onset, the tissues or organ systems involved, the defective \\nmetabolic pathways, or the subcellular localization of the \\nunderlying defect. These classification schemes have differing \\nutility when considering approach to diagnosis, management, \\nand screening strategies. The clinical presentation and long-term \\nprognosis have the most bearing on management of children \\nwith genetic metabolic disorders.\\nGenetic metabolic disorders result from the deficiency of an \\nenzyme, its cofactors, or biochemical transporters that lead to \\nthe deficiency of a required metabolite, the buildup of a toxic \\ncompound, or a combination of both processes (Fig. 51.1, Table \\n51.2). Understanding which of these mechanisms is involved and \\nif the effects are systemic or restricted to the local tissue enables \\na rational approach to diagnosis, therapy, and management.\\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nSeizures and Other Paroxysmal Disorders\\nAltered Mental Status\\nIrritable Infant\\nThe signs and symptoms of an inborn error are diverse and \\ncan involve any organ system. The presentation varies among \\nage groups. IEMs often present a few hours to weeks after \\nbirth, often mimicking late-onset sepsis. Infants who survive \\nthe neonatal period without developing recognized symptoms \\noften experience intermittent illness separated by periods of \\nbeing well. While pursuing the evaluation of the specific clinical \\npresentations (e.g., the approach to the sick newborn, irritable \\nchild, or child with liver dysfunction), the hypoglycemic and \\nintoxicating (encephalopathy) metabolic disorders should \\nbe considered in all neonates presenting with lethargy, poor \\ntone, poor feeding, hypothermia, irritability, or seizures. In \\nmost cases these should be evaluated by assessment of plasma \\nammonia, blood glucose, and anion gap (Fig. 51.2). Significant \\nketosis in the neonate is unusual and suggests an organic acid \\ndisorder. Similarly, specific metabolic disorders predispose to \\ncardiomyopathy, myopathy, hepatopathy, developmental delay, \\nsepsis, and developmental regression; appropriate evaluation \\nshould be tailored to the clinical presentation.\\nIntroduction of new foods or metabolic stress associated with \\nfasting or fever may unmask an inborn error of metabolism \\nduring infancy or in older children. The introduction of fructose \\nor sucrose in the diet may lead to decompensation in hereditary \\nfructose intolerance.

A positive \\nscreening test must be followed by prompt clinical assessment \\nas recommended by the screening program and/or metabolic \\nspecialist. In many cases children will also be provided therapy \\nuntil the completion of definitive testing.\\nA positive screening test result causes anxiety for new parents; \\nmanagement of such anxiety is essential to minimize the harm \\nof the program. In addition, definitive testing must be carried \\nout promptly and accurately. If an inborn error of metabolism \\nis excluded, parents need a thorough explanation of the results \\nand reassurance that the infant is well. Such explanations will \\nfrequently require the expertise of a metabolic specialist or \\ngenetic counselor in the newborn period but may require \\nreassessment of parental understanding by the primary care \\nphysician in the long term.\\nSpecialized Laboratory and Clinical Testing\\nSpecialized testing for inherited disorders of metabolism is \\neffective in confirming a diagnosis suspected on the basis of \\nan abnormal newborn screening result or on the basis of clinical \\nsuspicion. The tests that are helpful and examples of diagnoses \\nmade using these measurements depend on the deficient pathway \\nin the disorder under consideration (Table 51.9).\\nAmino acid analysis is performed in plasma, urine, and \\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The plasma amino acid profile is most \\nuseful in identifying disorders of amino acid catabolism. Amino \\nacids may also be abnormal in specific disorders of organic \\nacid degradation, but often they are normal or not diagnostic.\\nThe urine amino acid profile is helpful in diagnosing primary \\ndisorders of renal tubular function, such as Lowe syndrome and \\ncystinuria, as well as secondary disorders of renal tubular func-\\ntion, such as cystinosis and Fanconi syndrome of any cause. The \\ntest may also be useful in screening for several disorders of amino \\nacid transport such as the detection of urinary homocitrulline \\nin hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria \\n(HHH) syndrome. The urine amino acid profile is not the test \\nof choice for diagnosing disorders of amino acid or organic \\nacid metabolism.\\nMarkers of disordered fatty acid oxidation are measured in \\nurine and plasma. Excessive intermediates of fatty acid oxida-\\ntion and organic acid catabolism are conjugated with glycine \\nand carnitine. The urine acylglycine profile and the plasma \\nacylcarnitine profile reflect this accumulation. In organic acid \\ndisorders and fatty acid oxidation disorders, measurement of \\nplasma carnitine may reveal a secondary deficiency of carnitine \\nand abnormal distribution of free and acylated carnitine. The \\nplasma free fatty acid (nonesterified fatty acid) to 3-OH-butyrate \\nratio is helpful in the diagnosis of disorders of fatty acid oxi-\\ndation. Excess 3-OH-butyrate suggests a disorder of ketone \\nmetabolism; absence of ketones or decreased 3-OH-butyrate \\nsuggests a fatty acid oxidation disorder. Profiling of fatty acid \\nintermediates in cultured skin fibroblasts may be informative.\\nDisorders of organic acid metabolism, such as propionic \\nacidemia and methylmalonic acidemia, have typical urine \\norganic acid profiles. Although analysis of blood and urine \\npopulations (e.g., MSUD in the Old Order Mennonite population \\nin Pennsylvania). X-linked conditions exhibit increased presenta-\\ntion in males. In general, carriers of recessive or X-linked diseases \\nare usually asymptomatic. However, in ornithine transcarba-\\nmylase (OTC; also known as ornithine carbamoyltransferase) \\ndeficiency or Fabry disease, females can be symptomatic if  \\nthey have a low proportion of unaffected cells (unfavorable \\nX-inactivation). Most mitochondrial disorders in children are \\na result of pathogenic variants in autosomal genes, although \\nthere are X-linked forms. Pathogenic variants in the mitochon-\\ndrial DNA also lead to mitochondrial disease. In this situation \\nthe type and severity of the presentation depend on the specific \\ndefects and the tissue-specific ratio of normal to abnormal copies \\nof the mitochondrial DNA (the degree of heteroplasmy).\\nIdentification of Molecular Pathology\\nIf the molecular basis of an inborn error of metabolism is \\nknown (i.e., the gene or genes have been mapped and disease-\\ncausing variants defined), specific genetic testing may be \\nclinically available. In some disorders there is a good correlation \\nbetween specific disease-causing variants and clinical outcome. \\nGenetic testing in other at-risk family members can provide \\nimportant genetic information for them, potentially enabling \\npresymptomatic therapy and alternate decision making through-\\nout the rest of the family.\\nIDENTIFICATION OF INBORN ERRORS BY \\nNEONATAL SCREENING\\nDisorders Identified by Neonatal Screening\\nIn the United States the majority of infants diagnosed with a \\ntreatable metabolic disorder will be identified as a result of  \\nan abnormal newborn screen. Most states use tandem mass  \\nspectrometry to screen for a core panel of metabolic disorders \\n(Table 51.8). Proposed additions or removal of conditions recom-\\nmended for screening are evaluated by the federal advisory \\ncommittee on heritable disorders in the newborn and child \\n(ACHDNC). Approved conditions are then included in the \\n“recommended uniform screening panel” (RUSP). In most states, \\nbiotinidase deficiency and galactosemia are typically screened \\nfor by evaluating enzyme function. Two storage disorders \\n(mucopolysaccharidosis type 1[MPS1], Hurler, Hurler-Schei, \\nand Schei diseases) and Pompe disease (GSDII) as well as one \\ndisorder of peroxisomal function (ALD) have been added to \\nthe RUSP . The lysosomal storage disorders may be detected by \\nenzymatic function with degradation products detected through \\ncolorimetry or tandem mass spectrometry. The peroxisomal \\ndisorder is detected by looking for an analyte detected using a \\ntandem mass spectrometer in a different mode.\\nStrategy of Neonatal Screening\\nThe purpose of neonatal screening is the early detection and \\nrapid treatment of disorders before the onset of symptoms, \\nthus preventing morbidity and mortality. In most states, infants \\nare tested at 24-48 hours (see Chapter 58). A positive test \\ndemands prompt evaluation. Specific follow-up testing and \\ntreatment of an affected child depends on the disorder. Con-\\nsistent with most screening tests, a significant proportion of \\ninfants who have a positive neonatal screening test do not have \\na metabolic disorder.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Glycogen is synthesized from uridine \\ndiphosphoglucose through the concerted action of glycogen \\nsynthetase and brancher enzyme (Fig. 52.1). The accumulation \\nof glycogen is stimulated by insulin. Glycogenolysis occurs \\nthrough a cascade initiated by epinephrine or glucagon. It results \\nin rapid phosphorolysis of glycogen to yield glucose 1-phosphate, \\naccompanied by, to a lesser degree, hydrolysis of glucose residues \\nfrom the branch points in glycogen molecules. In the liver and \\nkidneys, glucose 1-phosphate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate \\nthrough the actions of phosphoglucomutase; glucose 6-phos-\\nphatase hydrolyses glucose 6-phosphate to produce glucose. \\nThe latter enzyme is not present in muscles. Glycogen storage \\ndiseases fall into the following four categories:\\n1. Di seases that predominantly affect the liver and have a direct \\ninfluence on blood glucose (types I, VI, and VIII)\\n2. Di seases that predominantly involve muscles and affect the \\nability to do anaerobic work (types V and VII)\\n3. Di seases that can affect the liver and muscles and directly \\ninfluence blood glucose and muscle metabolism (type III)\\n4. Di seases that affect various tissues but have no direct effect \\non blood glucose or on the ability to do anaerobic work \\n(types II and IV)\\nThe diagnosis of type I or type III glycogen storage disease \\nis suggested by elevated uric acid, lactate, and triglycerides in \\nblood. For all forms, a diagnosis can normally be confirmed by \\nDNA testing. When this is feasible, invasive procedures, such as \\nmuscle and liver biopsy, can be avoided. When DNA testing is \\nnot available or is inconclusive, enzyme measurements in tissue \\nfrom the affected organ confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis \\ncannot be established, metabolic challenge and exercise testing \\nmay be needed. Treatment of hepatic glycogen storage disease \\nis aimed at maintaining satisfactory blood glucose levels or \\nsupplying alternative energy sources to muscle. In glucose-\\n6-phosphatase deficiency (type I), the treatment usually requires \\nnocturnal intragastric feedings of glucose during the first 1 \\nor 2 years of life. Thereafter, snacks and uncooked cornstarch \\nmay be satisfactory; however, many centers also use nocturnal \\nintragastric feedings. Hepatic tumors (sometimes malignant) are \\na threat in adolescence and adult life. No specific treatment exists \\nfor the diseases of muscle that impair skeletal muscle ischemic \\nThe correct tissue for enzymatic confirmation depends on \\nthe disorder, and in many cases may be measured on white \\nblood cells or cultured skin fibroblasts. Consequently, such \\nsamples should only be collected after review of the testing \\nlaboratory’s requirements.\\nIn many disorders, an abnormal metabolic profile is consistently \\npresent during illness and when the child is well. In some cases, \\nit is only diagnostic during an episode of illness.\\nOVERVIEW OF TREATMENT\\nThere are several basic principles for treatment of IEMs. \\nSyndromes with toxicity often present with encephalopathy; \\nremoval of toxic compounds is the first goal of therapy. Strategies \\ninclude hemodialysis, hemovenovenous filtration, and admin-\\nistration of alternate pathway agents (see Chapter 53). A second \\nstrategy is to enhance deficient enzyme activity through \\nadministration of enzyme cofactors (e.g., pyridoxine in homo-\\ncystinuria, tetrahydrobiopterin in PKU). If deficiency of a \\npathway product plays an important role, providing missing \\nproducts is helpful (e.g., tyrosine in the treatment of PKU). A \\nfurther principle is to decrease flux through the deficient pathway \\nby restricting precursors in the diet. Examples include the \\nrestriction of protein in disorders of ammonia detoxification, \\nphenylalanine in PKU, and of amino acid precursors in the \\norganic acid disorders.\\nCHAPTER 52 \\nCarbohydrate Disorders\\nGLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASES\\nMany glycogen storage diseases are characterized by hypo-\\nglycemia and hepatomegaly (Table 52.1).

Galactitol, acting as an \\nosmotic agent, can be responsible for cataract formation and, \\nrarely, for increased intracranial pressure. These are the only \\nclinical manifestations.

Elimina-\\ntion of fructose and sucrose from the diet prevents clinical \\ndisease. Fructosuria is caused by fructokinase deficiency, but \\nits deficiency is not associated with clinical consequences.\\nCHAPTER 53 \\nAmino Acid Disorders\\nDISORDERS OF AMINO ACID METABOLISM\\nDisorders of amino acid metabolism are the result of the inability \\nto catabolize specific amino acids derived from protein. Usually \\na single amino acid pathway is involved. This amino acid \\naccumulates in excess and is toxic to various organs, such as \\nthe brain, eyes, skin, or liver. Treatment is directed at the specific \\npathway and usually involves dietary restriction of the offending \\namino acid and supplementation with special medical foods \\n(formulas) that provide the other amino acids and other \\nnutrients. Confirmatory testing includes quantitative specific \\nplasma amino acid profiles along with specific pathogenic variant \\ntesting and sometimes enzymology.\\nPHENYLKETONURIA\\nPhenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disease, primar-\\nily affects the brain and occurs in 1 in 10,000 persons. Classic \\nPKU is the result from a defect in the hydroxylation of phe-\\nnylalanine to form tyrosine (Fig. 53.1); the activity of phenyl -\\nalanine hydroxylase in the liver is absent or greatly reduced. \\nAffected infants are normal at birth, but if untreated, severe \\nintellectual disability (IQ 30) develops in the first year of life. \\nA positive newborn screening test must be followed up by \\nperforming quantitative plasma amino acid analysis. A plasma \\nphenylalanine value of greater than 360  µM (6  m g/dL) is \\nconsistent with the diagnosis of one of the hyperphenylalanin-\\nemias and demands prompt evaluation and treatment. Untreated, \\nclassic PKU is characterized by blood phenylalanine concentra-\\ntions higher than 600 µM. Milder forms of hyperphenylalanin-\\nemia are indicated by values of plasma phenylalanine lower \\nthan this but higher than 360 µM. A significant percentage of \\npremature infants and a few full-term infants have transient \\nelevations in phenylalanine. Short-term follow-up usually \\nexercise. Enzyme replacement early in life is effective in Pompe \\ndisease (type II), which involves cardiac and skeletal muscle.\\nGALACTOSEMIA\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nVisual Impairment and Leukocoria\\nJaundice\\nHepatomegaly\\nAlkalemia\\nGalactosemia is an autosomal recessive disease caused by \\ndeficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (Fig. \\n52.2). Clinical manifestations are most striking in a neonate \\nwho, when fed milk, generally exhibits evidence of liver failure \\n(hyperbilirubinemia, disorders of coagulation, hypoglycemia), \\ndisordered renal tubular function (acidosis, glycosuria, ami-\\nnoaciduria), and cataracts. The neonatal screening test must \\nhave a rapid turnaround time because affected infants may die \\nin the first week of life. Affected infants are at increased risk \\nfor severe neonatal Escherichia coli sepsis. Major effects on \\nliver and kidney function and the development of cataracts are \\nlimited to the first few years of life; older children may have \\nlearning disorders despite dietary compliance. Girls usually \\ndevelop premature ovarian failure despite treatment.\\nLaboratory manifestations of galactosemia depend on \\ndietary galactose intake. When galactose is ingested (as lactose), \\nlevels of plasma galactose and erythrocyte galactose 1-phosphate \\nare elevated. Hypoglycemia is frequent, and albuminuria is \\npresent. Galactose frequently is present in the urine and can be \\ndetected by a positive reaction for reducing substances without a \\nreaction with glucose oxidase on urine strip tests. The absence of \\nurinary reducing substances cannot be relied on to exclude the \\ndiagnosis. The diagnosis is made by showing extreme reduction \\nin erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity. \\nDNA testing for pathogenic variants in galactose-1-phosphate \\nuridyltransferase confirms the diagnosis and may be useful \\nin predicting prognosis.

Elevated tyrosine levels also occur as \\na nonspecific consequence of severe liver disease or transient \\ntyrosinemia of the newborn, which responds to ascorbic acid \\ntreatment. The inherited disorders of tyrosine metabolism are \\na target of neonatal screening. Tyrosinemia type I, which is \\ndue to fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency (see Fig. 53.1), \\nis a rare disease in which accumulated metabolites produce \\nsevere liver disease associated with bleeding disorder, hypo-\\nglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated transaminases, and defects \\nin renal tubular function. Hepatocellular carcinoma may \\neventually occur. Quantitative measurement of plasma tyrosine \\nand blood or urine succinylacetone is performed after a positive \\nneonatal screen. The diagnosis of tyrosinemia I is confirmed \\nby an increased concentration of succinylacetone; DNA testing \\nis available. Treatment with nitisinone (NTBC; an inhibitor \\nof the oxidation of parahydroxyphenylpyruvic acid) effectively \\neliminates the production of the toxic succinylacetone. A low-\\nphenylalanine, low-tyrosine diet may also play a role. These \\ntreatments have obviated the immediate need for liver trans-\\nplantation in children identified by neonatal screening. Whether \\nthey completely eliminate the occurrence of hepatocellular \\ncarcinoma is the focus of ongoing studies.\\nTyrosinemias II and III are more benign forms of hereditary \\ntyrosinemia. Blocked metabolism of tyrosine at earlier steps in \\nthe pathway is responsible, and succinylacetone is not produced. \\nThe clinical features include hyperkeratosis of palms and \\nsoles and keratitis, which can cause severe visual disturbance. \\nSignificant elevations of tyrosine levels are associated with mild \\nidentifies these infants promptly. A small percentage of infants \\ndiagnosed with PKU (≤2% in the United States) have a defect \\nin the synthesis or metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin, the \\ncofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase and for other enzymes \\ninvolved in the intermediary metabolism of aromatic amino \\nacids. Such disorders in biopterin metabolism are diagnosed \\nby measuring dihydrobiopterin reductase in erythrocytes and \\nby analyzing biopterin metabolites in urine. This testing should \\nbe carried out in all hyperphenylalaninemic infants.\\nTreatment is designed to maintain plasma phenylalanine \\nvalues in the therapeutic range of 120-360  mM u sing a diet \\nspecifically restricted in phenylalanine but otherwise nutri -\\ntionally complete. Since the early 1980s, treatment for life is \\nrecommended to reduce the risks of long-term neuropsychiatric \\nproblems and reduce the risk of maternal PKU syndrome.\\nOutcome of treatment in classic PKU is excellent. Most \\ninfants with classic PKU who are treated within the first 10 days \\nof life achieve normal intelligence. However, learning problems \\nand problems with executive function are more frequent than \\nin unaffected peers. The safe concentration of phenylalanine \\nin older children and adults with PKU has not been clearly \\nestablished. Reversible cognitive dysfunction is associated \\nwith acute elevations of plasma phenylalanine in adults and \\nchildren with PKU. If the elevated level has been sustained, the \\ndysfunction may not be reversible. Treatment with modified \\npreparation of tetrahydrobiopterin has shown good responses \\nin some individuals with PKU.\\nFemales with PKU and their families must be educated on \\nthe risks and prevention of maternal PKU syndrome.

Intellectual disability, psychiatric \\nillness, or both may be present. Major arterial or venous \\nthromboses are a constant threat.\\nConfirmation of the diagnosis requires demonstration of \\nelevated total homocysteine in the blood. A plasma amino \\nacid profile reveals hypermethioninemia. Measurement of \\ncystathionine β-synthase is not clinically available, but numer-\\nous pathogenic variants in the gene are known and can be  \\ntested.\\nThere are two clinical forms of homocystinuria. In one \\nform, activity of the deficient enzyme can be enhanced by \\nthe administration of large doses of pyridoxine (100-500  mg/\\nday). Folate supplementation is added to overcome folate \\ndeficiency if folate is trapped in the process of remethylation \\nof homocysteine to methionine. This pyridoxine-responsive \\nform comprises approximately 50% of cases and is the form \\nmore likely to be missed by neonatal screening because the \\nmethionine concentrations are not always above the screen-\\ning cutoff. The second form is not responsive to pyridoxine \\ntherapy. The use of supplemental betaine (trimethylglycine),  \\na donor of methyl groups for remethylation of homocys -\\nteine to methionine, also has a role in the management of  \\npyridoxine-unresponsive patients. Some cases may benefit \\nfrom B12 and folate supplementation. Consequently, diet and \\nbetaine are sometimes required to control plasma homocysteine, \\neven in pyridoxine-responsive patients. The prognosis is good  \\nfor infants whose plasma homocysteine concentration is \\ncontrolled.\\nMAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE\\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive \\ndisease, also called branched chain ketoaciduria. It is caused \\nby a deficiency of the decarboxylase that initiates the degradation \\nof the ketoacid analogs of the three branched chain amino \\nacids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine (Fig. 53.3). Classic MSUD \\nis rare (1 :  250,000) in t he general population but much more \\ncommon in some population isolates (Pennsylvania Mennonites \\n1 :  150). Th e recommended uniform screening panel (RUSP) \\nincludes MSUD.\\nAlthough MSUD does have intermittent-onset and late-onset \\nforms, clinical manifestations of the classic form typically \\noccur within 1-4 weeks of birth. Poor feeding, vomiting, and \\ntachypnea commonly are noted, but the hallmark of the disease \\nis profound depression of the central nervous system, associated \\nwith alternating hypotonia and hypertonia (extensor spasms), \\nopisthotonos, and seizures. The urine may have the odor of \\nmaple syrup.\\ncognitive impairment and specific defects in executive function. \\nTreatment with a phenylalanine- and tyrosine-restricted diet \\nis effective in preventing these complications.\\nHOMOCYSTINURIA\\nHomocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disease (1  :  200,000 \\nlive births) involving connective tissue, the brain, and the \\nvascular system, is caused by a deficiency of cystathionine \\nβ-synthase. In the normal metabolism of the sulfur amino acids, \\nmethionine gives rise to cystine; homocysteine is a pivotal \\nintermediate (Fig. 53.2). When cystathionine β-synthase is \\ndeficient, homocysteine accumulates in the blood and appears \\nin the urine. Another result is enhanced reconversion of \\nhomocysteine to methionine, resulting in an increase in the \\nconcentration of methionine in the blood. The neonatal screen-\\ning test most commonly used evaluates for elevated methionine. \\nAn excess of homocysteine produces a slowly evolving clinical \\nsyndrome that includes dislocated ocular lenses; long, slender \\nextremities; malar flushing; and livedo reticularis.

Affected females may spontaneously limit their \\nprotein intake.\\nConfirmatory testing for OTC includes a plasma amino \\nacid profile, which may show reduced citrulline and arginine \\nconcentrations with increased glutamate and alanine.

A rapid, more specific test \\ndemonstrates the rapid formation of copious, white precipitate \\nwhen 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is added to the urine sample. \\nThis is because branched-chain ketoacids in urine (but not \\nβ-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate) specifically react with \\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.\\nThe definitive diagnosis of MSUD generally is made by \\nshowing large increases in plasma leucine with less increases \\nin isoleucine, and valine concentrations and identification of \\nexcess alloisoleucine in the plasma. The urinary organic acid \\nprofile is usually abnormal and shows the ketoacid deriva-\\ntives of the branched-chain amino acids. The diagnosis can \\nbe substantiated by detection of pathogenic variants in one of \\nthe three genes BCKDHA, encoding BCKA decarboxylase (E1) \\nalpha subunit (MSUD type 1A); BCKDHB, encoding BCKA \\ndecarboxylase (E1) beta subunit (MSUD type 1B); and DBT, \\nencoding dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) subunit (MSUD type 2)\\nProvision of adequate calories and protein, with restric-\\ntion of leucine, is crucial for acute and chronic management. \\nOrdinary catabolic stresses, such as moderate infections or \\nlabor and delivery in a pregnant mother with MSUD, can \\nprecipitate clinical crises.

Treatment is directed at the specific \\nabnormality, with restriction of precursor substrates and \\nadministration of enzyme cofactors, when available. Outcome \\nis generally poor for children with neonatal-onset propionic \\nor methylmalonic acidemia but is influenced by frequency and \\nseverity of crises and is optimal when diagnosis is made before \\nthe onset of the first episode. Liver transplantation has been \\nused in some patients with early indicators of success. Confirma-\\ntory testing begins with a urine organic acid profile and plasma \\namino acid profile. More specific testing often requires enzyme \\nmeasurements in appropriate tissues. When abnormal results \\nsuggest a specific disorder, DNA testing may identify the \\npathogenic variants involved.\\nPROPIONIC ACIDEMIA AND \\nMETHYLMALONIC ACIDEMIA\\nPropionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia result \\nfrom defects in a series of reactions called the propionate \\npathway (Fig. 54.1). Defects in these steps produce ketosis \\nand hyperglycinemia. Propionic acidemia and methylmalonic \\nacidemia are identified by neonatal screening with tandem \\nmass spectrometry methods. The clinical manifestations \\nof both of these disorders in the neonatal period consist \\nof tachypnea, vomiting, lethargy, coma, intermittent keto-\\nacidosis, hyperglycinemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, \\nhyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia. If these disorders are \\nnot identified by neonatal screening, intermittent episodes \\nof metabolic acidosis occur. Crises occur during periods of \\ncatabolic stress, such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea; they also \\nmay occur without an apparent precipitating event. During \\nperiods of neutropenia, the risk of serious bacterial infection \\nis increased. Failure to thrive and impaired development are  \\ncommon.\\nPropionic acidemia results from deficiency in propionyl \\ncoenzyme A (CoA)-carboxylase, an enzyme that has two \\npairs of identical subunits. All forms of propionic acidemia \\nare inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and are due \\nto pathogenic variants in one of the subunits. Methylma-\\nlonic acidemia results from deficiency in methylmalonyl \\nmutase; this may be caused by pathogenic variants in the \\ngene for the mutase protein itself or in one of the steps of \\nthe synthesis of the cobalamin (B12) cofactors for the \\nenzyme. A complex set of defects in cobalamin metabolism \\nresults in other forms of methylmalonic acidemia, some of \\nwhich are associated with hyperhomocystinemia. Treatment \\nwith large doses of hydroxocobalamin (the active form \\nof vitamin B12) is helpful in some cases of methylmalonic  \\nacidemia.\\nFor propionic acidemia and the vitamin B12–unresponsive \\nforms of methylmalonic acidemia, management includes the \\nrestriction of dietary protein and addition of a medical food \\ndeficient in the specific amino acid precursors of propionyl-\\nCoA (isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine). Carnitine \\nsupplementation is often needed because it is lost in the urine \\nas acylcarnitines. Intestinal bacteria produce a significant \\nquantity of propionate; thus antibacterial treatment to reduce \\nthe population of bacteria in the gut has some beneficial \\neffect in propionic acidemia and vitamin B12–unresponsive \\nmethylmalonic acidemia.\\nASL deficiency is autosomal recessive, and most children \\nin the United States are detected as a result of an elevated \\ncitrulline on newborn screening. The diagnosis is confirmed \\nby the detection of elevated argininosuccinic acid in the urine.\\nTreatment of Hyperammonemia\\nDuring episodes of symptomatic hyperammonemia, protein \\nintake is reduced, and intravenous glucose is given in sufficient \\nquantity to suppress catabolism of endogenous protein. \\nAmmonia can be eliminated by use of the alternate pathway \\nagents, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate, which \\nare excreted in the urine as conjugates of glycine and glutamine. \\nArginine, which is usually deficient, is supplied. When ammonia \\nlevels are very high (>1,000 µM) or refractory to therapy, direct \\nremoval of ammonia using hemodialysis or hemofiltration, but \\nnot peritoneal dialysis, is required. The neurological status must \\nbe followed closely and cerebral edema treated promptly. Despite \\nsuccessful management of hyperammonemic crises, the long-\\nterm outcome for males with severe neonatal OTC deficiency \\nand all children with severe ASL deficiency is guarded. Early \\nliver transplantation has increased survival, especially in males \\nwith severe OTC deficiency.\\nRestriction of dietary protein intake to daily needs is the \\nmainstay of ongoing treatment for urea cycle defects. Crystalline \\nessential amino acids can be supplied in amounts just sufficient \\nto support protein synthesis. Arginine is an essential amino acid \\nwhen arginine synthesis via the urea cycle is grossly impaired; \\nthus arginine or citrulline must be supplied except in the case \\nof arginase deficiency. Ongoing maintenance treatment with \\nphenylbutyrate (which is metabolized to phenylacetate) prevents \\naccumulation of ammonia.\\nDISORDERS OF AMINO ACID TRANSPORT \\nTHAT AFFECT SPECIFIC TRANSPORT \\nMECHANISMS IN THE KIDNEY  \\nAND INTESTINE\\nCystinuria is a disorder of renal tubular transport of cystine, \\nlysine, arginine, and ornithine. Although intestinal transport is \\naffected in some genetic forms, the symptoms are largely due to \\nthe renal transport abnormality. The concentration of cystine \\nexceeds its solubility product and results in significant renal \\nstones. Evaluation and diagnosis are based on the pattern of \\namino acid excretion in the urine. DNA testing is likely to be \\ninformative. Treatment is based on increasing the solubility of \\ncystine by complexing it with compounds such as penicillamine.\\nIntestinal transport of tryptophan is impaired in Hartnup \\nsyndrome; pellagra-like symptoms result from this deficiency. \\nDiagnosis is based on the amino acid pattern in urine. Treatment \\nwith tryptophan improves outcomes.\\nCHAPTER 54 \\nOrganic Acid Disorders\\nDISORDERS OF ORGANIC ACID METABOLISM\\nOrganic acid disorders result from a block in the pathways of \\namino acid catabolism.

Despite this treatment, as \\nmany as one third of children still develop neurological \\nsymptoms.\\nBIOTINIDASE DEFICIENCY AND \\nHOLOCARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY\\nBiotin is a ubiquitous vitamin that is covalently linked to \\nmany carboxylases and cannot be recycled from its attach -\\nment to the carboxylases. Thus inherited biotinidase deficiency \\ngreatly increases the dietary requirement for biotin. Affected \\nindividuals become biotin deficient while consuming normal \\ndiets. Clinical disease can appear in the neonatal period or \\nbe delayed until later infancy, depending on the degree of  \\ndeficiency.\\nClinical manifestations of biotin deficiency vary greatly \\n(seizures, hypotonia, sensory neural deafness, alopecia, skin \\nrash, metabolic acidosis, immune deficits) and depend on \\nwhich enzymes in which tissues have the most biotin deple-\\ntion. Carboxylation is a crucial reaction in the metabolism \\nof organic acids; most patients with biotinidase deficiency \\nexcrete abnormal amounts of several organic acids, among \\nwhich β-methylcrotonylglycine is prominent. In addition to \\nbiotinidase deficiency, an inherited deficiency of holocarboxylase \\nsynthetase gives rise to severe disease and to similar patterns \\nof organic aciduria. Both conditions respond well to treatment \\nwith large doses of biotin (5–20 m g/day). Confirmatory testing \\nis accomplished with quantitative measurement of biotinidase \\nactivity.\\nISOVALERIC ACIDEMIA\\nIsovaleric acidemia results from a block in the catabolism of \\nleucine. Its clinical manifestations are similar to those of defects \\nin the propionate pathway. The strong odor of isovaleric acid \\nresults in sweaty feet odor in untreated infants. Therapy involves \\nrestricting the intake of leucine and providing glycine as an \\nalternate pathway therapy that conjugates isovaleric acid (Fig. \\n54.2) and is then excreted in the urine.\\nGLUTARIC ACIDEMIA I\\nGlutaric acidemia I results from a deficiency at the end of the \\nlysine catabolic pathway. It is an autosomal recessive disease \\nproduced by deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity \\n(Fig. 54.3).

Some patients respond to administration of \\nriboflavin. Glutaric aciduria type II exhibits autosomal recessive \\ninheritance. Clinical testing will typically include abnormal \\norganic acid and acylcarnitine profiles. The diagnosis may be \\nsuggested by abnormal fatty acid oxidation studies. It is typically \\nconfirmed through DNA testing.\\nCARNITINE DEFICIENCY\\nCarnitine is a crucial cofactor in the transport of long-chain \\nfatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane (see Fig. \\n55.1). It is synthesized from lysine by humans and is present \\nin dietary red meat and dairy products. Carnitine deficiency \\nis either primary (caused by failure of intake, synthesis, or \\ntransport of carnitine) or secondary (caused by the excretion \\nof excessive amounts of carnitine as carnityl esters in patients \\nwith other inborn errors of metabolism; treatment with drugs \\nthat complex carnitine, such as valproic acid; or as a result of \\nrenal replacement therapy). Primary systemic carnitine defi-\\nciency is rare and results from inadequate renal reabsorption \\nof carnitine secondary to pathogenic variants in the sodium-\\ndependent carnitine transporter. It responds well to carnitine \\nsupplementation. There are numerous examples of secondary \\ncarnitine deficiency among the organic acidurias, most promi-\\nnently in disorders of the propionate pathway and in disorders \\nof the β-oxidation of long-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. \\nClinical manifestations of carnitine deficiency include hypo -\\nketotic hypoglycemia, lethargy, lassitude, muscle weakness, \\nsudden death, and cardiomyopathy.\\nCHAPTER 56 \\nLysosomal and Peroxisomal \\nDisorders\\nPEROXISOMAL DISORDERS\\nPeroxisomes are subcellular organelles involved in metabolism \\nand biosynthesis of bile acids, membrane phospholipids, and \\nsome β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Disorders include \\nconditions caused by abnormal peroxisomal enzyme function \\nand abnormal peroxisomal biogenesis. Clinical symptoms are \\ndiverse and frequently include developmental delay  and \\ndysmorphic features that can involve the skeleton and the \\nhead. Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, \\nand infantile Refsum disease are examples of disorders of \\nperoxisome biogenesis. Zellweger syndrome, an autosomal \\nrecessive disease (1 :  100,000 b irths), is also called cerebrohepa-\\ntorenal syndrome. Peroxisomes are virtually absent, as are normal \\nperoxisomal functions, which include the oxidation of very-\\nlong-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Affected infants have high \\nforeheads, flat orbital ridges, widely open fontanelles, hepato-\\nmegaly, and hypotonia. Other anomalies are common. Failure \\nmanifestation, as is a Reye syndrome–like illness with \\nhypoglycemia and elevated liver enzymes. Fatty infiltration \\nof the liver also occurs. True hepatic failure is rare. Episodes \\nmay be recurrent in the patient or the family. Sudden infant \\ndeath syndrome is reported in infants with MCAD deficiency, \\nperhaps related to hypoglycemia. Treatment requires avoidance \\nof fasting and provision of calories with fever or other metabolic \\nstress. In a vomiting infant or child, this frequently requires \\nparenteral (intravenous) provision of dextrose.\\nVLCAD deficiency and LCHAD (trifunctional protein) \\ndeficiency result in significant myopathy and cardiomyopathy. \\nThis cardiomyopathy may be rapidly reversed with appropri-\\nate dietary treatment. LCHAD deficiency is accompanied \\nby a retinopathy in later childhood. In all of the disorders \\nof β-oxidation, carnitine depletion can occur through exces -\\nsive urinary excretion of carnitine esters of the incompletely \\noxidized fatty acids. Measurement of plasma carnitine is \\nhelpful in monitoring for this deficiency, which results in \\nweakness and muscle pain, along with myoglobinuria in some  \\npeople.\\nHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency, although not \\na disorder of β-oxidation, interferes profoundly with hepatic \\nadaptation to fasting by impairing ketogenesis (see Fig. 55.1). \\nThe clinical manifestations are those of MCAD deficiency, except \\nthat carnitine depletion is less prominent.\\nThe diagnosis of disorders involving a deficiency of \\nβ-oxidation is suggested by the clinical picture and by hypo-\\nketotic hypoglycemia. The diagnosis is suggested by abnormal \\nurinary organic acid and acylglycine profiles, along with plasma \\nacylcarnitine and free fatty acid profiles. Enzyme measurements \\nand/or DNA testing are required to confirm the diagnosis. The \\nprofile of acylcarnitines in cultured skin fibroblasts may be \\nhelpful if other testing is not conclusive. In MCAD deficiency a \\nsingle pathogenic variant c.985 A→G accounts for a significant \\npercentage of cases, especially among children of Northern \\nEuropean ancestry. Treatment includes avoidance of fasting, \\nas well as fluid and calorie supplementation during periods of \\nmetabolic stress, such as fever. In MCAD deficiency, medium-\\nchain triglycerides must be avoided. In the long-chain fatty acid \\nmetabolic disorders, provision of medium-chain fatty acids \\nimproves muscle energy metabolism.\\nGLUTARIC ACIDURIA TYPE II\\nGlutaric aciduria type II (multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase \\ndeficiency) is a clinical disease produced by a defect in the \\ntransfer of electrons from flavine adenine nucleotides to the \\nelectron transport chain (electron transfer flavoprotein [ETF], \\nor ETF dehydrogenase); this defect results in a deficiency of \\nmultiple fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (see Fig. 55.1). It should \\nnot be confused with glutaric acidemia type I (see Chapter 54). \\nWhen the enzyme essentially is nonfunctional, congenital \\nanomalies are common, including renal cysts, facial abnormali-\\nties, rocker-bottom feet, and hypospadias. Severely affected \\ninfants have nonketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and \\nthe odor of sweaty feet soon after birth; these infants may die \\nwithin the neonatal period. Less severely affected infants may \\nhave a more episodic, Reye syndrome–like illness. Skeletal and \\ncardiac myopathy can be prominent in this complex, multi-\\nsystemic disease.

However, this testing has a significant false-positive \\nrate. Diagnostic testing includes measurement of glycosami-\\nnoglycans in urine and specific assays for lysosomal enzyme \\nactivity in white blood cells. If the urine test is positive, it helps \\ndirect specific enzyme measurement. If it is negative, it does \\nnot exclude a lysosomal storage disorder, and other testing \\nmodalities are needed if clinical signs are convincing. In dis-\\norders in which specific pathogenic variants are known, \\nmolecular testing refines the diagnosis and is an important \\nway to resolve disease status in infants with a positive newborn \\nscreen. Specific diagnosis, carrier testing, and evaluation of \\nat-risk family members often require a multipronged approach \\nto testing. Making a specific diagnosis is assuming increasing \\nimportance because specific treatment for some lysosomal \\ndisorders is most effective when started early in the disease \\ncourse.\\nTREATMENT STRATEGIES\\nSpecific treatment directed at the metabolic abnormality is \\navailable for some lysosomal disorders. In specific disorders \\n(e.g., Gaucher disease), oral medication may be successful in \\nreducing the accumulation of the metabolite that cannot be \\ncatabolized. For some disorders, bone marrow (stem cell) \\ntransplantation is the most efficacious mechanism to restore \\nlysosomal function. For others, replacement of the missing \\nhydrolytic enzyme by systemic administration of the enzyme \\nallows degradation of stored material. The disorders caused by \\ndeficient α-L-iduronidase (MPS1, Hurler syndrome, Scheie \\nsyndrome, and their variants) respond to treatment with \\nintravenous human recombinant α-L-iduronidase (laronidase). \\nOther disorders for which enzyme therapy is available include \\nMPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), Gaucher disease, Fabry \\ndisease, and MPS II (Hunter syndrome). Stem cell transplanta-\\ntion or ex vivo gene therapy has been helpful or are under \\ninvestigation in the following disorders: MPS type IH (Hurler \\nsyndrome), MPS type VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), MPS \\ntype VII (Sly syndrome), metachromatic leukodystrophy, \\nalpha-fucosidosis, alpha-mannosidosis, Gaucher disease, and \\nNiemann-Pick disease type B. A discussion of appropriate target \\ntherapeutic strategies should be held with patients and their \\nrelevant caregivers by an expert in the specific disorder. Nonethe-\\nless, treatment for many of these conditions is supportive, with \\ncareful attention to respiratory status and physical therapy. As \\na result of the rapidly changing diagnostic and therapeutic \\noptions, providers with a special interest in these disorders \\nshould be consulted when a diagnosis is suspected. Treatment \\ndecisions should be made by the family in the light of the \\npotential therapeutic benefits and burdens of therapy and \\ntypically should be resolved before the onset of central nervous \\nsystem manifestations, which are typically not improved by \\nthese approaches.\\nto thrive, seizures, and nystagmus develop early, and death \\noccurs within the first year. Refsum disease, neonatal adreno-\\nleukodystrophy, and malonic aciduria are examples of peroxi-\\nsomal single-enzyme disorders. Diagnostic testing includes \\nmeasurement of VLCFAs in plasma and pipecolic acid in urine. \\nSpecific molecular testing, particularly for the disorders involving \\none in the series of PEX genes, is available for some disorders. \\nMost of these conditions are untreatable; however, bone marrow \\ntransplant can be helpful in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy \\n(X-ALD) before the onset of severe symptoms.\\nX-ALD has been added to the recommended uniform \\nscreening panel (RUSP). This disorder, which affects 1 :  20,000 \\nmales, is caused by a defect in a peroxisomal membrane \\nprotein. There are three main phenotypes seen in males with \\npathogenic variants in this gene: Childhood onset cerebral \\nform, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and “ Addison disease. ” \\nApproximately 20% of carrier females will develop a milder \\nform of the AMN phenotype. The phenotype of affected males \\ncannot be predicted by analyte (VLCFA) levels or by genotype. \\nThe childhood cerebral form is a severe progressive disease that \\ntypically presents with inattentive symptoms and can progress \\nto total disability within 6 months. Hematopoietic stem cell \\ntransplantation (HSCT) should be considered for boys in the \\nearly stages of the cerebral form who have evidence of brain \\ninvolvement on MRI. Because of the significant risks, HSCT is \\nrecommended for individuals with evidence of brain involvement \\nby MRI and minimal neuropsychological findings (performance \\nIQ >80) with a normal clinical neurological examination. Cor-\\nticosteroid replacement therapy can be lifesaving in individuals \\nwith AMN or Addison only presentation. The most sensitive \\nindicators of adrenal dysfunction are elevated plasma ACTH \\nand impaired cortisol response to ACTH challenge.\\nLYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS\\nLysosomes are subcellular organelles that contain degradative \\nenzymes for complex glycosaminoglycans, also called muco-\\npolysaccharides. Glycosaminoglycans are macromolecules that \\nplay a number of roles within cells. Genetic disorders result \\nfrom abnormal formation of the lysosome itself or from \\ndeficiency in specific hydrolytic enzymes, in the mechanisms \\nthat protect intralysosomal enzymes from hydrolytic destruction, \\nor in the transport of materials into the lysosome and of \\nmetabolites out of the lysosome. These materials are stored in \\ncells and ultimately result in their destruction, especially in \\nthe nervous system. The clinical disorders are diverse, reflecting \\ntissue specificity of lysosomal function and the intrinsic turnover \\nrates of the compounds whose cycling is affected (Table 56.1). \\nSome disorders are apparent only during adult life. Storage in \\nsolid organs results in hepatosplenomegaly. Some disorders \\naffect many tissues but spare the brain, with some having almost \\nexclusive involvement of the musculoskeletal system.

They perform a variety of functions such \\nas intracellular signaling of oxygen tension and key roles in \\nprogrammed cell death. From a biochemical perspective, \\nmitochondria are the key site of energy production in the cell. \\nIndeed they are the site of β-oxidation (see Chapter 55), the \\nKrebs cycle, and parts of the urea cycle (see Fig. 53.4). This \\ncomplexity requires more than 1,000 proteins localized specifi-\\ncally to the mitochondrion. Only 13 of these are encoded by \\nthe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); the remainder are nuclear \\nencoded (on the chromosomes) and require import into the \\nmitochondrion. In addition, the mtDNA needs its own set of \\nproteins to allow for its maintenance, transcription, and \\ntranslation.\\nMitochondrial disorders are typically defined as defects in \\nthe ability to generate energy from oxidative phosphorylation to \\nA\\nB\\n4000200016000\\n10000 8000 OLR\\n6000\\nYCNA\\nW\\nND2\\nND1 I\\nM\\nQ\\nL16S12SCR\\nHSP\\nOHR\\nMammalian cell\\nOuter\\nmembrane\\nInner\\nmembrane\\nMatrix\\nMitochondrion\\nVFTCytB\\nND6\\nND5\\nND4/4L ND3C OX3 ATP6/8 COX2\\nCyt c\\nUQ\\nComplex I\\nH+ H+ H+\\nComplex III\\nH+ H+ H+\\nComplex IV\\nH+ H+ H+\\nComplex V\\nH+ H+ H+\\nH+H+H+H+\\nNAD+NADH\\nADP + Pi\\n1/2 O2 H2O\\nATP\\nComplex II\\nSuccinate Fumarate\\nCOX1\\nProtein-coding gene (13 total)\\ntRNA gene (22 total)\\nRG KD\\nS\\nHSL\\n14000\\n12000\\n~17000/0 bpPE\\nFIGURE 57.1 The mammalian mitochondrial genome and its protein-coding gene repertoire involved \\nin the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.

These disorders comprise forms of primary \\nlactic acidosis. They frequently present as intractable, lethal \\nacidosis in the first days or weeks of life and are difficult to \\ntreat. Some of the enzymes in this pathway can be measured \\nand specific diagnosis can be made. This may require white \\nblood cells or tissue biopsy.\\nGENETICS OF MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS\\nMitochondrial function is carried out by proteins that are coded \\nfor by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. These enzymes \\nare extremely complicated, and several are quite large. The \\nmitochondrial genome encodes 13 subunits of the enzymes \\ninvolved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. More \\nthan 85 autosomal genes code for the rest of the subunits of \\nthese enzymes. In children, only about 15% of cases of mito-\\nchondrial disease are caused by pathogenic variants in mtDNA; \\nthe rest are due to pathogenic variants in nuclear genes. The \\nmost frequent cases in several large series have been pathogenic \\nvariants that lead to a reduction in the ability of the mtDNA \\nto maintain itself. Large population studies show carrier rates \\nof about 2% of the population for pathogenic variants in \\npolymerase (DNA directed), gamma (POLG), and deoxyguano-\\nsine kinase (DGUOK). Most disorders show autosomal recessive \\ninheritance. A few are X-linked or caused by pathogenic variants \\nin the mtDNA inherited from the mother, such as mitochondrial \\nencephalopathy with lactic acidosis (MELAS) and mitochondrial \\nencephalopathy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), or deletions \\nsuch as maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD).\\nTREATMENT OF MITOCHONDRIAL \\nDISORDERS\\nRepairing the basic energy deficit and getting the appropriate \\ndrugs and cofactors to the appropriate location within the \\nmitochondrion are difficult. Nevertheless, a number of strategies \\nare used, including judicious physical therapy and exercise with \\nadequate rest, adequate nutrition, and cofactors for the deficient \\npathway. Specific treatment is limited for most mitochondrial \\ndefects. Vitamin cofactors for the respiratory chain, such as \\nriboflavin and pharmaceutical forms of coenzyme Q, are often \\nused. When a single organ bears most of the damage, organ \\ntransplant may be effective.

Given the complexity of the respiratory chain, \\nit is not surprising that the described defects are varied as to \\ncause, intensity, and tissues affected. The metabolism of glucose \\nto carbon dioxide and water, with pyruvate as an intermediate \\n(Fig. 57.2), occurs as part of the energy cycle in many tissues. \\nInterference with mitochondrial oxidative metabolism may \\nresult in the accumulation of pyruvate. Because lactate dehy-\\ndrogenase is ubiquitous, and because the equilibrium catalyzed \\nby this enzyme greatly favors lactate over pyruvate, the accumula-\\ntion of pyruvate results in lactic acidosis. The most common \\ncause of such lactic acidosis is end-organ oxygen deficiency \\ncaused by hypoxia or poor perfusion. Lactic acidosis also occurs \\nwhen specific reactions of pyruvate are impaired. In the liver, \\npyruvate undergoes carboxylation to form oxaloacetate using \\nthe enzyme pyruvate carboxylase; deficiency in this enzyme \\ncauses severe lactic acidosis. In many tissues, lactate is catabo-\\nlized to form acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) by the pyruvate \\ndehydrogenase complex; deficiency in pyruvate dehydrogenase \\nalso can cause lactic acidosis.

This is typically \\nat times of catabolism such as during intercurrent illness \\nor prolonged starvation.\\n• T esting for urea cycle defects, intermittent maple syrup urine \\ndisease (MSUD), or fatty acid oxidation defects may be \\nnormal in affected children if the child is not under significant \\ncatabolic stress.\\n• R espiratory alkalosis is frequently seen in the early stages \\nof a hyperammonemic crisis, but this may give way to \\nrespiratory failure as the ammonia level increases.\\n• G eneral clinical laboratory testing can define the metabolic \\nderangement and refine the differential diagnosis in a child \\nsuspected to have an inborn error of metabolism.\\n• I n the United States the majority of infants diagnosed with \\na treatable metabolic disorder will be identified as a result \\nof an abnormal newborn screen.\\n• Th e “recommended uniform screening panel” (RUSP) is \\ndefined by the Federal Advisory Committee on Heritable \\nDisorders in the Newborn and Child (ACHDNC). In order \\nto be added to the RUSP , conditions must have a proven \\nbenefit of identification through newborn screening in terms \\nof reducing mortality or improving long-term neurocognitive \\noutcomes.\\n• F or many disorders the success of newborn screening is \\ndependent on the blood sample being drawn at the correct \\ntime and analyzed in a timely fashion.\\n• F or the newborn screening system to protect babies it must \\ninclude prompt return of results to families and mechanisms \\nfor rapid institution of therapy.\\n• N ewborn screening tests have a wide range of specificity, \\nwith some tests having close to 90% false positive rate. \\nTherefore it is essential to perform appropriate confirmatory \\ntesting.\\n• Th erapy for metabolic disease may focus on reducing the \\nintake of specific substances that lead to buildup of toxic \\ncompounds for example restricting protein intake to prevent \\nphenylalanine buildup in phenylketonuria (PKU). In addition, \\nspecific medications may prevent the buildup of toxic \\nsubstances (e.g., miglustat in Gaucher disease). Therapy may \\nprovide supraphysiological cofactors that enhance residual \\nenzymatic function for example tetrahydrobiopterin in PKU.\\n• I n most metabolic disorders caused by the accumulation of \\ntoxic small molecules, catabolism increases the rate of \\nproduction of these toxic metabolites. Consequently adequate \\nand, at times, supraphysiological provision of sources of \\nenergy (e.g., parenteral dextrose) is used to drive the patient \\nto an anabolic state where less of this compound can be \\nproduced.\\n• I n many metabolic disorders, compounds that would oth -\\nerwise be nonessential need to be provided (e.g., tyrosine \\nin PKU).\\n• I n specific metabolic disorders the primary pathology is \\ndriven by a deficiency of essential compounds (e.g., the \\ninability to undergo glyconeogenesis leads to fasting \\nhypoglycemia).

Gowen Jr.\\nCHAPTER 58 \\nAssessment of the Mother, \\nFetus, and Newborn\\nASSESSMENT OF THE MOTHER\\nPregnancies associated with perinatal morbidity or mortality \\nare considered high risk. Identification of high-risk pregnancies \\nis essential to the care of the infant because they may result in \\nintrauterine fetal death, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), \\ncongenital anomalies, excessive fetal growth, birth asphyxia \\nand trauma, prematurity (birth at <38 weeks) or postmaturity \\n(birth at ≥42 weeks), neonatal disease, or long-term risks of \\ncerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and chronic sequelae of \\nneonatal intensive care. Ten percent to 20% of women may be \\nhigh risk at some time during their pregnancy. Although some \\nobstetric complications are first seen during labor and delivery \\nand cannot be predicted, more than 50% of perinatal mortality \\nand morbidity results from problems identified before delivery \\nas high risk. After a high-risk pregnancy is identified, measures \\ncan be instituted to prevent complications, provide intensive \\nfetal surveillance, and initiate appropriate treatments of the \\nmother and fetus.\\nA history of previous premature birth, intrauterine fetal \\ndeath, multiple gestation, IUGR, congenital malformation, \\nexplained or unexplained neonatal death (e.g., group B \\nstreptococcal sepsis), birth trauma, preeclampsia, gestational \\ndiabetes, grand multipara status (five or more pregnancies), or \\ncesarean section is associated with additional risk in subsequent  \\npregnancies.\\nPregnancy complications that increase the risk of a poor \\noutcome can be secondary to maternal or fetal causes or both. \\nComplications include placenta previa; abruptio placentae; \\npreeclampsia; diabetes; oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; \\nmultiple gestation; blood group sensitization; abnormal \\nlevels of unconjugated estriols, chorionic gonadotropin, or \\nalpha-fetoprotein; abnormal fetal ultrasound; hydrops fetalis; \\nmaternal trauma or surgery; abnormal fetal presentation \\n(breech); exposure to prescribed or illicit drugs; prolonged \\nlabor; cephalopelvic disproportion; prolapsed cord; fetal distress; \\nprolonged or premature rupture of membranes; short cervical \\nlength (<25 mm) and the presence of fetal fibronectin in cervi-\\ncal secretions at less than 35 weeks’ gestation (a predictor of \\npreterm labor); cervical infections and vaginosis; and congenital \\ninfections, including rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, \\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), toxoplasmosis, syphilis, \\nand gonorrhea.\\nMaternal medical complications associated with increased \\nrisk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality include \\ndiabetes, chronic hypertension, congenital heart disease (espe-\\ncially with right-to-left shunting and Eisenmenger complex), \\nglomerulonephritis, collagen vascular disease (especially \\nsystemic lupus erythematosus with or without antiphospholipid \\nantibodies), lung disease (cystic fibrosis), severe anemia (sickle \\ncell anemia), hyperthyroidism, myasthenia gravis, idiopathic \\nthrombocytopenic purpura, inborn errors of metabolism \\n(maternal phenylketonuria), and malignancy.\\nObstetric complications often are associated with increased \\nfetal or neonatal risk. Vaginal bleeding in the first trimester \\nor early second trimester may be caused by a threatened or \\nactual spontaneous abortion and is associated with increased \\nrisk of congenital malformations or chromosomal disorders. \\nPainless vaginal bleeding that is not associated with labor and \\noccurs in the late second or (more likely) third trimester often \\nis the result of placenta previa. Bleeding develops when the \\nplacental mass overlies the internal cervical os; this may produce \\nmaternal hemorrhagic shock, necessitating transfusions. Bleeding \\nalso may result in premature delivery. Painful vaginal bleeding \\nis often the result of retroplacental hemorrhage or placental \\nabruption. Associated findings may be advanced maternal age \\nand parity, maternal chronic hypertension, maternal cocaine use, \\npreterm rupture of membranes, polyhydramnios, twin gestation, \\nand preeclampsia. Fetal asphyxia ensues as the retroplacental \\nhematoma causes placental separation that interferes with \\nfetal oxygenation. Both types of bleeding are associated with \\nfetal blood loss. Neonatal anemia may be more common with \\nplacenta previa.\\nAbnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid, resulting \\nin oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, are associated with \\nincreased fetal and neonatal risk. Oligohydramnios (amniotic \\nultrasound fluid index ≤2 cm) is associated with IUGR and \\nmajor congenital anomalies, particularly of the fetal kidneys, and \\nwith chromosomal syndromes. Bilateral renal agenesis results in \\ndiminished production of amniotic fluid and a specific deforma-\\ntion syndrome (Potter syndrome), which includes clubfeet, \\ncharacteristic compressed facies, low-set ears, scaphoid abdomen, \\nand diminished chest wall size accompanied by pulmonary \\nhypoplasia and, often, pneumothorax. Uterine compression in \\nthe absence of amniotic fluid retards lung growth, and patients \\nwith this condition die of respiratory failure rather than renal \\ninsufficiency. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (donor) and \\ncomplications from amniotic fluid leakage also are associated \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Ultrasonography in the second tri -\\nmester reveals discordant amniotic fluid volume with oliguria/\\noligohydramnios and hypervolemia/polyuria/polyhydramnios \\nwith a distended bladder, with or without hydrops and heart \\nfailure. Treatment includes attempts to ablate the arteriovenous \\nconnection (using a laser). The birth order of twins also affects \\nmorbidity by increasing the risk of the second-born twin for \\nbreech position, birth asphyxia, birth trauma, and respiratory \\ndistress syndrome.\\nOverall, twinning is observed in 1 of 80 pregnancies; 80% \\nof all twin gestations are dizygotic twins. The diagnosis of the \\ntype of twins can be determined by placentation, sex, fetal \\nmembrane structure, and, if necessary, tissue and blood group \\ntyping or DNA analysis.\\nToxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia/eclampsia, is a \\ndisorder of unknown but probably vascular etiology that may \\nlead to maternal hypertension, uteroplacental insufficiency, \\nIUGR, intrauterine asphyxia, maternal seizures, and maternal \\ndeath. Toxemia is more common in nulliparous women and in \\nwomen with twin gestation, chronic hypertension, obesity, renal \\ndisease, positive family history of toxemia, or diabetes mellitus. \\nA subcategory of preeclampsia, the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, \\nelevated liver enzyme levels, low platelets), is more severe and is \\noften associated with a fetal inborn error of fatty acid oxidation \\n(long-chain hydroxyacyl–coenzyme A dehydrogenase of the \\ntrifunctional protein complex).\\nFETUS AND NEWBORN\\nThe late fetal–early neonatal period has the highest mortality \\nrate of any age interval. Perinatal mortality refers to fetal \\ndeaths occurring from the 20th week of gestation until the \\n28th day after birth and is expressed as number of deaths per \\n1,000 live births. Intrauterine fetal death accounts for 40-50% of \\nthe perinatal mortality rate. Such infants, defined as stillborn, \\nare born without a heart rate and are apneic, limp, pale, and \\ncyanotic. Many stillborn infants exhibit evidence of macera-\\ntion; pale, peeling skin; corneal opacification; and soft cranial  \\ncontents.\\nMortality rates around the time of birth are expressed as \\nnumber of deaths per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality \\nrate includes all infants dying during the period from after \\nbirth to the first 28 days of life. Modern neonatal intensive care \\nallows many newborns with life-threatening diseases to survive \\nthe neonatal period, only to die of their original diseases or \\nof complications of therapy after 28 days of life. This delayed \\nmortality and mortality caused by acquired illnesses occur \\nduring the postneonatal period, which begins after 28 days \\nof life and extends to the end of the first year of life.\\nThe infant mortality rate  encompasses the neonatal and \\nthe postneonatal periods. In the United States, it declined to \\n5.8 :  1,000 in 2015. Th e rate for African American infants was \\napproximately 11.0 :  1,000. Th e most common causes of perinatal \\nand neonatal death are listed in Table 58.1. Overall, congenital \\nanomalies and diseases of the premature infant are the most \\nsignificant causes of neonatal mortality.\\nLow birth weight (LBW) infants, defined as infants having \\nbirth weights of less than 2,500 g , represent a disproportionately \\nlarge component of the neonatal and infant mortality rates. \\nAlthough LBW infants make up only about 6-7% of all births, \\nthey account for more than 70% of neonatal deaths. IUGR is the \\nwith oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios increases the risk of \\nfetal distress during labor (meconium-stained fluid and variable \\ndecelerations); the risk may be reduced by saline amnioinfusion \\nduring labor.\\nPolyhydramnios may be acute and associated with premature \\nlabor, maternal discomfort, and respiratory compromise. More \\noften, polyhydramnios is chronic and is associated with diabetes, \\nimmune or nonimmune hydrops fetalis, multiple gestation, \\ntrisomy 18 or 21, and major congenital anomalies. Anencephaly, \\nhydrocephaly, and meningomyelocele are associated with \\nreduced fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid. Esophageal and \\nduodenal atresia as well as cleft palate interfere with swallow-\\ning and gastrointestinal fluid dynamics. Additional causes of \\npolyhydramnios include Werdnig-Hoffmann and Beckwith-\\nWiedemann syndromes, conjoined twins, chylothorax, cystic \\nadenomatoid lung malformation, diaphragmatic hernia, \\ngastroschisis, sacral teratoma, placental chorioangioma, and \\nmyotonic dystrophy. Hydrops fetalis may be a result of Rh \\nor other blood group incompatibilities and anemia caused \\nby intrauterine hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes by maternal \\nIgG-sensitized antibodies crossing the placenta. Hydrops is \\ncharacterized by fetal edema, ascites, hypoalbuminemia, and \\ncongestive heart failure. Causes of nonimmune hydrops include \\nfetal arrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardia, congenital heart \\nblock), fetal anemia (bone marrow suppression, nonimmune \\nhemolysis, or twin-to-twin transfusion), severe congenital \\nmalformation, intrauterine infections, congenital neuroblastoma, \\ninborn errors of metabolism (storage diseases), fetal hepatitis, \\nnephrotic syndrome, and pulmonary lymphangiectasia. Twin-\\nto-twin transfusion syndrome (recipient) also may be associated \\nwith polyhydramnios. Polyhydramnios is often the result of \\nunknown causes. If severe, polyhydramnios may be managed \\nwith bed rest, indomethacin, or serial amniocenteses.\\nPremature rupture of the membranes, which occurs in the \\nabsence of labor, and prolonged rupture of the membranes (>24 \\nhours) are associated with an increased risk of maternal or fetal \\ninfection (chorioamnionitis) and preterm birth. In the immediate \\nnewborn period, group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli are \\nthe two most common pathogens associated with sepsis. Listeria \\nmonocytogenes is a less common cause. Mycoplasma hominis, \\nUreaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobic \\nbacteria of the vaginal flora also have been implicated in infec-\\ntion of the amniotic fluid. Infection with community-acquired \\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus must be considered \\nfor infants with skin infections or with known exposures. The \\nrisk of serious fetal infection increases as the duration between \\nrupture and labor (latent period) increases, especially if the \\nperiod is greater than 24 hours. Intrapartum antibiotic therapy \\ndecreases the risk of neonatal sepsis.\\nMultiple gestations are associated with increased risk result-\\ning from polyhydramnios, premature birth, IUGR, abnormal \\npresentation (breech), congenital anomalies (intestinal atresia, \\nporencephaly, and single umbilical artery), intrauterine fetal \\ndemise, birth asphyxia, and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. \\nTwin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is associated with a high \\nmortality and is seen only in monozygotic twins who share \\na common placenta and have an arteriovenous connection \\nbetween their circulations. The fetus on the arterial side of \\nthe shunt serves as the blood donor, resulting in fetal anemia, \\ngrowth retardation, and oligohydramnios for this fetus. The \\nrecipient, or venous-side twin, is larger or discordant in size, \\nis plethoric and polycythemic, and may show polyhydramnios. \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The neonatal and infant mortality rates \\nare nearly twofold higher among African American infants. \\nThese racial differences are only partly explained by poverty.\\nASSESSMENT OF THE FETUS\\nFetal size can be determined accurately by ultrasound tech-\\nniques. Fetal growth can be assessed by determining the fundal \\nheight of the uterus through bimanual examination of the gravid \\nabdomen. Ultrasound measurements of the fetal biparietal \\ndiameter, femur length, and abdominal circumference are used \\nto estimate fetal growth. A combination of these measurements \\npredicts fetal weight. Deviations from the normal fetal growth \\ncurve are associated with high-risk conditions.\\nIUGR is present when fetal growth stops and, over time, \\ndeclines to less than the 5th percentile of growth for gestational \\nage or when growth proceeds slowly, but absolute size remains \\nless than the 5th percentile. Growth restriction may result from \\nfetal conditions that reduce the innate growth potential, such as \\nfetal rubella infection, primordial dwarfing syndromes, chromo-\\nsomal abnormalities, and congenital malformation syndromes. \\nReduced fetal production of insulin and insulin-like growth \\nfactor I is associated with fetal growth restriction. Placental \\ncauses of IUGR include villitis (congenital infections), placental \\ntumors, chronic abruptio placentae, twin-to-twin transfusion \\nsyndrome, and placental insufficiency. Maternal causes include \\nsevere peripheral vascular diseases that reduce uterine blood flow \\n(chronic hypertension, diabetic vasculopathy, and preeclampsia/\\neclampsia), reduced nutritional intake, alcohol or drug abuse, \\ncigarette smoking, and uterine constraint (noted predominantly \\nin mothers of small stature with a low prepregnancy weight) and \\nreduced weight gain during pregnancy. The outcome of IUGR \\ndepends on the cause of the reduced fetal growth and the associ-\\nated complications after birth (Table 58.2). Fetuses subjected \\nto chronic intrauterine hypoxia as a result of uteroplacental \\ninsufficiency are at an increased risk for the comorbidities of \\nbirth asphyxia, polycythemia, and hypoglycemia. Fetuses with \\nreduced tissue mass due to chromosomal, metabolic, or multiple \\ncongenital anomaly syndromes have poor outcomes based on \\nthe prognosis for the particular syndrome. Fetuses born to \\nsmall mothers and fetuses of mothers with poor nutritional \\nintake usually show catch-up growth after birth.\\nFetal size does not always correlate with functional or \\nstructural maturity. Determining fetal maturity is crucial when \\nmaking a decision to deliver a fetus because of fetal or maternal \\ndisease. Fetal gestational age may be determined accurately on \\nthe basis of a correct estimate of the last menstrual period. \\nClinically relevant landmark dates can be used to determine \\ngestational age; the first audible heart tones by fetoscope are \\ndetected at 18-20 weeks (12-14 weeks by Doppler methods), \\nand quickening of fetal movements usually is perceived at 18-20 \\nweeks. However, it is not always possible to determine fetal \\nmaturity by such dating, especially in a high-risk situation, \\nsuch as preterm labor or a diabetic pregnancy.\\nSurfactant, a combination of surface-active phospholipids \\nand proteins, is produced by the maturing fetal lung and \\neventually is secreted into the amniotic fluid. The amount of \\nsurfactant in amniotic fluid is a direct reflection of surface-\\nactive material in the fetal lung and can be used to predict \\nthe presence or absence of pulmonary maturity. Because \\nphosphatidylcholine, or lecithin, is a principal component of \\nmost common cause of LBW in developing countries, whereas \\nprematurity is the cause in developed countries.\\nVery low birth weight (VLBW) infants, weighing less than \\n1,500 g a t birth, represent about 1% of all births but account \\nfor 50% of neonatal deaths. Compared with infants weighing \\n2,500 g o r more, LBW infants are 40 times more likely to die in \\nthe neonatal period; VLBW infants have a 200-fold higher risk of \\nneonatal death. The LBW rate has not improved in recent years \\nand is one of the major reasons that the U.S. infant mortality \\nrate is high compared with other large, modern, industrialized \\ncountries.\\nMaternal factors associated with a LBW caused by premature \\nbirth or IUGR include a previous LBW birth, low socioeconomic \\nstatus, low level of maternal education, no antenatal care, \\nmaternal age younger than 16 years or older than 35 years, \\nshort interval between pregnancies, cigarette smoking, alcohol \\nand illicit drug use, physical (excessive standing or walking) \\nor psychological (poor social support) stresses, unmarried \\nstatus, low prepregnancy weight (<45 kg), p oor weight gain \\nduring pregnancy (<10 l b), and African American race.

Periodic changes of the heart rate relative to uterine \\npressure help determine the presence of hypoxia and acidosis \\ncaused by uteroplacental insufficiency or maternal hypotension \\n(late or type II decelerations) or by umbilical cord compression \\n(variable decelerations). In the presence of severe decelerations \\n(late or repeated prolonged variable), a fetal scalp blood gas \\nlevel should be obtained to assess fetal acidosis. A scalp pH \\nof less than 7.20 indicates fetal hypoxic compromise. A pH \\nbetween 7.20 and 7.25 is in a borderline zone and warrants \\nrepeat testing.\\nFetal anomalies may be detected by ultrasonography. \\nEmphasis should be placed on visualization of the genitourinary \\ntract; the head (for anencephaly or hydrocephaly), neck (for \\nthickened nuchal translucency), and back (for spina bifida); \\nskeleton; gastrointestinal tract; and heart. Four-chamber and \\ngreat artery views are required for detection of heart anomalies. \\nChromosomal anomaly syndromes are often associated with \\nan abnormal “quadruple test” (low unconjugated estriols, low \\nmaternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, high inhibin A, and \\nelevated placental chorionic gonadotropin levels). Fetal genetic \\nand chromosomal disorders can also be detected by analyzing \\nfree fetal DNA that is present in the maternal circulation. If \\na fetal abnormality is detected, fetal therapy or delivery with \\ntherapy in the neonatal intensive care unit may be lifesaving.\\nASSESSMENT OF THE NEWBORN\\nThe approach to the birth of an infant requires a detailed history \\n(Table 58.3). Knowing the mother’s risk factors enables the \\ndelivery room team to anticipate problems that may occur after \\nbirth. The history of a woman’s labor and delivery can reveal \\nevents that might lead to complications affecting either the \\nmother or the neonate, even when the pregnancy was previously \\nconsidered low risk. Anticipating the need to resuscitate a \\nnewborn as a result of fetal distress increases the likelihood of \\nsuccessful resuscitation.\\nThe transition from fetal to neonatal physiology occurs at \\nbirth. Oxygen transport across the placenta results in a gradient \\nbetween the maternal and fetal PaO2. Although fetal oxygenated \\nblood has a low Pa O2 level compared with that of adults and \\ninfants, the fetus is not anaerobic. Fetal oxygen uptake and \\nconsumption are similar to neonatal rates, even though the \\nthermal environments and activity levels of fetuses and neonates \\ndiffer. The oxygen content of fetal blood is almost equal to the \\noxygen content in older infants and children because fetal blood \\nhas a much higher concentration of hemoglobin.\\nFetal hemoglobin (two alpha and two gamma chains) has a \\nhigher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, facilitating \\noxygen transfer across the placenta. The fetal hemoglobin-oxygen \\ndissociation curve is shifted to the left of the adult curve (Fig. \\n58.1); at the same PaO2 level, fetal hemoglobin is more saturated \\nthan adult hemoglobin. Because fetal hemoglobin functions \\non the steep, lower end of the oxygen saturation curve (PaO2, \\nsurfactant, the determination of lecithin in amniotic fluid is \\nused to predict a mature fetus. Lecithin concentration increases \\nwith increasing gestational age, beginning at 32-34 weeks.\\nMethods used to assess fetal well-being before the onset of \\nlabor are focused on identifying a fetus at risk for asphyxia or \\na fetus already compromised by uteroplacental insufficiency. \\nThe oxytocin challenge test  simulates uterine contractions \\nthrough an infusion of oxytocin sufficient to produce three \\ncontractions in a 10-minute period. The development of periodic \\nfetal bradycardia out of phase with uterine contractions (late \\ndeceleration) is a positive test result and predicts an at-risk fetus.\\nThe nonstress test examines the heart rate response to fetal \\nbody movements. Heart rate increases of more than 15 beats/\\nmin lasting 15 seconds are reassuring. If two such episodes \\noccur in 30 minutes, the test result is considered reactive \\n(versus nonreactive), and the fetus is not at risk. Additional \\nsigns of fetal well-being are fetal breathing movements, gross \\nbody movements, fetal tone, and the presence of amniotic fluid \\npockets more than 2  cm in size , detected by ultrasound. The \\nbiophysical profile combines the nonstress test with these four \\nparameters and offers the most accurate fetal assessment.\\nDoppler examination of the fetal aorta or umbilical arteries \\npermits identification of decreased or reversed diastolic blood \\nflow associated with increased peripheral vascular resistance, \\nfetal hypoxia with acidosis, and placental insufficiency. Cordo-\\ncentesis (percutaneous umbilical blood sampling) can provide \\nfetal blood for PaO2, pH, lactate, and hemoglobin measurements \\nto identify a hypoxic, acidotic, or anemic fetus that is at risk \\nfor intrauterine fetal demise or birth asphyxia.

This mixture of venous \\nlow-oxygenated blood from the upper and lower body enters the \\npulmonary artery. Only 8-10% of it is pumped to the pulmonary \\ncircuit; the remaining 80-92% of the right ventricular output \\nbypasses the lungs through a patent ductus arteriosus  and \\nenters the descending aorta. The amount of blood flowing to \\nthe pulmonary system is low because vasoconstriction produced \\nby medial muscle hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles \\nand fluid in the fetal lung increases resistance to blood flow. \\nPulmonary artery tone also responds to hypoxia, hypercapnia, \\nand acidosis with vasoconstriction, a response that may increase \\npulmonary vascular resistance further. The ductus arteriosus \\nremains patent in the fetus because of low PaO2 levels and dilating \\nprostaglandins.

Persistence or aggravation of pulmonary vasoconstric-\\ntion caused by acidosis, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, \\npolycythemia, asphyxia, shunting of blood from the lungs, \\nor pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia results in persistent \\npulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Failure to \\nreplace pulmonary alveolar fluid completely with air can lead \\nto respiratory distress (transient tachypnea of the newborn).\\nRoutine Delivery Room Care and Resuscitation\\nSilver nitrate (1%) instilled into both eyes without being washed \\nout is an indicated effective therapy for the prevention of \\nneonatal gonococcal ophthalmia, which can result in severe \\npanophthalmitis and subsequent blindness. Silver nitrate may \\nproduce a chemical conjunctivitis with a mucopurulent discharge \\nand is not effective against C. trachomatis. Many hospitals use \\nerythromycin drops to prevent neonatal gonococcal and \\nchlamydial eye disease.\\nBacterial colonization of a newborn may begin in utero if \\nthe fetal membranes have been ruptured. Most infants undergo \\ncolonization after birth and acquire the bacteria present in the \\nmother’s genitourinary system, such as group B streptococci, \\nstaphylococci, E. coli, and clostridia. Antiseptic skin or cord care \\nis routine in most nurseries to prevent the spread of pathological \\nbacteria from one infant to another and to prevent disease in the \\nindividual infant. Staphylococcal bullous impetigo, omphalitis, \\ndiarrhea, and systemic disease may result from colonization \\nwith virulent S. aureus. Triple antibiotic ointment (polymyxin \\nB, neomycin, and bacitracin) or bacitracin may be applied to \\nthe umbilical cord to reduce its colonization with gram-positive \\nbacteria. Epidemics of S. aureus nursery infections are managed \\nwith strict infectious disease control measures (cohorting, hand \\nwashing, and monitoring for colonization).\\nVitamin K prophylaxis (intramuscular) should be given \\nto all infants to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. \\nBefore discharge, infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine \\nand be screened for various diseases (Tables 58.4 and 58.5).\\nFetal or neonatal hypoxia, hypercapnia, poor cardiac output, \\nand a metabolic acidosis can result from numerous conditions \\naffecting the fetus, the placenta, or the mother. Whether in utero \\nor after birth, asphyxia-caused hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is \\nthe result of reduced gaseous exchange through the placenta or \\nthrough the lungs. Asphyxia associated with severe bradycardia \\nor cardiac insufficiency reduces or eliminates tissue blood flow, \\nresulting in ischemia. The fetal and neonatal circulatory systems \\nrespond to reduced oxygen availability by shunting the blood \\npreferentially to the brain, heart, and adrenal glands and away \\nfrom the intestine, kidneys, lungs, and skin.\\nMetabolic acidosis during asphyxia is caused by the combined \\neffects of poor cardiac output secondary to hypoxic depression \\nof myocardial function, systemic hypoxia, and tissue anaerobic \\nmetabolism. With severe or prolonged intrauterine or neonatal \\nasphyxia, multiple vital organs are affected (Table 58.6).\\nMany conditions that contribute to fetal or neonatal asphyxia \\nare the same medical or obstetric problems associated with high-\\nrisk pregnancy (Table 58.7). Maternal diseases that interfere with \\nuteroplacental perfusion (chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, \\nand diabetes mellitus) place the fetus at risk for intrauterine \\nasphyxia. Maternal epidural anesthesia and the development of \\nthe vena caval compression syndrome may produce maternal \\nwhich is a high volume (450 mL/kg/min) co mpared with that \\npumped by an older infant’s right ventricle (200 mL/kg/min).\\nThe transition of the circulation, occurring between the fetal \\nand neonatal periods, involves the removal of the low-resistance \\ncirculation of the placenta, the onset of breathing, reduction of \\npulmonary arterial resistance, and closure of in utero shunts. \\nClamping the umbilical cord eliminates the low-pressure system \\nof the placenta and increases systemic blood pressure. Decreased \\nvenous return from the placenta decreases right atrial pressure. \\nAs breathing begins, air replaces lung fluid, maintaining the \\nfunctional residual capacity. Fluid leaves the lung, in part, \\nthrough the trachea; it is either swallowed or squeezed out \\nduring vaginal delivery. The pulmonary lymphatic and venous \\nsystems reabsorb the remaining fluid.\\nMost normal infants require little pressure to spontaneously \\nopen the lungs after birth (5-10  cm H2O). With the onset of \\nbreathing, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, partly a \\nresult of the mechanics of breathing and partly a result of the \\nelevated arterial oxygen tensions. The increased blood flow to the \\nlungs increases the volume of pulmonary venous blood returning \\nto the left atrium; left atrial pressure now exceeds right atrial \\npressure, and the foramen ovale closes. As the flow through the \\npulmonary circulation increases and arterial oxygen tensions \\nrise, the ductus arteriosus begins to constrict. In a term infant, \\nthis constriction functionally closes the ductus arteriosus within \\n1 day after birth. A permanent closure requires thrombosis and \\nfibrosis, a process that may take several weeks. In a premature \\ninfant, the ductus arteriosus is less sensitive to the effects of \\noxygen; if circulating levels of vasodilating prostaglandins are \\nelevated, the ductus arteriosus may remain patent. This patency \\nis a common problem in a premature infant with respiratory \\ndistress syndrome.\\nVentilation, oxygenation, and normal pH and P CO2 levels \\nimmediately reduce pulmonary artery vasoconstriction by \\ncausing smooth muscle relaxation.

In \\naddition to an Apgar score of 0-3, most infants with asphyxia \\nsevere enough to cause neurological injury also manifest fetal \\nacidosis (pH <7); seizures, coma, or hypotonia; and multiorgan \\ndysfunction. Low Apgar scores may be caused by fetal hypoxia \\nor other factors listed in Table 58.7. Most infants with low \\nApgar scores respond to assisted ventilation by face mask or \\nby endotracheal intubation and usually do not need emergency \\nmedication.\\nResuscitation of a newborn with a low Apgar score follows \\nthe same systematic sequence as that for resuscitation of older \\npatients, but in the newborn period this simplified ABCD \\napproach requires some qualification (Fig. 58.2). In the ABCD \\napproach, A stands for securing a patent airway by clearing \\namniotic fluid or meconium by suctioning; A is also a reminder \\nof anticipation and the need for knowing the events of pregnancy, \\nlabor, and delivery. Evidence of a diaphragmatic hernia and a \\nlow Apgar score indicate that immediate endotracheal intubation \\nis required. If a mask and bag are used, gas enters the lung and \\nthe stomach, and the latter may act as an expanding mass in the \\nchest that compromises respiration. If fetal hydrops has occurred \\nwith pleural effusions, bilateral thoracentesis to evacuate the \\npleural effusions may be needed to establish adequate ventilation.\\nB represents breathing. If the neonate is apneic or hypoven-\\ntilating and remains cyanotic, artificial ventilation should be \\ninitiated. Ventilation should be performed with a well-fitted \\nmask attached to an anesthesia bag and a manometer to prevent \\nextremely high pressures from being given to the newborn; \\n100% oxygen should be administered through the mask. If \\nthe infant does not revive, an endotracheal tube should be \\nplaced, attached to the anesthesia bag and manometer, and \\n100% oxygen should be administered. The pressure generated \\nshould begin at 20-25  cm H2O, with a rate of 40-60 breaths/\\nminute. An adequate response to ventilation includes good \\nchest rise, return of breath sounds, well-oxygenated color, \\nheart rate returning to the normal range (120-160 beats/min), \\nnormal end-tidal carbon dioxide, and, later, increased muscle \\nactivity and wakefulness. The usual recovery after a cardiac \\narrest first involves a return to a normal heart rate, followed by \\ndisappearance of cyanosis and noticeably improved perfusion. \\ndeficiency may result in poor air exchange, retractions, hypoxia, \\nand apnea.\\nThe newborn (particularly a preterm infant) responds \\nparadoxically to hypoxia with apnea rather than tachypnea as \\noccurs in adults. Episodes of intrauterine asphyxia also may \\ndepress the neonatal central nervous system. If recovery of the \\nfetal heart rate occurs as a result of improved uteroplacental \\nperfusion, fetal hypoxia and acidosis may resolve. Nonetheless, \\nif the effect on the respiratory center is more severe, a newborn \\nmay not initiate an adequate ventilatory response at birth and \\nmay undergo another episode of asphyxia.\\nThe Apgar examination, a rapid scoring system based on \\nphysiological responses to the birth process, is a good method \\nfor assessing the need to resuscitate a newborn (Table 58.8). \\nAt intervals of 1 and 5 minutes after birth, each of the five \\nphysiological parameters is observed or elicited by a qualified \\nexaminer. Full-term infants with a normal cardiopulmonary \\nadaptation should score 8-9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Apgar scores \\nof 4-7 warrant close attention to determine whether the infant’s \\nstatus will improve and to ascertain whether any pathological \\ncondition is contributing to the low Apgar score.\\nBy definition, an Apgar score of 0-3 represents either a \\ncardiopulmonary arrest or a condition caused by severe bra-\\ndycardia, hypoventilation, or central nervous system depression. \\nMost low Apgar scores are caused by difficulty in establishing \\nTABLE 58.7 Etiology of Birth Asphyxia\\nTYPE EXAMPLE\\nINTRAUTERINE\\nHypoxia-ischemia Uteroplacental insufficiency, abruptio placentae, prolapsed cord, maternal hypotension, unknown\\nAnemia-shock Vasa previa, placenta previa, fetomaternal hemorrhage, erythroblastosis\\nINTRAPARTUM\\nBirth trauma Cephalopelvic disproportion, shoulder dystocia, breech presentation, spinal cord transection\\nHypoxia-ischemia Umbilical cord compression, tetanic uterine contraction, abruptio placentae\\nPOSTPARTUM\\nCentral nervous system Maternal medication, trauma, previous episodes of fetal hypoxia-acidosis\\nCongenital neuromuscular disease Congenital myasthenia gravis, myopathy, myotonic dystrophy\\nInfection Consolidated pneumonia, shock\\nAirway disorder Choanal atresia, severe obstructing goiter or tumor, laryngeal webs\\nPulmonary disorder Severe immaturity, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia\\nRenal disorder Pulmonary hypoplasia, pneumothorax\\nTABLE 58.8 Apgar Score\\nSIGNS\\nPOINTS\\n0 1 2\\nHeart rate 0 <100/min >100/min\\nRespiration None Weak cry Vigorous cry\\nMuscle tone None Some extremity \\nflexion\\nArms, legs well flexed\\nReflex \\nirritability\\nNone Some motion Cry, withdrawal\\nColor of body Blue Pink body, blue \\nextremities\\nPink all over\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Problems in the transition \\nfrom fetal to neonatal life may be detectable immediately in \\nthe delivery room or during the first day of life. Physical \\nexamination also may reveal effects of the labor and delivery \\nresulting from asphyxia, drugs, or birth trauma. The first \\nnewborn examination is an important way to detect congenital \\nmalformations or deformations (Table 58.9). Significant con-\\ngenital malformations may be present in 1-3% of all births.\\nAppearance\\nSigns such as cyanosis, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, \\nand grunting suggest pulmonary disease. Meconium staining \\nof the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and \\nthe possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous \\nactivity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are \\nuseful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system.\\nVital Signs\\nThe examination should proceed with an assessment of vital \\nsigns, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120-160 beats/min), \\nrespiratory rate (normal rate, 30-60 breaths/min), temperature \\n(usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement), \\nand blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, \\nweight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted \\non growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, \\naccelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age.\\nGestational Age\\nGestational age is determined by an assessment of various \\nphysical signs (Fig. 58.3) and neuromuscular characteristics \\n(Fig. 58.4) that vary according to fetal age and maturity. Physical \\ncriteria mature with advancing fetal age, including increasing \\nfirmness of the pinna of the ear; increasing size of the breast \\ntissue; decreasing fine, immature lanugo hair over the back; \\nand decreasing opacity of the skin. Neurological criteria mature \\nwith gestational age, including increasing flexion of the legs, \\nhips, and arms; increasing tone of the flexor muscles of the \\nneck; and decreasing laxity of the joints. These signs are \\ndetermined during the first day of life and are assigned scores. \\nneeded because most infants in the delivery room respond to  \\nventilation.\\nD represents the administration of drugs. If bradycardia is \\nunresponsive to ventilation or if asystole is present, epineph -\\nrine should be administered. Intravenous (IV) epinephrine \\n(1 :  10,000), 0.1-0.3  mL/kg , should be given through an umbilical \\nvenous line or injected into the endotracheal tube. However, \\nwhen epinephrine is administered through the endotracheal \\ntube, the result is often unpredictable. Before medications are \\nadministered in the presence of electrical cardiac activity with \\npoor pulses, it is important to determine whether there is a \\npneumothorax. Transillumination of the thorax, involving the \\nuse of a bright light through each side of the thorax and over \\nthe sternum, may suggest pneumothorax if one side transmits \\nmore light than the other. Breath sounds may be decreased over \\na pneumothorax and there may be a shift of the heart tones \\naway from the side of a tension pneumothorax.\\nIf central nervous system depression in the infant may be \\ndue to a narcotic medication given to the mother, 0.1  m g/kg \\nof naloxone (Narcan) can be given to the infant intravenously \\nor endotracheally. Before this drug is administered, the ABCs \\nshould be followed carefully. Naloxone should not be given to \\na newborn of a mother who is suspected of being addicted to \\nnarcotics or is on methadone maintenance because the newborn \\nmay experience severe withdrawal seizures.\\nIn babies of more than 35 weeks’ gestation suffering moderate \\nto severe hypoxic-ischemic injury at birth, induced therapeutic \\nhypothermia (33.0-34.0°C) for 72 hours has been shown in \\nclinical studies to be efficacious in reducing the severity of brain \\ninjury. Brain hypothermia, whether induced by whole-body \\nor selective head cooling, provides neuroprotection against \\nencephalopathy presumably due to hypoxic ischemia.\\nPhysical Examination and Gestational  \\nAge Assessment\\nThe first physical examination of a newborn may be a general \\nphysical examination of a well infant or an examination to \\nconfirm fetal diagnoses or to determine the cause of various \\nTABLE 58.9 Life-Threatening Congenital Anomalies\\nNAME MANIFESTATIONS\\nChoanal atresia (stenosis) Respiratory distress in delivery room, apnea, unable to pass nasogastric tube through nares\\nPierre Robin syndrome Micrognathia, cleft palate, airway obstruction\\nDiaphragmatic hernia Scaphoid abdomen, bowel sounds present in left chest, heart shifted to right, respiratory distress, \\npolyhydramnios\\nTracheoesophageal fistula Polyhydramnios, aspiration pneumonia, excessive salivation, unable to place nasogastric tube in \\nstomach\\nIntestinal obstruction: volvulus, \\nduodenal atresia, ileal atresia\\nPolyhydramnios, bile-stained emesis, abdominal distention\\nGastroschisis/omphalocele Polyhydramnios; intestinal obstruction\\nRenal agenesis/Potter syndrome Oligohydramnios, anuria, pulmonary hypoplasia, pneumothorax\\nHydronephrosis Bilateral abdominal masses\\nNeural tube defects: anencephaly, \\nmeningomyelocele\\nPolyhydramnios, elevated α-fetoprotein; decreased fetal activity\\nDown syndrome (trisomy 21) Hypotonia, congenital heart disease, duodenal atresia\\nDuctal-dependent congenital heart \\ndisease\\nCyanosis, murmur, shock\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle \\nwith a fibrous tumor over the muscle produces head tilt and \\nasymmetrical facies (neonatal torticollis). Arnold-Chiari \\nmalformation and cervical spine lesions also produce torticollis. \\nEdema and webbing of the neck suggest Turner syndrome. \\nBoth clavicles should be palpated for fractures.\\nExamination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall \\nto identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis \\nmuscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gesta-\\ntional age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have \\nbreast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should \\nnot be attempted. Supernumerary nipples  may be bilateral \\nand may be associated with renal anomalies.\\nLungs\\nExamination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, \\ndepth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath \\nsounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales \\nshould not be heard after the first 1-2 hours of life. Diminished \\nor absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, \\ncollapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift  \\nof the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and \\ndiaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful \\nphysical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous \\nemphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax \\nor pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in \\nthe chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a \\ndiaphragmatic hernia.\\nFace, Eyes, and Mouth\\nThe face should be inspected for dysmorphic features, such as \\nepicanthal folds, hypertelorism, preauricular tags or sinuses, \\nlow-set ears, long philtrum, and cleft lip or palate. Facial asym-\\nmetry may be a result of seventh nerve palsy; head tilt may be \\ncaused by torticollis.\\nThe eyes should open spontaneously, especially in an upright \\nposition. Before 28 weeks’ gestational age, the eyelids may be \\nfused. Coloboma, megalocornea, and microphthalmia suggest \\nother malformations or intrauterine infections. A cloudy cornea \\ngreater than 1 cm in diameter also may be seen in congenital \\nglaucoma, uveal tract dysgenesis, and storage diseases. Con -\\njunctival and retinal hemorrhages are common and usually of \\nno significance. The pupillary response to light is present at 28 \\nweeks of gestation. The red reflex of the retina is shown easily. \\nA white reflex, or leukokoria, is abnormal and may be the \\nresult of cataracts, ocular tumor, severe chorioretinitis, persistent \\nhyperplastic primary vitreous, or retinopathy of prematurity.\\nThe mouth should be inspected for the presence of natal \\nteeth, clefts of the soft and hard palate and uvula, and micro -\\ngnathia. A bifid uvula suggests a submucosal cleft. White, shiny, \\nmultiple transient epidermal inclusion cysts (Epstein pearls) on \\nthe hard palate are normal.

Clitoral enlargement with fusion \\nof the labial-scrotal folds (labia majora) suggests adrenogenital \\nsyndrome or exposure to masculinizing maternal hormones.\\nExtremities\\nExamination of the extremities should involve assessment of \\nlength, symmetry, and presence of hemihypertrophy, atrophy, \\npolydactyly, syndactyly, simian creases, absent fingers, overlap-\\nping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, clubfoot, congenital bands, \\nfractures, and amputations.\\nSpine\\nThe spine should be examined for evidence of sacral hair tufts, \\na dermal sinus tract above the gluteal folds, congenital scoliosis \\n(a result of hemivertebra), and soft tissue masses such as lipomas \\nor meningomyeloceles.\\nHips\\nThe hips should be examined for congenital dysplasia (disloca-\\ntion). Gluteal fold asymmetry or leg length discrepancy is \\nsuggestive of dysplasia, but the examiner should perform the \\nBarlow test and the Ortolani maneuver to evaluate the stability \\nof the hip joint. These tests determine whether the femoral \\nhead can be displaced from the acetabulum (Barlow test) and \\nthen replaced (Ortolani maneuver).\\nNEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT\\nThe neurological examination should include assessment of \\nactive and passive tone, level of alertness, primary neonatal \\n(primitive) reflexes, deep tendon reflexes, spontaneous motor \\nactivity, and cranial nerves (involving retinal examination, \\nextraocular muscle movement, masseter power as in sucking, \\nfacial motility, hearing, and tongue function). The Moro reflex, \\npresent at birth and gone in 3-6 months, is one of the primary \\nnewborn reflexes. It is elicited by sudden, slight dropping of \\nthe supported head from a slightly raised supine position, which \\nshould elicit opening of the hands and extension and abduction \\nof the arms, followed by upper extremity flexion and a cry. The \\npalmar grasp is present by 28 weeks’ gestation and gone by 4 \\nmonths of age. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk in a normal \\nnewborn; 5-10 beats of ankle clonus are normal. The Babinski \\nsign is extensor (upgoing). The sensory examination can be \\nevaluated by withdrawal of an extremity, grimace, and cry in \\nresponse to painful stimuli.

Heart \\nmurmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and \\nduring the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient \\nand are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral \\npulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. \\nPulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities \\n(over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the \\nupper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients \\nwith a murmur or heart failure.

Less often, masses \\nindicate ovarian cysts, intestinal duplication, neuroblastoma, \\nor mesoblastic nephroma. Masses should be evaluated imme-\\ndiately with ultrasound. Abdominal distention may be caused \\nby intestinal obstructions, such as ileal atresia, meconium ileus, \\nmidgut volvulus, imperforate anus, or Hirschsprung disease. \\nMeconium stool is passed normally within 48 hours of birth in \\n99% of term infants. The anus should be patent. An imperforate \\nanus is not always visible; the first temperature taken with a \\nrectal thermometer should be taken carefully. The abdominal \\nwall musculature may be absent, as in prune-belly syndrome, \\nor weak, resulting in diastasis recti. Umbilical hernias are \\ncommon in African American infants. The umbilical cord \\nshould be inspected to determine the presence of two arteries \\nand one vein and the absence of an urachus or a herniation \\nof abdominal contents, as occurs with an omphalocele. The \\nlatter is associated with extraintestinal problems, such as genetic \\ntrisomies and hypoglycemia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome). \\nBleeding from the cord suggests a coagulation disorder, and a \\nchronic discharge may be a granuloma of the umbilical stump or, \\nless frequently, a draining omphalomesenteric cyst or urachus. \\nErythema around the umbilicus is omphalitis and may cause \\nportal vein thrombophlebitis and subsequent extrahepatic portal \\nhypertension.

Occasionally a premature infant may \\ndevelop a massive scalp hemorrhage. This subgaleal bleeding \\nand the bleeding noted from a cephalhematoma may cause \\nindirect hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. Retinal \\nand subconjunctival hemorrhages  are common but usually \\nare small and insignificant; no treatment is necessary.\\nSpinal cord  or spine injuries  may occur in the fetus as \\na result of the hyperextended star gazing  posture. Injuries \\nalso may occur in infants after excessive rotational (at C3-4) \\nor longitudinal (at C7-T1) force is transmitted to the neck \\nduring vertex or breech delivery. Fractures of vertebrae are rare; \\ntrauma may cause direct damage to the spinal cord, leading \\nto transection and permanent sequelae, hemorrhage, edema, \\nand neurological signs. Rarely, a snapping sound indicating \\ncord transection rather than vertebral displacement is heard at \\nthe time of delivery. Neurological dysfunction usually involves \\ncomplete flaccid paralysis, absence of deep tendon reflexes, \\nand absence of responses to painful stimuli below the lesion. \\nPainful stimuli may elicit reflex flexion of the legs. Infants with \\nspinal cord injury often are flaccid, apneic, and asphyxiated, \\nall of which may mask the underlying spinal cord transection.\\nInjury to the nerves of the brachial plexus may result from \\nexcessive traction on the neck, producing paresis or complete \\nparalysis. The mildest injury (neurapraxia) is edema; axonotmesis \\nis more severe and consists of disrupted nerve fibers with an \\nintact myelin sheath; neurotmesis, or complete nerve disrup -\\ntion or root avulsion, is most severe. Erb-Duchenne paralysis \\ninvolves the fifth and sixth cervical nerves and is the most \\ncommon and usually mildest injury. The infant cannot abduct \\nthe arm at the shoulder, externally rotate the arm, or supinate \\nthe forearm. The usual picture is one of painless adduction, \\ninternal rotation of the arm, and pronation of the forearm. The \\nMoro reflex is absent on the involved side, and the hand grasp \\nis intact. Phrenic nerve palsy  (C3, C4, and C5) may lead to \\ndiaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory distress. Elevation of \\nthe diaphragm caused by nerve injury must be differentiated \\nfrom elevation caused by eventration resulting from congenital \\nweakness or absence of diaphragm muscle. Klumpke paralysis \\nis caused by injury to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves \\nand the first thoracic nerve, resulting in a paralyzed hand and, \\nif the sympathetic nerves are injured, an ipsilateral Horner \\nsyndrome (ptosis, miosis). Complete arm and hand paralysis is \\nnoted with the most severe form of damage to C5, C6, C7, C8, \\nand T1. Treatment of brachial plexus injury is supportive and \\nincludes positioning to avoid contractures. Active and passive \\nrange of motion exercises also may be beneficial. If the deficit \\npersists, nerve grafting may be beneficial.\\nFacial nerve injury may be the result of compression of the \\nseventh nerve between the facial bone and the mother’s pelvic \\nbones or the physician’s forceps. This peripheral nerve injury \\nis characterized by an asymmetric crying face whose normal \\nside, including the forehead, moves in a regular manner. The \\naffected side is flaccid, the eye does not close, the nasolabial \\nfold is absent, and the side of the mouth droops at rest. If \\nthere is a central injury to the facial nerve, only the lower two \\nthirds of the face (not the forehead) are involved. Complete \\nagenesis of the facial nucleus results in a central facial paralysis; \\nwhen this is bilateral, as in Möbius syndrome, the face appears \\nexpressionless.\\nSkull fractures are rare, are usually linear, and require no \\ntreatment other than observation for very rare, delayed (1-3 \\nbowel on the abdominal wall. Omphalocele is often associated \\nwith other malformations, whereas intestinal necrosis is more \\ncommon in gastroschisis.\\nShock\\nShock in the delivery room is manifested by pallor, poor capillary \\nrefill time, lack of palpable pulses, hypotonia, cyanosis, and \\neventually cardiopulmonary arrest. Blood loss before or during \\nlabor and delivery is a common cause of shock in the delivery \\nroom. Blood loss may be caused by fetal-maternal hemorrhage, \\nplacenta previa, vasa previa, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, \\nor displacement of blood from the fetus to the placenta as \\nduring asphyxia (asphyxia pallida). Hemorrhage into a viscus, \\nsuch as the liver or spleen, may be noted in macrosomic infants, \\nand hemorrhage into the cerebral ventricles may produce shock \\nand apnea in preterm infants. Anemia, hypoalbuminemia, \\nhypovolemia, and shock at birth are common manifestations \\nof Rh immune hydrops.\\nSevere intrauterine bacterial sepsis may present with shock in \\nthe delivery room or immediately after the infant is transferred \\nto the nursery. Typically these infants are mottled, hypotonic, \\nand cyanotic and have diminished peripheral pulses. They \\nhave a normal hemoglobin concentration but may manifest \\nneutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular \\ncoagulation. Peripheral symmetrical gangrene (purpuric rash) \\noften is a sign of hypotensive shock in infants with severe \\ncongenital bacterial infections. Congenital left ventricular \\ncardiac obstruction (critical aortic stenosis or hypoplastic left  \\nheart syndrome) also produces shock, although not usually in \\nthe delivery room.\\nTreatment of newborn infants with shock should involve \\nthe management approaches used for the sick infant. Problems \\nmay be anticipated through knowledge of the infant’s immune \\nstatus, evidence of hydrops, or suspicion of intrauterine infec-\\ntion or anomalies. Stabilization of the airway and institution of \\nrespiratory support are essential. Hypovolemic shock should \\nbe managed with repeated boluses of 10-15 mL/kg of normal \\nsaline or lactated Ringer solution. If severe immune hemolysis \\nis predicted, blood typed against the mother’s blood should \\nbe available in the delivery room and should be given to the \\nnewborn if signs of anemia and shock are present. Thereafter, \\nall blood should be crossmatched with the infant’s and mother’s \\nblood before transfusion. Drugs such as dopamine, epinephrine, \\nor cortisol may improve cardiac output and tissue perfusion.\\nBirth Injury\\nBirth injury refers to avoidable and unavoidable injury to the \\nfetus during the birth process. Caput succedaneum is a diffuse, \\nedematous, often dark swelling of the soft tissue of the scalp \\nthat extends across the midline and suture lines. In infants \\ndelivered from a face presentation, soft tissue edema of the \\neyelids and face is an equivalent phenomenon. Caput succe -\\ndaneum may be seen after prolonged labor in full-term and \\npreterm infants. Molding of the head often is associated with \\ncaput succedaneum and is the result of pressure that is induced \\nfrom overriding the parietal and frontal bones against their \\nrespective sutures.\\nA cephalhematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage that \\ndoes not cross the suture lines surrounding the respective \\nbones. A linear skull fracture rarely may be seen underlying a \\ncephalhematoma. With time, the cephalhematoma may organize, \\ncalcify, and form a central depression.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Brown fat is highly vascular, \\ncontains many mitochondria per cell, and is situated around large \\nblood vessels, resulting in rapid heat transfer to the circulation. \\nThe vessels of the neck, thorax, and interscapular region are \\ncommon locations of brown fat. These tissues also are innervated \\nby the sympathetic nervous system, which serves as a primary \\nstimulus for heat production by brown adipose cells. Shivering \\ndoes not occur in newborns.\\nSevere cold injury in an infant is manifested by acidosis, \\nhypoxia, hypoglycemia, apnea, bradycardia, pulmonary hemor-\\nrhage, and a pink skin color. The color is caused by trapping \\nof oxygenated hemoglobin in the cutaneous capillaries. Many \\nof these infants appear dead, but most respond to treatment \\nand recover. Milder degrees of cold injury in the delivery room \\nmay contribute to metabolic acidosis and hypoxia after birth. \\nConversely, hypoxia delays heat generation in cold-stressed \\ninfants.\\nTreatment of severe hypothermia should involve resuscita-\\ntion and rapid warming of core (e.g., lung and stomach) and \\nexternal surfaces. Fluid resuscitation also is needed to treat \\nhypovolemia seen in many of these infants. Reduced core \\ntemperature (32-35°C) in the immediate newborn period \\noften requires only external warming with a radiant warmer, \\nincubator, or both.\\nElevated Temperature\\nExposure to ambient temperatures above the neutral thermal \\nenvironment results in heat stress and an elevated core tem -\\nperature. Sweating is uncommon in newborns and may be \\nnoted only on the forehead. In response to moderate heat stress, \\ninfants may increase their respiratory rate to dissipate heat. \\nExcessive environmental temperatures may result in heatstroke \\nor in hemorrhagic shock encephalopathy syndrome.\\nMISCELLANEOUS DISORDERS\\nHypocalcemia\\nmonths) complications (e.g., leptomeningeal cyst). Depressed \\nskull fractures are unusual but may be seen with complicated \\nforceps delivery and may need surgical elevation. Fractures of \\nthe clavicle usually are unilateral and are noted in macrosomic \\ninfants after shoulder dystocia. Often a snap is heard after a \\ndifficult delivery, and the infant exhibits an asymmetrical Moro \\nresponse and decreased movement of the affected side. The \\nprognosis is excellent; many infants require no treatment or a \\nsimple figure of eight bandage to immobilize the bone.\\nExtremity fractures are less common than fractures of the \\nclavicle and involve the humerus more often than the femur. \\nTreatment involves immobilization and a triangular splint \\nbandage for the humerus and traction suspension of the legs \\nfor femoral fractures. The prognosis is excellent.\\nFractures of the facial bones are rare, but dislocation of \\nthe cartilaginous part of the nasal septum out of the vomeral \\ngroove and columella is common. Clinical manifestations \\ninclude feeding difficulty, respiratory distress, asymmetrical \\nnares, and a flattened, laterally displaced nose. Treatment \\nreduces the dislocation by elevating the cartilage back into \\nthe vomeral groove.\\nVisceral trauma to the liver, spleen, or adrenal gland occurs \\nin macrosomic infants and in extremely premature infants, \\nwith or without breech or vaginal delivery. Rupture of the liver \\nwith subcapsular hematoma formation may lead to anemia, \\nhypovolemia, shock, hemoperitoneum, and disseminated \\nintravascular coagulation. Infants with anemia and shock who \\nare suspected to have an intraventricular hemorrhage but with \\na normal head ultrasound examination should be evaluated \\nfor hepatic or splenic rupture. Adrenal hemorrhage may be \\nasymptomatic, detected only by finding calcified adrenal glands \\nin normal infants. Infants with severe adrenal hemorrhage may \\nexhibit a flank mass, jaundice, and hematuria, with or without  \\nshock.\\nTemperature Regulation\\nAfter birth, a newborn remains covered by amniotic fluid and \\nsituated in a cold environment (20-25°C). An infant’s skin \\ntemperature may decrease 0.3°C/min, and the core temperature \\nmay decrease 0.1°C/min in the delivery room. In the absence \\nof an external heat source, the infant must increase metabolism \\nsubstantially to maintain body temperature.\\nHeat loss occurs through four basic mechanisms. In the \\ncold delivery room, the wet infant loses heat predominantly \\nby evaporation (cutaneous and respiratory loss when wet or in \\nlow humidity), radiation (loss to nearby cold, solid surfaces), \\nand convection (loss to air current). When the infant is dry, \\nradiation, convection, and conduction (loss to object in direct \\ncontact with infant) are important causes of heat loss. After birth, \\nall high-risk infants should be dried immediately to eliminate \\nevaporative heat losses. A radiant or convective heat source \\nshould be provided for these high-risk infants. Normal term \\ninfants should be dried and wrapped in a blanket.\\nThe ideal environmental temperature is the neutral thermal \\nenvironment, the ambient temperature that results in the \\nlowest rate of heat being produced by the infant and maintains \\nnormal body temperature. The neutral thermal environmental \\ntemperature decreases with increasing gestational and postnatal \\nage. Ambient temperatures less than the neutral thermal envi-\\nronment result in increasing rates of oxygen consumption for \\nheat production, which is designed to maintain normal body \\ntemperature.

Clinical manifestations of \\nwithdrawal include sneezing, yawning, ravenous appetite, emesis, \\ndiarrhea, fever, diaphoresis, tachypnea, high-pitched cry, tremors, \\njitteriness, poor sleep, poor feeding, and seizures. The illness \\ntends to be more severe during methadone withdrawal. The \\ninitial treatment includes swaddling in blankets in a quiet, dark \\nroom. When hyperactivity is constant, and irritability interferes \\nwith sleeping and feeding, or when diarrhea or seizures are \\npresent, pharmacological treatment is indicated. Seizures usually \\nare treated with phenobarbital. The other symptoms may be \\nmanaged with replacement doses of a narcotic (oral morphine, \\nmethadone, buprenorphine) to calm the infant; weaning from \\nnarcotics may be prolonged over 1-2 months.\\nCocaine\\nCocaine use during pregnancy is associated with preterm labor, \\nabruptio placentae, neonatal irritability, and decreased attentive-\\nness. Infants may be small for gestational age and have small \\nhead circumferences. Usually no treatment is needed.\\nCHAPTER 59 \\nMaternal Diseases Affecting  \\nthe Newborn\\nMaternal diseases during pregnancy can affect the fetus directly \\nor indirectly (Table 59.1). Autoantibody-mediated diseases can \\nhave direct consequences on the fetus and neonate because the \\nantibodies are usually of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type \\nand can cross the placenta to the fetal circulation.\\nANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME\\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is associated with thrombophilia \\nand recurrent pregnancy loss. Antiphospholipid antibodies are \\nfound in 2-5% of the general healthy population, but they also \\nmay be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \\nand other rheumatic diseases. Obstetric complications arise \\nfrom the prothrombotic effects of the antiphospholipid antibod-\\nies on placental function. Vasculopathy, infarction, and \\nthrombosis have been identified in mothers with antiphospho-\\nlipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid syndrome can include fetal \\ngrowth impairment, placental insufficiency, maternal preeclamp-\\nsia, and premature birth.\\nIDIOPATHIC (IMMUNE) THROMBOCYTOPENIA\\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is seen in approxi-\\nmately 1-2 per 1,000 live births and is an immune process in \\nwhich antibodies are directed against platelets. Platelet-associated \\nIgG antibodies can cross the placenta and cause thrombocyto-\\npenia in the fetus and newborn. The severely thrombocytopenic \\nfetus is at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. ITP during \\npregnancy requires close maternal and fetal management to \\nreduce the risks of life-threatening maternal hemorrhage \\nand trauma to the fetus at delivery. Postnatal management \\ninvolves observation of the infant’s platelet count. For infants \\nparathyroid response to the usual postnatal decline of serum \\ncalcium levels may be responsible for hypocalcemia in pre-\\nmature infants and infants of diabetic mothers. Congenital \\nabsences of the parathyroid gland with DiGeorge syndrome \\nis a cause of hypocalcemia. Hypomagnesemia (<1.5 mg/dL) \\nmay be seen simultaneously with hypocalcemia, especially in \\ninfants of diabetic mothers. Treatment with calcium alone does \\nnot relieve symptoms or increase serum calcium levels until \\nhypomagnesemia is also treated. Sodium bicarbonate therapy, \\nphosphate release from cell necrosis, transient hypoparathy-\\nroidism, and hypercalcitoninemia may be responsible for early \\nneonatal hypocalcemia associated with asphyxia. Early-onset \\nhypocalcemia associated with asphyxia often occurs with seizures \\nas a result of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\\nLate neonatal hypocalcemia, or neonatal tetany, often is \\nthe result of ingestion of high phosphate–containing milk or \\nthe inability to excrete the usual phosphorus in commercial \\ninfant formula. Hyperphosphatemia (>8 m g/dL) usually occurs \\nin infants with hypocalcemia after the first week of life. Vitamin \\nD deficiency states and malabsorption also have been associated \\nwith late-onset hypocalcemia.\\nThe clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia and hypomagne-\\nsemia include apnea, muscle twitching, seizures, laryngospasm, \\nChvostek sign (facial muscle spasm when the side of the \\nface over the seventh nerve is tapped), and Trousseau sign \\n(carpopedal spasm induced by partial inflation of a blood \\npressure cuff). The latter two signs are rare in the immediate \\nnewborn period.\\nNeonatal hypocalcemia may be prevented in high-risk neo-\\nnates by administration of IV or oral calcium supplementation at \\na rate of 25-75 m g/kg/24  hr . Early asymptomatic hypocalcemia \\nof preterm infants and infants of diabetic mothers often resolves \\nspontaneously. Symptomatic hypocalcemia should be treated \\nwith 2-4 mL/kg o f 10% calcium gluconate given intravenously \\nand slowly over 10-15 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion \\nof 75 m g/kg/24  h r of elemental calcium. If hypomagnesemia is \\nassociated with hypocalcemia, 50% magnesium sulfate, 0.1 mL/\\nkg, should be given by intramuscular injection and repeated \\nevery 8-12 hours.\\nThe treatment of late hypocalcemia includes immediate \\nmanagement, as in early hypocalcemia, plus the initiation of \\nfeedings with low-phosphate formula. Subcutaneous infiltration \\nof IV calcium salts can cause tissue necrosis; oral supplements \\nare hypertonic and may irritate the intestinal mucosa.\\nNeonatal Drug Addiction and Withdrawal\\nInfants may become passively and physiologically addicted to \\nmedications or to drugs of abuse (heroin, methadone, barbi-\\nturates, tranquilizers, amphetamines) taken chronically by the \\nmother during pregnancy; these infants subsequently may have \\nsigns and symptoms of drug withdrawal. Many of these pregnan-\\ncies are at high risk for other complications related to IV drug \\nabuse, such as hepatitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \\n(AIDS), and syphilis. In addition, the LBW rate and the long-\\nterm risk for sudden infant death syndrome are higher in the \\ninfants of these high-risk women.\\nOpiates\\nNeonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms usually begin at 1-5 \\ndays of life with maternal heroin use and at 1-4 weeks with \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Severe hypertensive \\nor diabetic vasculopathy can result in uteroplacental insuf-\\nficiency. The fetus and the newborn may also be adversely \\naffected by the medications used to treat maternal illnesses. \\nThese effects may appear as teratogenesis (Table 59.3) or as \\nan adverse metabolic, neurological, or cardiopulmonary \\nadaptation to extrauterine life (Table 59.4). Acquired infectious \\ndiseases of the mother also may affect the fetus or newborn  \\nadversely.\\nDIABETES MELLITUS\\nDiabetes mellitus that develops during pregnancy (gestational \\ndiabetes is noted in about 5% of women) or diabetes that is \\npresent before pregnancy adversely influences fetal and neonatal \\nwell-being. The effect of diabetes on the fetus depends, in part, \\non the severity of the diabetic state: age of onset of diabetes, \\nduration of treatment with insulin, and presence of vascular \\ndisease. Poorly controlled maternal diabetes leads to maternal \\nand fetal hyperglycemia that stimulates the fetal pancreas, \\nresulting in hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans. Fetal \\nhyperinsulinemia results in increased fat and protein synthesis, \\nproducing a fetus that is large for gestational age. After birth, \\nhyperinsulinemia persists, resulting in fasting neonatal \\nhypoglycemia. Strictly controlling maternal diabetes during \\npregnancy and preventing hyperglycemia during labor and \\ndelivery prevent macrosomic fetal growth and neonatal \\nhypoglycemia.

Variation in environ-\\nmental factors rather than the fetal genetics plays a more \\nsignificant role in determining overall fetal well-being, although \\na genetically abnormal fetus may not thrive as well or survive. \\nThe ability to assess a fetus genetically, biochemically, and \\nphysically is greatly enhanced through the development of \\namniocentesis, fetoscopy, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood \\nsampling, genetic testing of circulating fetal DNA in the mother’s \\nblood, and real-time ultrasonography.\\nINTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION AND \\nSMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE\\nFetuses subjected to abnormal maternal, placental, or fetal \\nconditions that restrain growth are a high-risk group and \\ntraditionally classified as having intrauterine growth restriction \\n(IUGR). The terms IUGR and small for gestational age (SGA) \\nare not synonymous. IUGR represents a deviation from expected \\ngrowth patterns. The decreased fetal growth associated with \\nIUGR is an adaptation to unfavorable intrauterine conditions \\nthat result in permanent alterations in metabolism, growth, \\nand development. IUGR most frequently occurs with a variety \\nof maternal conditions that are associated with preterm delivery. \\nSGA describes an infant whose birth weight is statistically less \\nthan the 10th percentile or two standard deviations below the \\nmean birth weight for gestational age. The cause of SGA may \\nbe pathological, as in an infant with IUGR, or nonpathological, \\nas in an infant who is small but otherwise healthy (Table 60.1).\\nOnly about 50% of IUGR infants are identified before \\ndelivery. Measurement and recording of maternal fundal height \\nin conjunction with serial ultrasound assessment of the fetus \\n(growth rate, amniotic fluid volume, malformations, anoma-\\nlies, and Doppler velocimetry of uterine, placental, and fetal \\nblood flow) can aid detection. When suspected and identified, \\nIUGR and SGA fetuses must be monitored for fetal well-being, \\nand appropriate maternal care needs to be instituted (see  \\nChapter 58).\\nAt birth, infants who are mildly to moderately SGA appear \\nsmaller than normal with decreased subcutaneous fat. More \\nseverely affected infants may present with a wasted appearance \\nwith asymmetrical findings, including larger heads for the size \\nof the body (central nervous system sparing), widened anterior \\nfontanelles, small abdomen, thin arms and legs, decreased sub-\\ncutaneous fat, dry and redundant skin, decreased muscle mass, \\nand thin (often meconium-stained) umbilical cord. Gestational \\nage is often difficult to assess when based on physical appear-\\nance and perceived advanced neurological maturity.

Postnatal \\ngrowth and development depend in part on the etiology, the \\npostnatal nutritional intake, and the social environment. Infants \\nwho have IUGR and SGA secondary to congenital infection, \\nchromosomal abnormalities, or constitutional syndromes remain \\nsmall throughout life. Infants who have growth inhibited late in \\ngestation because of uterine constraints, placental insufficiency, \\nor poor nutrition have catch-up growth and, under optimal \\nenvironmental conditions, approach their inherited growth and \\ndevelopment potential.\\nHYDROPS FETALIS\\nHydrops fetalis is caused by immune and nonimmune condi-\\ntions. Hydrops fetalis is a fetal clinical condition of excessive \\nfluid accumulation in the skin and one or more other body \\ncompartments, including the pleural space, peritoneal cavity, \\npericardial sac, or placenta with resultant high morbidity and \\nmortality. Hydrops initially was described in association with \\nRhesus blood group isoimmunization. The use of Rho (D) \\nimmune globulin has reduced the incidence of isoimmune \\nfetal hydrops. Concurrently the incidence of nonimmune \\nhydrops has increased as a cause of this severe clinical  \\ncondition.\\nFetal hydrops results from an imbalance of interstitial fluid \\naccumulation and decreased removal of fluid by the capillaries \\nand lymphatic system. Fluid accumulation can be secondary \\nto congestive heart failure, obstructed lymphatic flow, or \\ndecreased plasma oncotic pressure (hypoproteinemic states). \\nEdema formation is the final common pathway for many \\ndisease processes that affect the fetus, including fetal cardiac, \\ngenetic, hematological, metabolic, infection, or malformation  \\nsyndromes.\\nThe diagnostic work-up of the hydropic fetus should focus \\non discovering the underlying cause. Maternal findings may \\ninclude hypertension, anemia, multiple gestation, thickened \\nplacenta, and polyhydramnios, whereas fetal findings may \\ninclude tachycardia, ascites, scalp and body wall edema, and \\npleural and pericardial effusion. Invasive fetal testing may be \\nindicated. Amniocentesis provides amniotic fluid samples for \\nkaryotype, culture, alpha-fetoprotein, and metabolic and enzyme \\nanalysis. Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling can \\nprovide fetal blood for chromosomal analysis and hematological \\nand metabolic studies and provide a source for intervention \\n(fetal transfusion for profound anemia).\\nManagement depends on the underlying cause and the \\ngestational age of the fetus. Resuscitative efforts at delivery are \\noften required. It is often necessary to remove ascitic fluid from \\nthe abdomen or pleural fluid to improve ventilation. Profound \\nanemia necessitates immediate transfusion with packed red \\nblood cells.\\nThe overall mortality for infants with nonimmune hydrops \\nis approximately 50%. If the diagnosis is made before 24 weeks \\nof gestation with subsequent premature delivery, the survival \\nrate is approximately 4-6%.\\nRespiratory distress that becomes manifested by tachypnea, \\nintercostal retractions, reduced air exchange, cyanosis, expiratory \\ngrunting, and nasal flaring is a nonspecific response to serious \\nillness. The differential diagnosis of respiratory distress includes \\npulmonary, cardiac, hematological, infectious, anatomical, and \\nmetabolic disorders that may involve the lungs directly or \\nindirectly. Surfactant deficiency causes respiratory distress \\nsyndrome (RDS), resulting in cyanosis and tachypnea; infection \\nproduces pneumonia, shown by interstitial or lobar infiltrates; \\nmeconium aspiration results in a chemical pneumonitis with \\nhypoxia and pulmonary hypertension; hydrops fetalis causes \\nanemia and hypoalbuminemia with high-output heart failure \\nand pulmonary edema; and congenital or acquired pulmonary \\nhypoplasia causes pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary \\ninsufficiency. It also is clinically useful to differentiate the \\ncommon causes of respiratory distress according to gestational \\nage (Table 61.1).\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Patients with hypotension \\nproduced by hypovolemia require fluids and may need inotropic \\nor vasoactive drug support. If metabolic acidosis persists despite \\nspecific therapy, sodium bicarbonate (1  mE q/kg/dose) may \\nbe given by slow intravenous infusion. Near-normal or low \\nPCO2 levels should be documented before sodium bicarbonate \\ninfusion. The buffering effect of sodium bicarbonate results in \\nincreased PCO2 levels, unless adequate ventilation is maintained.\\nRespiratory acidosis, defined as an elevated PCO2 level and \\nreduced pH without a reduction in the bicarbonate concen -\\ntration, may be caused by pulmonary insufficiency or central \\nhypoventilation. Most disorders producing respiratory distress \\ncan lead to hypercapnia. Treatment involves assisted ventila-\\ntion but not sodium bicarbonate. If central nervous system \\ndepression of respirations is caused by placental passage of \\nnarcotic analgesics, assisted ventilation is instituted first, then \\nthe central nervous system depression is reversed by naloxone.\\nRESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME \\n(HYALINE MEMBRANE DISEASE)\\nRDS occurs after the onset of breathing and is associated with \\nan insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant.\\nLung Development\\nThe lining of the alveolus consists of 90% type I cells and 10% \\ntype II cells. After 20 weeks of gestation, the type II cells contain \\nvacuolated, osmophilic, lamellar inclusion bodies, which are \\npackages of surface-active material (Fig. 61.1). This lipoprotein \\nsurfactant is 90% lipid and is composed predominantly of \\nsaturated phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), but also contains \\nphosphatidylglycerol, other phospholipids, and neutral lipids. \\nThe surfactant proteins, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D, are pack-\\naged into the lamellar body and contribute to surface-active \\nproperties and recycling of surfactant. Surfactant prevents \\natelectasis by reducing surface tension at low lung volumes \\nwhen it is concentrated at end expiration as the alveolar radius \\ndecreases; surfactant contributes to lung recoil by increasing \\nsurface tension at larger lung volumes when it is diluted during \\ninspiration as the alveolar radius increases. Without surfactant, \\nsurface tension forces are not reduced, and atelectasis develops \\nduring end expiration as the alveolus collapses.\\nThe timing of surfactant production in quantities sufficient \\nto prevent atelectasis depends on an increase in fetal cortisol \\nlevels that begins between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation. By \\n34-36 weeks, sufficient surface-active material is produced by \\nthe type II cells in the lung, is secreted into the alveolar lumen, \\nand is excreted into the amniotic fluid. The concentration of \\nlecithin in amniotic fluid indicates fetal pulmonary maturity. \\nBecause the amount of lecithin is difficult to quantify, the ratio of \\nlecithin (which increases with maturity) to sphingomyelin (which \\nremains constant during gestation; L/S ratio) is determined. \\nAn L/S ratio of 2 :  1 u sually indicates pulmonary maturity. The \\npresence of minor phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol, \\nalso is indicative of fetal lung maturity and may be useful in \\nsituations in which the L/S ratio is borderline or possibly \\naffected by maternal diabetes, which reduces lung maturity. \\nThe absence of phosphatidylglycerol suggests that surfactant \\nmight not be mature.\\nIn addition to the specific therapy for the individual disorder, \\nsupportive care and evaluation of the infant with respiratory \\ndistress can be applied to all the problems mentioned earlier \\n(Table 61.2). Blood gas monitoring and interpretation are key \\ncomponents of general respiratory care.\\nTreatment of hypoxemia requires knowledge of normal \\nvalues. In term infants, the arterial Pa O2 level is 55-60  mm \\nHg at 30 minutes of life, 75  mm H g at 4 hours, and 90  mm \\nHg at 24 hours. Preterm infants have lower values. PaCO2 levels \\nshould be 35-40  mm H g, and the pH should be 7.35-7.40. It \\nis imperative that arterial blood gas analysis be performed in \\nall infants with significant respiratory distress, whether or not \\ncyanosis is perceived. Cyanosis becomes evident when there is \\n5 g  of unsaturated hemoglobin; anemia may interfere with the \\nperception of cyanosis. Jaundice also may interfere with the \\nappearance of cyanosis. Capillary blood gas determinations are \\nuseful in determining blood pH and the PaCO2 level but may \\nresult in falsely low blood PaO2 readings. Serial blood gas levels \\nmay be monitored by an indwelling arterial catheter placed in \\na peripheral artery or through the umbilical artery. Another \\nmethod for monitoring blood gas levels is to combine capillary \\nblood gas techniques with noninvasive methods used to monitor \\noxygen (pulse oximetry or transcutaneous oxygen diffusion).\\nMetabolic acidosis, defined as a reduced pH (<7.25) and \\nbicarbonate concentration ( <18 mE q/L) accompanied by \\na normal or low Pa CO2 level, may be caused by hypoxia or \\nby insufficient tissue perfusion. The origin of the disorder \\nmay be pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, renal, hematological, \\nnutritional, metabolic, or iatrogenic. The initial approach to \\nmetabolic acidosis is to determine the cause and treat the \\npathophysiological problem.

A cycle of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis \\nacts on type II cells to reduce surfactant synthesis and, in some \\ninfants, on the pulmonary arterioles to produce pulmonary  \\nhypertension.\\nInfants at greatest risk for RDS are premature and have \\nan immature L/S ratio. The incidence of RDS increases with \\ndecreasing gestational age. RDS develops in 30-60% of infants \\nbetween 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. Other risk factors include \\ndelivery of a previous preterm infant with RDS, maternal \\ndiabetes, hypothermia, fetal distress, asphyxia, male sex, white \\nrace, being the second-born of twins, and delivery by cesarean \\nsection without labor.\\nRDS may develop immediately in the delivery room in \\nextremely immature infants at 26-30 weeks of gestation. Some \\nmore mature infants (34 weeks’ gestation) may not show signs of \\nRDS until 3-4 hours after birth, correlating with the initial release \\nof stored surfactant at the onset of breathing accompanied by the \\nongoing inability to replace the surfactant owing to inadequate \\nstores. Manifestations of RDS include cyanosis, tachypnea, \\nnasal flaring, intercostal and sternal retractions, and grunting. \\nGrunting is caused by closure of the glottis during expiration, \\nthe effect of which is to maintain lung volume (decreasing \\natelectasis) and gas exchange during exhalation. Atelectasis is \\nwell documented by radiographic examination of the chest, \\nwhich shows a ground-glass haze in the lung surrounding \\nair-filled bronchi (the air bronchogram; Fig. 61.2). Severe RDS \\nmay show an airless lung field (whiteout) on a radiograph, \\neven obliterating the distinction between the atelectatic lungs \\nand the heart.\\nDuring the first 72 hours, infants with untreated RDS have \\nincreasing distress and hypoxemia. In infants with severe RDS, \\nthe development of edema, apnea, and respiratory failure neces-\\nsitates assisted ventilation. Thereafter, uncomplicated cases show \\na spontaneous improvement that often is heralded by diuresis \\nand a marked resolution of edema. Complications include the \\ndevelopment of a pneumothorax, a patent ductus arteriosus \\n(PDA), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The differential \\ndiagnosis of RDS includes diseases associated with cyanosis \\nand respiratory distress (see Table 58.10).\\nPrevention and Treatment\\nStrategies to prevent preterm birth include maternal cervical \\ncerclage, bed rest, treatment of infections, and administration \\nof tocolytic medications. In addition, prevention of neonatal \\ncold stress, birth asphyxia, and hypovolemia reduces the risk \\nof RDS. If premature delivery is unavoidable, the antenatal \\nadministration of corticosteroids (e.g., betamethasone) to the \\nmother (and thus to the fetus) stimulates fetal lung production \\nof surfactant; this approach requires multiple doses for at least \\n48 hours.\\nAfter birth, RDS may be prevented or its severity reduced \\nby intratracheal administration of exogenous surfactant imme-\\ndiately after birth in the delivery room or within a few hours \\nof birth. Exogenous surfactant can be administered repeatedly \\nduring the course of RDS in patients receiving endotracheal \\nintubation, mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy. Early \\napplication of nasal CPAP may also reduce the severity of RDS. \\nAdditional management includes the general supportive and \\nventilation care presented in Table 61.3.\\nAir\\nWater\\nMLB LMF\\nMLB\\nMVB\\nSLB\\nGZ\\nER\\nN\\nFIGURE 61.1 Proposed pathway of synthesis, transport, secretion, \\nand reuptake of surfactant in the type II alveolar cell.

Oxygen concentrations greater than \\n40% are toxic to the neonatal lung. Oxygen-mediated lung \\ninjury results from the generation of superoxides, hydrogen \\nperoxide, and oxygen free radicals, which disrupt membrane \\nlipids. Assisted ventilation with high peak pressures produces \\nbarotrauma, compounding the damaging effects of highly \\ninspired oxygen levels. In most patients, BPD develops after \\nventilation for RDS that may have been complicated by PDA \\nor pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Inflammation from \\nprolonged assisted ventilation and repeated systemic and \\npulmonary infections may play a major role. Failure of RDS \\nto improve after 2 weeks, the need for prolonged mechanical \\nventilation, and oxygen therapy required at 36 weeks’ postcon-\\nceptual age are characteristic of patients with RDS in whom \\nBPD develops. BPD also may develop in infants weighing \\nless than 1,000 g who require mechanical ventilation for poor \\nrespiratory drive in the absence of RDS. Fifty percent of infants \\nof 24-26 weeks’ gestational age require oxygen at 36 weeks’  \\ncorrected age.\\nThe radiographic appearance of BPD is characterized \\ninitially by lung opacification and subsequently by development \\nof cysts accompanied by areas of overdistention and atelectasis, \\ngiving the lung a spongelike appearance. The histopathology of \\nBPD reveals interstitial edema, atelectasis, mucosal metaplasia, \\ninterstitial fibrosis, necrotizing obliterative bronchiolitis, and \\noverdistended alveoli.\\nThe clinical manifestations of BPD are oxygen depen -\\ndence, hypercapnia with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, \\npulmonary hypertension, poor growth, and development of \\nright-sided heart failure. Increased airway resistance with reac-\\ntive airway bronchoconstriction also is noted and is treated \\nwith bronchodilating agents. Severe chest retractions produce \\nnegative interstitial pressure that draws fluid into the interstitial \\nspace. Together with cor pulmonale, these chest retractions \\nsystemic-to-pulmonary shunting may lead to heart failure and \\npulmonary edema. Excessive intravenous fluid administration \\nmay increase the incidence of symptomatic PDA. The infant’s \\nrespiratory status deteriorates because of increased lung fluid, \\nhypercapnia, and hypoxemia.\\nClinical manifestations of a PDA usually become apparent \\non day 2-4 of life. Because the left-to-right shunt directs flow \\nto a low-pressure circulation from one of high pressure, the \\npulse pressure widens; a previously inactive precordium shows \\nan extremely active precordial impulse, and peripheral pulses \\nbecome easily palpable and bounding. The murmur of a PDA \\nmay be continuous in systole and diastole, but usually only the \\nsystolic component is auscultated. Heart failure and pulmonary \\nedema result in rales and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph \\nshows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema; a two-dimensional \\nechocardiogram shows ductal patency; and Doppler studies \\nshow markedly increased left-to-right flow through the ductus.\\nTreatment of a PDA during RDS involves initial fluid \\nrestriction and diuretic administration. If there is no improve-\\nment after 24-48 hours, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, \\nindomethacin or ibuprofen, is administered. Contraindications \\nto using indomethacin include thrombocytopenia (platelets \\n<50,000/mm3), bleeding, serum creatinine measuring more \\nthan 1.8 m g/dL, and oliguria. Because 20-30% of infants do \\nnot respond initially to indomethacin and because the PDA \\nreopens in 10-20% of infants, a repeat course of indomethacin \\nor surgical ligation is required in some patients.\\nPulmonary Air Leaks\\nAssisted ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures and \\npositive end-expiratory pressures may cause overdistention of \\nalveoli in localized areas of the lung. Rupture of the alveolar \\nepithelial lining may produce pulmonary interstitial emphysema \\nas gas dissects along the interstitial space and the peribronchial \\nlymphatics. Extravasation of gas into the parenchyma reduces \\nlung compliance and worsens respiratory failure. Gas dissection \\ninto the mediastinal space produces a pneumomediastinum, \\noccasionally dissecting into the subcutaneous tissues around \\nthe neck, causing subcutaneous emphysema.\\nAlveolar rupture adjacent to the pleural space produces a \\npneumothorax (Fig. 61.3). If the gas is under tension, the \\npneumothorax shifts the mediastinum to the opposite side of \\nthe chest, producing hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. \\nThe diagnosis of a pneumothorax may be based on unequal \\ntransillumination of the chest and may be confirmed by chest \\nradiograph.

Although the passage of \\nmeconium into amniotic fluid is common in infants born in \\nthe breech presentation, meconium-stained fluid should be \\nconsidered clinically as a sign of fetal distress in all infants. \\nThe presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid suggests in \\nutero distress with asphyxia, hypoxia, and acidosis.\\nAspiration of amniotic fluid contaminated with particulate \\nmeconium may occur in utero in a distressed, gasping fetus; \\nmore often, meconium is aspirated into the lung immediately \\nafter delivery. Affected infants have abnormal chest radiographs, \\nshowing a high incidence of pneumonia and pneumothoraces.\\nMeconium aspiration pneumonia  is characterized by \\ntachypnea, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and small airway obstruction \\ncausing a ball-valve effect, leading to air trapping, overdistention, \\nand extra-alveolar air leaks. Complete small-airway obstruction \\nproduces atelectasis. Within 24-48 hours, a chemical pneumo-\\nnitis develops in addition to the mechanical effects of airway \\nobstruction. Abnormal pulmonary function may be caused \\nby the meconium, in part, through inactivation of surfactant. \\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) \\nfrequently accompanies meconium aspiration, with right-to-left \\nshunting caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance. \\nThe chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates, overdisten-\\ntion, flattening of the diaphragm, increased anteroposterior \\ndiameter, and a high incidence of pneumomediastinum and \\npneumothoraces. Comorbid diseases include those associated \\nwith in utero asphyxia that initiated the passage of meconium.\\nTreatment of meconium aspiration includes general sup -\\nportive care and assisted ventilation. Infants with a PPHN-like \\npresentation should be treated for PPHN. If severe hypoxia does \\nnot subside with conventional or high-frequency ventilation, \\nsurfactant therapy, and inhaled nitric oxide, extracorporeal \\nmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be beneficial.\\nPrevention of meconium aspiration syndrome involves careful \\nin utero monitoring to prevent asphyxia. When meconium-\\nstained fluid is observed, the obstetrician should suction the \\ninfant’s oropharynx before delivering the rest of the infant’s \\nbody. If the infant is depressed with poor tone, minimal \\nrespiratory effort, and cyanosis, the infant’s oropharynx should \\ncause fluid retention, necessitating fluid restriction and the \\nadministration of diuretics.\\nPatients with severe BPD may need treatment with mechani-\\ncal ventilation for many months. To reduce the risk of subglottic \\nstenosis, a tracheotomy may be indicated. To reduce oxygen \\ntoxicity and barotrauma, ventilator settings are reduced to \\nmaintain blood gases with slightly lower PaO2 (50  mm Hg) \\nand higher PaCO2 (50-75 mm H g) levels than for infants during \\nthe acute phase of RDS. Dexamethasone therapy may reduce \\ninflammation, improve pulmonary function, and enhance \\nweaning of patients from assisted ventilation. However, dexa-\\nmethasone may increase the risk of cerebral palsy or abnormal \\nneuromotor developmental outcome. Older survivors of BPD \\nhave hyperinflation, reactive airways, and developmental delay. \\nThey are at risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia \\nand as infants should receive prophylaxis against respiratory \\nsyncytial virus.\\nRetinopathy of Prematurity  \\n(Retrolental Fibroplasia)\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nVisual Impairment and Leukocoria\\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is caused by the acute and \\nchronic effects of oxygen toxicity on the developing blood \\nvessels of the premature infant’s retina. The completely vascular-\\nized retina of the term infant is not susceptible to ROP . ROP \\nis a leading cause of blindness in very low birth weight infants \\n(<1,500 g). Excessive arterial oxygen tensions produce vasocon-\\nstriction of immature retinal vasculature in the first stage of this \\ndisease. Vaso-obliteration follows if the duration and extent of \\nhyperoxia are prolonged beyond the time when vasoconstric-\\ntion is reversible. Hypercarbia and hypoxia may contribute to \\nROP . The subsequent proliferative stages are characterized by \\nextraretinal fibrovascular proliferation, forming a ridge between \\nthe vascular and avascular portions of the retina, and by the \\ndevelopment of neovascular tufts. In mild cases, vasoprolifera-\\ntion is noted at the periphery of the retina. Severe cases may \\nhave neovascularization involving the entire retina, retinal \\ndetachment resulting from traction on vessels as they leave \\nthe optic disc, fibrous proliferation behind the lens producing \\nleukokoria, and synechiae displacing the lens forward, leading \\nto glaucoma. Both eyes usually are involved, but severity may be  \\nasymmetrical.\\nThe incidence of ROP may be reduced by careful monitoring \\nof arterial blood gas levels in all patients receiving oxygen. \\nAlthough there is no absolutely safe PaO2 level, it is wise to \\nkeep the arterial oxygen level between 50 and 70  mm H g in \\npremature infants. Infants who weigh less than 1,500 g o r who \\nare born before 28 weeks’ gestational age (some authors say \\n32 weeks) should be screened when they are 4 weeks of age or \\nmore than 34 weeks’ corrected gestational age, whichever comes \\nfirst. Laser therapy or (less often) cryotherapy may be used for \\nvitreous hemorrhage or for severe, progressive vasoproliferation. \\nSurgery is indicated for retinal detachment. Less severe stages \\nof ROP resolve spontaneously and without visual impairment \\nin most patients.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

PPHN \\nis characterized by severe hypoxemia, without evidence of \\nparenchymal lung or structural heart disease. PPHN is often \\nseen with asphyxia or meconium-stained fluid. The chest \\nradiograph usually reveals normal lung fields rather than the \\nexpected infiltrates and hyperinflation that may accompany \\nmeconium aspiration. Additional problems that may lead to \\nPPHN are congenital pneumonia, hyperviscosity-polycythemia, \\ncongenital diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary hypoplasia, \\ncongenital cyanotic heart disease, hypoglycemia, and hypo-\\nthermia. Total anomalous venous return associated with \\nobstruction of blood flow may produce a clinical picture that \\ninvolves severe hypoxia and that is initially indistinguishable \\nfrom PPHN; however, a chest radiograph reveals severe pul-\\nmonary venous engorgement and a small heart. Echocardiog-\\nraphy or cardiac catheterization confirms the diagnosis.\\nSignificant right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen \\novale, through a PDA, and through intrapulmonary channels \\nis characteristic of PPHN. The pulmonary vasculature often \\nshows hypertrophied arterial wall smooth muscle, suggesting \\nthat the process of or predisposition to PPHN began in utero \\nas a result of previous periods of fetal hypoxia. After birth, \\nhypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis exacerbate pulmonary artery \\nvasoconstriction, leading to further hypoxia and acidosis. Some \\ninfants with PPHN have extrapulmonary manifestations as a \\nresult of asphyxia. Myocardial injuries include heart failure, \\ntransient mitral insufficiency, and papillary muscle or myocar-\\ndial infarction. Thrombocytopenia, right atrial thrombi, and \\npulmonary embolism also may be noted.\\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiographic examina-\\ntion, which shows elevated pulmonary artery pressures and \\nsites of right-to-left shunting. Echocardiography also rules out \\nstructural congenital heart disease and transient myocardial \\ndysfunction.\\nTreatment involves general supportive care; correction of \\nhypotension, anemia, and acidosis; and management of compli-\\ncations associated with asphyxia. If myocardial dysfunction is \\npresent, dopamine or dobutamine is needed. The most important \\ntherapy for PPHN is assisted ventilation. Reversible mild pul-\\nmonary hypertension may respond to conventional assisted \\nventilation. Patients with severe PPHN do not always respond \\nto conventional therapy.

A thorough consideration of possible \\ncauses is always warranted, especially with the onset or unex-\\npected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea (or \\nbradycardia).\\nApnea is defined as the cessation of pulmonary airflow for \\na specific time interval, usually longer than 10-20 seconds. \\nBradycardia often accompanies prolonged apnea. Central apnea \\nrefers to a complete cessation of airflow and respiratory efforts \\nwith no chest wall movement. Obstructive apnea refers to the \\nabsence of noticeable airflow but with the continuation of chest \\nwall movements. Mixed apnea, a combination of these two \\nevents, is the most frequent type. It may begin as a brief episode \\nof obstruction followed by a central apnea. Alternatively, central \\napnea may produce upper airway closure (passive pharyngeal \\nhypotonia), resulting in mixed apnea.\\nA careful evaluation to determine the cause of apnea should \\nbe performed immediately in any infant with apnea. The inci-\\ndence of apnea increases as gestational age decreases. Idiopathic \\napnea, a disease of premature infants, appears in the absence \\nof any other identifiable disease states during the first week \\nof life and usually resolves by 36-40 weeks of postconceptual \\nage (gestational age at birth + postnatal age). The premature \\ninfant’s process of regulating respiration is especially vulnerable \\nto apnea. Preterm infants respond paradoxically to hypoxia \\nby developing apnea rather than by increasing respirations \\nas in mature infants. Poor tone of the laryngeal muscles also \\nmay lead to collapse of the upper airway, causing obstruction. \\nIsolated obstructive apnea also may occur as a result of flexion \\nor extreme lateral positioning of the premature infant’s head, \\nwhich obstructs the soft trachea.\\nTreatment of apnea of prematurity involves administration \\nof oxygen to hypoxic infants, transfusion of anemic infants, and \\nphysical cutaneous stimulation for infants with mild apnea. \\nMethylxanthines (caffeine or theophylline) are the mainstay \\nof pharmacological treatment of apnea. Xanthine therapy \\nincreases minute ventilation, improves the carbon dioxide \\nsensitivity, decreases hypoxic depression of breathing, enhances \\ndiaphragmatic activity, and decreases periodic breathing. \\nTreatment usually is initiated with a loading dose followed \\nby maintenance therapy. High-flow nasal cannula therapy and \\nnasal CPAP of 4-6 cm H2O also are effective and relatively safe \\nmethods of treating obstructive or mixed apneas; they may work \\nby stimulating the infant and splinting the upper airway. CPAP \\nalso probably increases functional residual capacity, improving \\noxygenation.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

These IgG antibodies \\ncross the placenta by active transport and affect the fetus or \\nnewborn. Sensitization of the mother to fetal antigens may \\nhave occurred by previous transfusions or by conditions of \\npregnancy that result in transfer of fetal erythrocytes into \\nthe maternal circulation, such as first-trimester abortion, \\nectopic pregnancy, amniocentesis, manual extraction of the \\nplacenta, version (external or internal) procedures, or normal  \\npregnancy.\\nABO incompatibility with sensitization usually does not \\ncause fetal disease other than extremely mild anemia. It may \\nproduce hemolytic disease of the newborn , which is mani-\\nfested as significant anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Because \\nmany mothers who have blood group O have IgG antibodies \\nto A and B before pregnancy, the firstborn infant of A or B \\nblood type may be affected. In contrast to Rh disease, ABO \\nhemolytic disease does not become more severe with subsequent \\npregnancies. Hemolysis with ABO incompatibility is less severe \\nthan hemolysis in Rh-sensitized pregnancy, either because the \\nanti-A or anti-B antibody may bind to nonerythrocytic cells \\nthat contain A or B antigen or because fetal erythrocytes have \\nfewer A or B antigenic determinants than they have Rh sites. \\nWith the declining incidence of Rh hemolytic disease, ABO \\nincompatibility has become the most common cause of neonatal \\nhyperbilirubinemia requiring therapy, currently accounting \\nfor approximately 20% of clinically significant jaundice in the \\nnewborn.\\nErythroblastosis fetalis classically is caused by Rh blood \\ngroup incompatibility. Most Rh-negative women have no anti-Rh \\nantibodies at the time of their first pregnancy. The Rh antigen \\nsystem consists of five antigens: C, D, E, c, and e; the d type \\nis not antigenic. In most Rh-sensitized cases, the D antigen of \\nthe fetus sensitizes the Rh-negative (d) mother, resulting in \\nIgG antibody production during the first pregnancy.

In midgestation, \\nerythropoiesis occurs in the liver and spleen; the bone marrow \\nbecomes the predominant site in the last trimester. Hemoglobin \\nconcentration increases from 8-10 g/dL a t 12 weeks to 16.5-18  g/\\ndL at 40 weeks. Fetal red blood cell (RBC) production is \\nresponsive to erythropoietin; the concentration of this hormone \\nincreases with fetal hypoxia and anemia.\\nAfter birth, hemoglobin levels increase transiently at 6-12 \\nhours, then decline to 11-12 g/dL a t 3-6 months. A premature \\ninfant (<32 weeks’ gestational age) has a lower hemoglobin \\nconcentration and a more rapid postnatal decline of hemoglobin \\nlevel, which achieves a nadir 1-2 months after birth. Fetal and \\nneonatal RBCs have a shorter life span (70-90 days) and a \\nhigher mean corpuscular volume (110-120 fL) t han adult cells. \\nIn the fetus, hemoglobin synthesis in the last two trimesters of \\npregnancy produces fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F), composed \\nof two alpha chains and two gamma chains. Immediately before \\nterm, the infant begins to synthesize beta-hemoglobin chains; \\nthe term infant should have some adult hemoglobin (two alpha \\nchains and two beta chains). Fetal hemoglobin represents 60-90% \\nof hemoglobin at term birth. The levels decline to adult levels \\nof less than 5% by 4 months of age.\\nFor a term infant, blood volume is 72-93  mL/kg , and for a \\npreterm infant, blood volume is 90-100  mL/kg . The placenta \\nand umbilical vessels contain approximately 20-30  mL/kg o f \\nadditional blood that can increase neonatal blood volume and \\nhemoglobin levels transiently for the first 3 days of life if clamp-\\ning or milking (stripping) of the umbilical cord is delayed at birth. \\nDelayed clamping usually has no adverse effects but may increase \\nthe risk of polycythemia and jaundice.

This higher level may be partly a result of \\nthe decreased fluid intake of infants fed breast milk. Jaundice \\nis unphysiological or pathological if it is clinically evident on \\nthe first day of life, if the bilirubin level increases more than \\n0.5 m g/dL/hr, if the peak bilirubin is greater than 13  m g/dL \\nin term infants, if the direct bilirubin fraction is greater than \\n1.5 m g/dL, or if hepatosplenomegaly and anemia are present.\\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome is a serious, rare, autosomal \\nrecessive, permanent deficiency of glucuronosyltransferase that \\nresults in severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Type II responds \\nto enzyme induction by phenobarbital, producing an increase \\nin enzyme activity and a reduction of bilirubin levels. Type I \\ndoes not respond to phenobarbital and manifests as persistent \\nindirect hyperbilirubinemia, often leading to kernicterus. Gilbert \\ndisease is caused by a mutation of the promoter region of \\nglucuronosyltransferase and results in a mild indirect hyper-\\nbilirubinemia. In the presence of another icterogenic factor \\n(hemolysis), more severe jaundice may develop.\\nBreast milk jaundice may be associated with unconjugated \\nhyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hemolysis during the \\nfirst to second week of life. Bilirubin levels rarely increase to \\nmore than 20  m g/dL. Interruption of breast feeding for 1-2 \\ndays results in a rapid decline of bilirubin levels, which do \\nnot increase significantly after breast feeding resumes. Breast \\nmilk may contain an inhibitor of bilirubin conjugation or may \\nincrease enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin because of breast \\nmilk glucuronidase.\\nJaundice on the first day of life is always pathological, and \\nimmediate attention is needed to establish the cause. Early onset \\noften is a result of hemolysis, internal hemorrhage (cephalhe-\\nmatoma, hepatic or splenic hematoma), or infection (Table \\n62.1). Infection also is often associated with direct-reacting \\nbilirubin resulting from perinatal congenital infections or from \\nbacterial sepsis.\\nPhysical evidence of jaundice is observed in infants when \\nbilirubin levels reach 5-10 m g/dL (versus 2-3  m g/dL in adults). \\nWhen jaundice is observed, the laboratory evaluation for hyper-\\nbilirubinemia should include a total bilirubin measurement \\nto determine the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin \\nlevels greater than 5  m g/dL on the first day of life or greater \\nthan 13 m g/dL thereafter in term infants should be evaluated \\nfurther with measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin \\nlevels, blood typing, Coombs test, complete blood count, blood \\nsmear, and reticulocyte count. These tests must be performed \\nbefore treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy or \\nexchange transfusion. In the absence of hemolysis or evidence \\nBiliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. One \\ngram of hemoglobin produces 35  m g of bilirubin. Sources of \\nbilirubin other than circulating hemoglobin represent 20% of \\nbilirubin production; these sources include inefficient (shunt) \\nhemoglobin production and lysis of precursor cells in bone \\nmarrow. Compared with adults, newborns have a twofold to \\nthreefold greater rate of bilirubin production (6-10 m g/kg/24  hr  \\nvs. 3  m g/kg/24  hr). Thi s increased production is caused, in \\npart, by an increased RBC mass (higher hematocrit) and a \\nshortened erythrocyte life span of 70-90 days compared with \\nthe 120-day erythrocyte life span in adults.\\nBilirubin produced after hemoglobin catabolism is lipid \\nsoluble and unconjugated and reacts as an indirect reagent in \\nthe van den Bergh test. Indirect-reacting, unconjugated bilirubin \\nis toxic to the central nervous system and is insoluble in water, \\nlimiting its excretion. Unconjugated bilirubin binds to albumin \\non specific bilirubin binding sites; 1 g o f albumin binds 8.5  m g \\nof bilirubin in a newborn. If the binding sites become saturated \\nor if a competitive compound binds at the site, displacing bound \\nbilirubin, free bilirubin becomes available to enter the central \\nnervous system. Organic acids such as free fatty acids and drugs \\nsuch as sulfisoxazole can displace bilirubin from its binding \\nsite on albumin.\\nBilirubin dissociates from albumin at the hepatocyte and \\nbecomes bound to a cytoplasmic liver protein Y (ligandin). \\nHepatic conjugation results in the production of bilirubin \\ndiglucuronide, which is water soluble and capable of biliary \\nand renal excretion. The enzyme glucuronosyltransferase \\nrepresents the rate-limiting step of bilirubin conjugation. The \\nconcentrations of ligandin and glucuronosyltransferase are \\nlower in newborns, particularly in premature infants, than in \\nolder children.\\nConjugated bilirubin gives a direct reaction in the van den \\nBergh test. Most conjugated bilirubin is excreted through the \\nbile into the small intestine and eliminated in the stool. Some \\nbilirubin may undergo hydrolysis back to the unconjugated \\nfraction by intestinal glucuronidase, however, and may be \\nreabsorbed (enterohepatic recirculation). In addition, bacteria \\nin the neonatal intestine convert bilirubin to urobilinogen \\nand stercobilinogen, which are excreted in urine and stool \\nand usually limit bilirubin reabsorption. Delayed passage of \\nmeconium, which contains bilirubin, also may contribute to \\nthe enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin.\\nBilirubin is produced in utero by the normal fetus and by the \\nfetus affected by erythroblastosis fetalis. Indirect, unconjugated, \\nlipid-soluble fetal bilirubin is transferred across the placenta \\nand becomes conjugated by maternal hepatic enzymes. The \\nplacenta is impermeable to conjugated water-soluble bilirubin. \\nFetal bilirubin levels become only mildly elevated in the presence \\nof severe hemolysis, but may increase when hemolysis produces \\nfetal hepatic inspissated bile stasis and conjugated hyperbiliru-\\nbinemia.

As the hematocrit \\nincreases from 40% to 60%, there is a small increase in blood \\nviscosity. When the central hematocrit increases to greater than \\n65%, the blood viscosity begins to increase markedly, and \\nsymptoms may appear. Neonatal erythrocytes are less filterable \\nor deformable than adult erythrocytes, which further contributes \\nto hyperviscosity. A central venous hematocrit of 65% or greater \\nis noted in 3-5% of infants. Infants at special risk for polycy -\\nthemia are term and post-term small for gestational age infants, \\ninfants of diabetic mothers, infants with delayed cord clamping, \\nand infants with neonatal hyperthyroidism, adrenogenital \\nsyndrome, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, trisomy 21, twin-to-twin \\ntransfusion syndrome (recipient), or Beckwith-Wiedemann \\nsyndrome. In some infants, polycythemia may reflect a com -\\npensation for prolonged periods of fetal hypoxia caused by \\nplacental insufficiency; these infants have increased erythro -\\npoietin levels at birth.\\nPolycythemic patients appear plethoric or ruddy and may \\ndevelop acrocyanosis. Symptoms are a result of the increased \\nRBC mass and of vascular compromise. Seizures, lethargy, \\nand irritability reflect abnormalities of microcirculation of \\nthe brain, whereas hyperbilirubinemia may reflect the poor \\nhepatic circulation or the increased amount of hemoglobin \\nthat is being broken down into bilirubin. Additional problems \\ninclude respiratory distress and primary pulmonary hyperten-\\nsion of the newborn (PPHN) that result in part from elevated \\npulmonary vascular resistance. The chest radiograph often \\nreveals cardiomegaly, increased vascular markings, pleural \\neffusions, and interstitial edema. Other problems are NEC, \\nhypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, priapism, testicular infarc-\\ntion, hemiplegic stroke, and feeding intolerance. Many of \\nthese complications also are related to the primary condition \\nassociated with polycythemia (small for gestational age infants \\nare at risk for hypoglycemia and PPHN after periods of hypoxia  \\nin utero).\\nLong-term sequelae of neonatal polycythemia relate to \\nneurodevelopmental abnormalities that may be prevented by \\ntreatment of symptomatic infants with partial exchange transfu-\\nsion after birth. A partial exchange transfusion removes whole \\nblood and replaces it with normal saline.\\nCoagulation Disorders\\nDisorders of coagulation are common in the neonatal period. \\nHemorrhage during this time may be a result of trauma, \\ninherited permanent deficiency of coagulation factors, transient \\ndeficiencies of vitamin K–dependent factors, disorders of \\nplatelets, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) \\nseen in sick newborns with shock or hypoxia. Thrombosis also \\nis a potential problem in the newborn because of developmen-\\ntally lower circulating levels of antithrombin III, protein C (a \\nvitamin K–dependent protein that inhibits factors VIII and \\nV), and the fibrinolytic system.\\nCoagulation factors do not pass through the placenta to \\nthe fetus, and newborn infants have relatively low levels of \\nthe vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X. Contact \\nfactors XI and XII, prekallikrein, and kininogen also are lower \\nin newborns than in adults. Fibrinogen (factor I); plasma levels \\nTherapy of Indirect Hyperbilirubinemia\\nPhototherapy is an effective and safe method for reducing \\nindirect bilirubin levels, particularly when initiated before serum \\nbilirubin increases to levels associated with kernicterus. In term \\ninfants, phototherapy is begun when indirect bilirubin levels \\nare between 16 and 18 mg/dL. Phototherapy is initiated in \\npremature infants when bilirubin is at lower levels, to prevent \\nbilirubin from reaching the high concentrations necessitating \\nexchange transfusion. Blue lights and white lights are effective \\nin reducing bilirubin levels.\\nUnder the effects of phototherapy light with maximal \\nirradiance in the 425- to 475-nm wavelength band, bilirubin \\nis transformed into isomers that are water soluble and easily \\nexcreted. Unconjugated bilirubin (IX) is in the 4Z, 15Z configura-\\ntion. Phototherapy causes a photochemical reaction producing \\nthe reversible, more water-soluble isomer 4Z, 15E bilirubin \\nIX. This isomer can be excreted easily, bypassing the liver’s \\nconjugation system. Another photochemical reaction results in \\nthe rapid production of lumirubin, a more water-soluble isomer \\nthan the aforementioned isomer, which does not spontaneously \\nrevert to unconjugated native bilirubin and can be excreted  \\nin urine.\\nComplications of phototherapy include an increased insen-\\nsible water loss, diarrhea, and dehydration. Additional problems \\nare macular-papular red skin rash, lethargy, masking of cyanosis, \\nnasal obstruction by eye pads, and potential for retinal damage. \\nSkin bronzing may be noted in infants with direct-reacting \\nhyperbilirubinemia. Infants with mild hemolytic disease of \\nthe newborn occasionally may be managed successfully with \\nphototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, but care must be taken \\nto follow these infants for the late occurrence of anemia from \\ncontinued hemolysis.\\nExchange transfusion usually is reserved for infants with \\ndangerously high indirect bilirubin levels who are at risk \\nfor kernicterus. As a rule of thumb, a level of 20 mg/dL for \\nindirect-reacting bilirubin is the exchange number for infants \\nwith hemolysis who weigh more than 2,000 g. Asymptomatic \\ninfants with physiological or breast milk jaundice may not \\nrequire exchange transfusion, unless the indirect bilirubin level \\nexceeds 25 mg/dL. The exchangeable level of indirect bilirubin \\nfor other infants may be estimated by calculating 10% of the birth \\nweight in grams: the level in an infant weighing 1,500 g would \\nbe 15 mg/dL. Infants weighing less than 1,000 g usually do not \\nrequire an exchange transfusion until the bilirubin level exceeds  \\n10 mg/dL.\\nThe exchange transfusion usually is performed through an \\numbilical venous catheter placed in the inferior vena cava or, \\nif free flow is obtained, at the confluence of the umbilical vein \\nand the portal system. The level of serum bilirubin immediately \\nafter the exchange transfusion declines to levels that are about \\nhalf of those before the exchange; levels rebound 6-8 hours \\nlater as a result of continued hemolysis and redistribution of \\nbilirubin from tissue stores.\\nComplications of exchange transfusion include prob -\\nlems related to the blood (transfusion reaction, metabolic \\ninstability, or infection), the catheter (vessel perforation or \\nhemorrhage), or the procedure (hypotension or necrotizing \\nenterocolitis [NEC]). Unusual complications include throm -\\nbocytopenia and graft-versus-host disease. Continuation of \\nphototherapy may reduce the necessity for subsequent exchange  \\ntransfusions.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Preterm infants \\nhave the most marked prolongation of the PTT (50-80 seconds) \\ncompared with term infants (35-50 seconds) and older, more \\nmature infants (25-35 seconds). The administration of heparin \\nand the presence of DIC, hemophilia, and severe vitamin K \\ndeficiency prolong the PTT.\\nThe prothrombin time (PT), which is dependent on factors \\nX, VII, V , II, and I, is a more sensitive test for vitamin K defi-\\nciency. The PT is only slightly prolonged in term infants (13-20 \\nseconds) compared with preterm infants (13-21 seconds) and \\nmore mature patients (12-14 seconds). Abnormal prolongations \\nof the PT occur with vitamin K deficiency, hepatic injury, and \\nDIC. Levels of fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products  are \\nsimilar in infants and adults. The bleeding time, which reflects \\nplatelet function and number, is normal during the newborn \\nperiod in the absence of maternal salicylate therapy.\\nVitamin K is a necessary cofactor for the carboxylation of \\nglutamate on precursor proteins, converting them into the more \\nactive coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X; γ-carboxyglutamic \\nacid binds calcium, which is required for the immediate acti -\\nvation of factors during hemorrhage. There is no congenital \\ndeficiency of hepatic synthesis of these precursor proteins, but \\nin the absence of vitamin K, their conversion to the active \\nfactor is not possible. Levels of protein induced by vitamin \\nK absence  increase in vitamin K deficiency and are helpful \\ndiagnostic markers; vitamin K administration rapidly corrects \\nthe coagulation defects, reducing protein induced by vitamin \\nK absence to undetectable levels.\\nAlthough most newborns are born with reduced levels of \\nvitamin K–dependent factors, hemorrhagic complications \\ndevelop only rarely. Infants at risk for hemorrhagic disease \\nof the newborn have the most profound deficiency of vitamin \\nK–dependent factors, and these factors decline further after \\nbirth. Because breast milk is a poor source of vitamin K, breast \\nfed infants are at increased risk for hemorrhage that usually \\noccurs between days 3 and 7 of life. Bleeding usually ensues \\nfrom the umbilical cord, circumcision site, intestines, scalp, \\nmucosa, and skin, but internal hemorrhage places the infant \\nat risk for fatal complications, such as intracranial bleeding.\\nHemorrhage on the first day of life resulting from a deficiency \\nof the vitamin K–dependent factors often is associated with \\nadministration to the mother of drugs that affect vitamin K \\nmetabolism in the infant. This early pattern of hemorrhage has \\nbeen seen with maternal warfarin or antibiotic (e.g., isoniazid \\nor rifampin) therapy and in infants of mothers receiving phe-\\nnobarbital and phenytoin. Bleeding also may occur 1-3 months \\nafter birth, particularly among breast fed infants.

Specific factor \\nlevels confirm the diagnosis of hemophilia.\\nCHAPTER 63 \\nNecrotizing Enterocolitis\\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a syndrome of intestinal \\ninjury and is the most common intestinal emergency occurring \\nin preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. \\nNEC occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 live births and 1-8% of admissions \\nto the neonatal intensive care unit. Prematurity is the most \\nconsistent and significant factor associated with neonatal NEC. \\nThe disease occurs in 4-13% of infants who weigh less than \\n1,500 g at birth. NEC is infrequent in term infants ( <10% of \\naffected infants).\\nMost cases of NEC occur in premature infants born before \\n34 weeks’ gestation who have been fed enterally. Prematurity \\nis associated with immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract, \\nincluding decreased integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, \\ndepressed mucosal enzymes, suppressed gastrointestinal hor-\\nmones, suppressed intestinal host defense system, decreased \\ncoordination of intestinal motility, and differences in blood \\nflow autoregulation, which is thought to play a significant \\nrole in the pathogenesis of NEC. More than 90% of infants \\ndiagnosed with NEC have been fed enterally, but NEC has \\nbeen reported in infants who have never been fed. Feeding \\nwith human milk has shown a beneficial role in reducing the \\nincidence of NEC. In addition, probiotics may offer potential \\nbenefits for the preterm infant by increasing mucosal barrier \\nfunction, improving nutrition, upregulating the immune system, \\nand reducing mucosal colonization by potential pathogens. It also \\nis theorized that compromised intestinal blood flow contributes  \\nto NEC.\\nEarly clinical signs of NEC include abdominal distention, \\nfeeding intolerance/increased gastric residuals, emesis, rectal \\nbleeding, and occasional diarrhea. As the disease progresses, \\npatients may develop marked abdominal distention, bilious \\nemesis, ascites, abdominal wall erythema, lethargy, temperature \\ninstability, increased episodes of apnea/bradycardia, disseminated \\nintravascular coagulation, and shock. With abdominal perfora-\\ntion, the abdomen may develop a bluish discoloration.\\nThe white blood cell count can be elevated, but often it is \\ndepressed. Thrombocytopenia is common. In addition, infants \\nmay develop coagulation abnormalities along with metabolic \\nderangements, including metabolic acidosis, electrolyte \\nimbalance, and hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. No unique \\ninfectious agent has been associated with NEC; bacteriological \\nand fungal cultures may prove helpful but not conclusive.\\nRadiographic imaging is essential to the diagnosis of NEC. \\nThe earliest radiographic finding is intestinal ileus, often associ-\\nated with thickening of the bowel loops and air-fluid levels. The \\npathognomonic radiographic finding is pneumatosis intestinalis \\ncaused by hydrogen gas production from pathogenic bacteria \\npresent between the subserosal and muscularis layers of the \\nbowel wall. Radiographic findings also may include a fixed or \\ncount without producing other adverse effects. These drugs \\ninclude sulfonamides, quinidine, quinine, and thiazide diuretics.\\nThe most common causes of thrombocytopenia in well \\nnewborns are transient isoimmune thrombocytopenia and \\ntransient neonatal thrombocytopenia. Isoimmune throm -\\nbocytopenia is caused by antiplatelet antibodies produced by \\nthe HPLA1-negative mother after her sensitization to specific \\npaternal platelet antigen (HPA-1a and HPA-5b represent 85% \\nand 10% of cases, respectively) expressed on the fetal platelet. \\nThe incidence is 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,000 births. This response \\nto maternal-sensitized antibodies that produce isoimmune \\nthrombocytopenia is analogous to the response that produces \\nerythroblastosis fetalis. The maternal antiplatelet antibody does \\nnot produce maternal thrombocytopenia, but after crossing the \\nplacenta this IgG antibody binds to fetal platelets that are trapped \\nby the reticuloendothelial tissue, resulting in thrombocytopenia. \\nInfants with thrombocytopenia produced in this manner are \\nat risk for development of petechiae, purpura, and intracranial \\nhemorrhage (an incidence of 10-15%) before or after birth. \\nVaginal delivery may increase the risk of neonatal bleeding; \\ncesarean section may be indicated.\\nSpecific treatment for severe thrombocytopenia ( <20,000 \\nplatelets/mm3) or significant bleeding is transfusion of \\nABO-compatible and RhD-compatible, HPA-1a-negative and \\nHPA-5b-negative maternal platelets. Because the antibody in \\nisoimmune thrombocytopenia is directed against the fetal rather \\nthan the maternal platelet, thrombocytapheresis of the mother \\nyields sufficient platelets to treat the affected infant. After one \\nplatelet transfusion, the infant’s platelet count dramatically \\nincreases and usually remains in a safe range. Without treatment, \\nthrombocytopenia resolves during the first month of life as \\nthe maternal antibody level declines. Treatment of the mother \\nwith intravenous immunoglobulin or the thrombocytopenic \\nfetus with intravascular platelet transfusion (cordocentesis) is \\nalso effective. Cesarean section reduces the risk of intracranial \\nhemorrhage.\\nNeonatal thrombocytopenia in infants born to women \\nwith idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)  also is a \\nresult of placental transfer of maternal IgG antibodies. In ITP , \\nthese autoantibodies are directed against all platelet antigens; \\nmother and newborn may have low platelet counts.

Primitive reflexes, such as \\nthe Moro, grasp, stepping, rooting, sucking, and crossed extensor \\nreflexes, are readily elicited and are normal for this age. In \\naddition, the newborn has a wealth of cortical functions that \\nare less easily shown (e.g., the ability to extinguish repetitive \\nor painful stimuli). The newborn also has the capacity for \\nattentive eye fixation and differential responses to the mother’s \\nvoice. During the perinatal period, many pathophysiological \\nmechanisms can adversely and permanently affect the developing \\nbrain, including prenatal events, such as hypoxia, ischemia, \\ninfections, inflammation, malformations, maternal drugs, and \\ncoagulation disorders, as well as postnatal events, such as birth \\ntrauma, hypoxia-ischemia, inborn errors of metabolism, \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nSeizures and Other Paroxysmal Disorders\\nHypocalcemia\\nSeizures during the neonatal period may be the result of multiple \\ncauses, with characteristic historical and clinical manifesta -\\ntions. Seizures caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy \\n(postasphyxial seizures), a common cause of seizures in the \\nfull-term infant, usually occur 12-24 hours after a history of \\nbirth asphyxia and often are refractory to conventional doses \\nof anticonvulsant medications. Postasphyxial seizures also may \\nbe caused by metabolic disorders associated with neonatal \\nasphyxia, such as hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia. Intraven-\\ntricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common cause of seizures in \\npremature infants and often occurs between 1 and 3 days of \\nage. Seizures with IVH are associated with a bulging fontanelle, \\nhemorrhagic spinal fluid, anemia, lethargy, and coma. Seizures \\ncaused by hypoglycemia often occur when blood glucose levels \\ndecline to the lowest postnatal value (at 1-2 hours of age or \\nafter 24-48 hours of poor nutritional intake). Seizures caused \\nby hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia develop in high-risk \\ninfants and respond well to therapy with calcium, magnesium, \\nor both.\\nSeizures noted in the delivery room often are caused by \\ndirect injection of local anesthetic agents  into the fetal scalp \\n(associated with transient bradycardia and fixed dilated pupils), \\nsevere anoxia, or congenital brain malformation. Seizures after \\nthe first 5 days of life may be the result of infection or drug \\nwithdrawal. Seizures associated with lethargy, acidosis, and a \\nfamily history of infant deaths may be the result of an inborn \\nerror of metabolism. An infant whose parent has a history of \\na neonatal seizure also is at risk for benign familial seizures. \\nIn an infant who appears well, a sudden onset on day 1-3 of \\nlife of seizures that are of short duration and that do not recur \\nmay be the result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Focal seizures \\noften are the result of local cerebral infarction.\\nSeizures may be difficult to differentiate from benign jitteri-\\nness or from tremulousness in infants of diabetic mothers, in \\ninfants with narcotic withdrawal syndrome, and in any infants \\nafter an episode of asphyxia. In contrast to seizures, jitteriness \\nand tremors are sensory dependent, elicited by stimuli, and \\ninterrupted by holding the extremity. Seizure activity becomes \\nmanifested as coarse, fast and slow clonic activity, whereas \\njitteriness is characterized by fine, rapid movement. Seizures \\nmay be associated with abnormal eye movements, such as tonic \\ndeviation to one side. The electroencephalogram often shows \\nseizure activity when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain.

The subdural hematoma does not always cause symp-\\ntoms immediately after birth; with time, however, the red blood \\ncells (RBCs) undergo hemolysis and water is drawn into the \\nhemorrhage because of the high oncotic pressure of protein, \\nresulting in an expanding symptomatic lesion. Anemia, vomiting, \\nseizures, and macrocephaly may occur in an infant who is 1-2 \\nmonths of age and has a subdural hematoma. Child abuse in \\nthis situation should be suspected and appropriate diagnostic \\nevaluation undertaken to identify other possible signs of skeletal, \\nocular, or soft tissue injury. Occasionally, a massive subdural \\nhemorrhage in the neonatal period is caused by rupture of the \\nvein of Galen or by an inherited coagulation disorder, such as \\nhemophilia. Infants with these conditions exhibit shock, seizures, \\nsigns, and staring. Continuous bedside electroencephalographic \\nmonitoring can help identify subtle seizures.\\nThe diagnostic evaluation of infants with seizures should \\ninvolve an immediate determination of capillary blood glucose \\nlevels with a Chemstrip. In addition, blood concentrations of \\nsodium, calcium, glucose, and bilirubin should be determined. \\nWhen infection is suspected, cerebrospinal fluid and blood \\nspecimens should be obtained for culture. After the seizure has \\nstopped, a careful examination should be done to identify signs \\nof increased intracranial pressure, congenital malformations, \\nand systemic illness. If signs of elevated intracranial pressure \\nare absent, a lumbar puncture should be performed. If the \\ndiagnosis is not apparent at this point, further evaluation should \\ninvolve magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, \\nor cerebral ultrasound and tests to determine the presence \\nof an inborn error of metabolism. Determinations of inborn \\nerrors of metabolism are especially important in infants with \\nunexplained lethargy, coma, acidosis, ketonuria, or respiratory  \\nalkalosis.\\nThe treatment of neonatal seizures may be specific, such \\nas treatment of meningitis or the correction of hypoglycemia, \\nhypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, or vitamin \\nB6 deficiency or dependency. In the absence of an identifiable \\ncause, therapy should involve an anticonvulsant agent, such \\nas 20-40 mg/kg of phenobarbital, 10-20 mg/kg of phenytoin, \\nor 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of diazepam.

Grade 4 \\nhemorrhage has a poor prognosis, as does the development of \\nperiventricular, small, echolucent cystic lesions, with or without \\nporencephalic cysts and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. \\nPeriventricular cysts often are noted after the resolution of \\nechodense areas in the periventricular white matter. The cysts \\nmay correspond to the development of periventricular leuko-\\nmalacia, which may be a precursor to cerebral palsy. Extensive \\nintraparenchymal echodensities represent hemorrhagic necrosis. \\nThey are associated with a high mortality rate and have a poor \\nneurodevelopmental prognosis for survivors.\\nTreatment of an acute hemorrhage involves standard \\nsupportive care, including ventilation for apnea and blood \\ntransfusion for hemorrhagic shock. Posthemorrhagic hydro-\\ncephalus may be managed with serial daily lumbar punctures, \\nan external ventriculostomy tube, or a permanent ventricular-\\nperitoneal shunt. Implementation of the shunt often is delayed \\nbecause of the high protein content of the hemorrhagic  \\nventricular fluid.\\nHYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY\\nConditions known to reduce uteroplacental blood flow or to \\ninterfere with spontaneous respiration lead to perinatal hypoxia, \\nlactic acidosis, and, if severe enough to reduce cardiac output or \\ncause cardiac arrest, ischemia. The combination of the reduced \\navailability of oxygen for the brain resulting from hypoxia and \\nthe diminished or absent blood flow to the brain resulting from \\nischemia leads to reduced glucose for metabolism and to an \\naccumulation of lactate that produces local tissue acidosis. After \\nreperfusion, hypoxic-ischemic injury also may be complicated \\nby cell necrosis and vascular endothelial edema, reducing \\nblood flow distal to the involved vessel. Typically, hypoxic-\\nischemic encephalopathy in the term infant is characterized \\nby cerebral edema, cortical necrosis, and involvement of the \\nbasal ganglia, whereas in the preterm infant it is characterized \\nby periventricular leukomalacia. Both lesions may result in \\ncortical atrophy, mental retardation, and spastic quadriplegia  \\nor diplegia.\\nThe clinical manifestations and characteristic course of \\nhypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy vary according to the \\nseverity of the injury (Table 64.2). Infants with severe stage \\nand coma. The treatment of all symptomatic subdural hema-\\ntomas is surgical evacuation.\\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages may be spontaneous, associ -\\nated with hypoxia, or caused by bleeding from a cerebral \\narteriovenous malformation. Seizures are a common presenting \\nmanifestation, and the prognosis depends on the underlying \\ninjury. Treatment is directed at the seizure and the rare occur-\\nrence of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.\\nPeriventricular hemorrhage and IVH are common in very \\nlow birth weight infants; the risk decreases with increasing \\ngestational age. Fifty percent of infants weighing less than \\n1,500 g h ave evidence of intracranial bleeding. The patho -\\ngenesis for these hemorrhages is unknown (they usually are \\nnot caused by coagulation disorders), but the initial site of \\nbleeding may be the weak blood vessels in the periventricular \\ngerminal matrix. The vessels in this area have poor structural \\nsupport. These vessels may rupture and hemorrhage because \\nof passive changes in cerebral blood flow occurring with the \\nvariations of blood pressure that sick premature infants often \\nexhibit (failure of autoregulation). In some sick infants, these \\nblood pressure variations are the only identifiable etiological \\nfactors. In others, the disorders that may cause the elevation \\nor depression of blood pressure or that interfere with venous \\nreturn from the head (venous stasis) increase the risk of IVH; \\nthese disorders include asphyxia, pneumothorax, mechanical \\nventilation, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, prolonged labor, breech \\ndelivery, patent ductus arteriosus, heart failure, and therapy \\nwith hypertonic solutions such as sodium bicarbonate.\\nMost periventricular hemorrhages and IVHs occur in the \\nfirst 3 days of life. It is unusual for IVH to occur after day 5 \\nof life. The clinical manifestations of IVH include seizures, \\napnea, bradycardia, lethargy, coma, hypotension, metabolic \\nacidosis, anemia not corrected by blood transfusion, bulging \\nfontanelle, and cutaneous mottling. Many infants with small \\nhemorrhages (grade 1 or 2) are asymptomatic; infants with \\nlarger hemorrhages (grade 4) often have a catastrophic event \\nthat rapidly progresses to shock and coma.\\nThe diagnosis of IVH is confirmed and the severity graded \\nby ultrasound through the anterior fontanelle or computed \\ntomography examination.

Newborn infants also show a deficit in phagocytic \\nmigration to the site of infection (to the lung) and in the bone \\nmarrow reserve pool of leukocytes. In addition, in the presence \\nof suboptimal activation of complement, neonatal neutrophils \\ningest and kill bacteria less effectively than adult neutrophils \\ndo. Neutrophils from sick infants seem to have an even greater \\ndeficit in bacterial killing capacity compared with phagocytic \\ncells from normal neonates.\\nDefense mechanisms against viral pathogens also may be \\ndeficient in a newborn. Neonatal antibody-dependent, cell-\\nmediated immunity by the natural killer lymphocytes is deficient \\nin the absence of maternal antibodies and in the presence of \\nreduced interferon production; reduced antibody levels occur \\nin premature infants and in infants born during a primary viral \\ninfection of the mother, such as with enteroviruses, HSV-2, or \\ncytomegalovirus. In addition, antibody-independent cytotoxicity \\nmay be reduced in lymphocytes of newborns.\\nBacterial sepsis and meningitis often are linked closely in \\nneonates. Despite this association, the incidence of meningitis \\nrelative to neonatal sepsis has been on a steady decline. The \\nincidence of meningitis is approximately 1 in 20 cases of sepsis. \\nThe causative organisms isolated most frequently are the same \\nas for neonatal sepsis: group B streptococci, E. coli, and L. \\nmonocytogenes. Gram-negative organisms, such as Klebsiella, \\nSalmonella, and Serratia marcescens, are more common in less \\ndeveloped countries, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus \\nneeds to be considered in very low birth weight infants. Male \\ninfants seem to be more susceptible to neonatal infection than \\nfemale infants. Severely premature infants are at even greater \\nrisk secondary to less effective defense mechanisms and deficient \\ntransfer of antibodies from the mother to the fetus (which occurs \\nmostly after 32 weeks’ gestation). Neonates in the neonatal \\nintensive care unit live in a hostile environment, with exposure \\nto endotracheal tubes, central arterial and venous catheters, and \\nblood draws, all predisposing to bacteremia and meningitis. \\nGenetic factors have been implicated in the ability of bacteria \\nto cross the blood-brain barrier. This penetration has been \\nnoted for group B streptococci, E. coli, Listeria, Citrobacter, \\nand Streptococcus pneumoniae.\\nNeonatal sepsis presents during three periods. Early-onset \\nsepsis often begins in utero and usually is a result of infection \\ncaused by the bacteria in the mother’s genitourinary tract. \\nOrganisms related to this sepsis include group B streptococci, E. \\ncoli, Klebsiella, L. monocytogenes, and nontypeable H. influenzae. \\nMost infected infants are premature and show nonspecific \\ncardiorespiratory signs, such as grunting, tachypnea, and \\ncyanosis at birth. Risk factors for early-onset sepsis include \\nvaginal colonization with group B streptococci, prolonged \\nrupture of the membranes (>24 hours), amnionitis, maternal \\nfever or leukocytosis, fetal tachycardia, and preterm birth. \\nAfrican American race and male sex are unexplained additional \\nrisk factors for neonatal sepsis.\\nEarly-onset sepsis (birth to 7 days) is an overwhelming \\nmultiorgan system disease frequently manifested as respiratory \\nfailure, shock, meningitis (in 30% of cases), disseminated intra-\\nvascular coagulation, acute tubular necrosis, and symmetrical \\nperipheral gangrene. Early manifestations—grunting, poor \\nfeeding, pallor, apnea, lethargy, hypothermia, or an abnormal \\ncry—may be nonspecific. Profound neutropenia, hypoxia, and \\nhypotension may be refractory to treatment with broad-spectrum \\n3 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are usually hypotonic, \\nalthough occasionally they initially appear hypertonic and \\nhyperalert at birth. As cerebral edema develops, brain functions \\nare affected in a descending order; cortical depression produces \\ncoma, and brainstem depression results in apnea. As cerebral \\nedema progresses, refractory seizures begin 12-24 hours after \\nbirth. Concurrently the infant has no signs of spontaneous \\nrespirations, is hypotonic, and has diminished or absent deep \\ntendon reflexes. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in term \\ninfants is often managed with induced hyperthermia.\\nSurvivors of stage 3 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy have \\na high incidence of seizures and serious neurodevelopmental \\nhandicaps. The prognosis of severe asphyxia also depends on \\nother organ system injury (see Table 58.6). Another indicator \\nof poor prognosis is time of onset of spontaneous respiration \\nas estimated by Apgar score. Infants with Apgar scores of 0-3 \\nat 10 minutes have a 20% mortality and a 5% incidence of \\ncerebral palsy; if the score remains this low by 20 minutes, \\nthe mortality increases to 60%, and the incidence of cerebral \\npalsy increases to 57%.\\nCHAPTER 65 \\nSepsis and Meningitis\\nSystemic and local infections (lung, cutaneous, ocular, umbilical, \\nkidney, bone-joint, and meningeal) are common in the newborn \\nperiod. Infection may be acquired in utero through the trans-\\nplacental or transcervical routes and during or after birth. \\nAscending infection through the cervix, with or without rupture \\nof the amniotic fluid membranes, may result in amnionitis, \\nfunisitis (infection of the umbilical cord), congenital pneumonia, \\nand sepsis. The bacteria responsible for ascending infection of \\nthe fetus are common bacterial organisms of the maternal \\ngenitourinary tract, such as group B streptococci, Escherichia \\ncoli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella . Herpes simplex \\nvirus (HSV)-1 or, more often, HSV-2 also causes ascending \\ninfection that at times may be indistinguishable from bacterial \\nsepsis. Syphilis and Listeria monocytogenes are acquired by \\ntransplacental infection.\\nMaternal humoral immunity may protect the fetus against \\nsome neonatal pathogens, such as group B streptococci and HSV . \\nNonetheless, various deficiencies of the neonatal antimicrobial \\ndefense mechanism probably are more important than maternal \\nimmune status as a contributing factor for neonatal infection, \\nespecially in the low birth weight infant. The incidence of sepsis \\nis approximately 1  :  1,500 in f ull-term infants and 1  :  250 in \\npreterm infants. The sixfold-higher rate of sepsis in preterm \\ninfants relates to the more immature immunological systems of \\npreterm infants and to their prolonged periods of hospitaliza-\\ntion, which increase risk of nosocomially acquired infectious  \\ndiseases.\\nPreterm infants before 32 weeks of gestational age have \\nnot received the full complement of maternal antibodies \\n(immunoglobulin G [IgG]), which cross the placenta by \\nactive transport predominantly in the latter half of the third \\ntrimester.

Clinical manifestations may include lethargy, \\npoor feeding, hypotonia, apathy, seizures, bulging fontanelle, \\nfever, and direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. In addition to \\nbacteremia, hematogenous seeding may result in focal infections, \\nsuch as meningitis (in 75% of cases), osteomyelitis (group B \\nstreptococci, Staphylococcus aureus), arthritis (gonococcus, S. \\naureus, Candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria), and urinary \\ntract infection (gram-negative bacteria).\\nThe evaluation of infants with late-onset sepsis is similar to \\nthat for infants with early-onset sepsis, with special attention \\ngiven to a careful physical examination of the bones (infants with \\nosteomyelitis may exhibit pseudoparalysis) and to the laboratory \\nexamination and culture of urine obtained by sterile suprapubic \\naspiration or urethral catheterization. Late-onset sepsis may be \\ncaused by the same pathogens as early-onset sepsis, but infants \\nexhibiting sepsis late in the neonatal period also may have \\ninfections caused by the pathogens usually found in older infants \\n(H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis). In \\naddition, viral agents (HSV , cytomegalovirus, or enteroviruses) \\nmay manifest with a late-onset, sepsis-like picture.\\nBecause of the increased rate of resistance of H. influenzae \\nand pneumococcus to ampicillin, some centers begin treat -\\nment with ampicillin and a third-generation cephalosporin \\n(and vancomycin if meningitis is present) when sepsis occurs \\nin the last week of the first month of life. The treatment of \\nlate-onset neonatal sepsis and meningitis is the same as that \\nfor early-onset sepsis.\\nCHAPTER 66 \\nCongenital Infections\\nAn infection acquired transplacentally during gestation is \\na congenital infection. Numerous pathogens that produce \\nmild or subclinical disease in older infants and children can \\ncause severe disease in neonates who acquire such infections \\nprenatally or perinatally. Sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and \\nother infections caused by numerous perinatally acquired \\npathogens are the cause of significant neonatal morbidity \\nand mortality. Congenital infections include a well-known \\ngroup of fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens: toxoplasmo-\\nsis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus \\n(HSV), varicella-zoster virus, congenital syphilis, parvovirus, \\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, Zika \\nvirus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia, and Mycobacterium  \\ntuberculosis.\\nMany of the clinical manifestations of congenital infec -\\ntions are similar, including intrauterine growth restriction, \\nnonimmune hydrops, anemia, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, \\nhepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, and congenital malfor-\\nmations. Some unique manifestations and epidemiological \\ncharacteristics of these infections are listed in Table 66.1. \\nEvaluation of patients thought to have a congenital infection \\nshould include attempts to isolate the organism by culture (for \\nrubella, CMV , HSV , gonorrhea, and M. tuberculosis), to identify \\nantibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors such as \\ndopamine. In the initial stages of early-onset septicemia in \\na preterm infant, it is often difficult to differentiate sepsis \\nfrom respiratory distress syndrome. Because of this difficulty, \\npremature infants with respiratory distress syndrome receive \\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics.\\nThe clinical manifestations of sepsis are difficult to separate \\nfrom the manifestations of meningitis in the neonate. Infants with \\nearly-onset sepsis should be evaluated by blood and cerebrospinal \\nfluid (CSF) cultures, CSF Gram stain, cell count, and protein \\nand glucose levels. Normal newborns generally have an elevated \\nCSF protein content (100-150 m g/dL) and may have 25-30/mm3 \\nwhite blood cells (mean, 9/mm3), which are 75% lymphocytes in \\nthe absence of infection. Some infants with neonatal meningitis \\ncaused by group B streptococci do not have an elevated CSF \\nleukocyte count but are seen to have microorganisms in the \\nCSF on Gram stain. In addition to culture, other methods of \\nidentifying the pathogenic bacteria are the determination of \\nbacterial DNA in samples of CSF . In cases of neonatal meningitis, \\nthe ratio of CSF glucose to blood glucose usually is less than \\n50%. The polymerase chain reaction test primarily is used to \\nidentify viral infections. Serial complete blood counts should \\nbe performed to identify neutropenia, an increased number of \\nimmature neutrophils (bands), and thrombocytopenia. C-reactive \\nprotein levels are often elevated in neonatal patients with  \\nbacterial sepsis.\\nA chest radiograph also should be obtained to determine the \\npresence of pneumonia. In addition to the traditional neonatal \\npathogens, pneumonia in very low birth weight infants may \\nbe the result of acquisition of maternal genital mycoplasmal \\nagent (e.g., Ureaplasma urealyticum or Mycoplasma hominis). \\nArterial blood gases should be monitored to detect hypoxemia \\nand metabolic acidosis that may be caused by hypoxia, shock, \\nor both. Blood pressure, urine output, and peripheral perfusion \\nshould be monitored to determine the need to treat septic shock \\nwith fluids and vasopressor agents.\\nThe mainstay of treatment for sepsis and meningitis is anti-\\nbiotic therapy. Antibiotics are used to suppress bacterial growth, \\nallowing the infant’s defense mechanisms time to respond. In \\naddition, support measures, such as assisted ventilation and \\ncardiovascular support, are equally important to the management \\nof the infant. A combination of ampicillin and an aminoglyco-\\nside (usually gentamicin) for 10-14 days is effective treatment \\nagainst most organisms responsible for early-onset sepsis. The \\ncombination of ampicillin and cefotaxime also is proposed as \\nan alternative method of treatment. If meningitis is present, the \\ntreatment should be extended to 21 days or 14 days after a nega-\\ntive result from a CSF culture. Persistently positive results from \\nCSF cultures are common with neonatal meningitis caused by \\ngram-negative organisms, even with appropriate antibiotic treat-\\nment, and may be present for 2-3 days after antibiotic therapy. If \\ngram-negative meningitis is present, some authorities continue \\nto treat with an effective penicillin derivative combined with \\nan aminoglycoside, whereas most change to a third-generation \\ncephalosporin.

Fetal infection rarely can \\noccur after reactivation of disease in an immunocompromised \\npregnant mother. Transmission from an acutely infected mother \\nto her fetus occurs in about 30-40% of cases, but the rate varies \\ndirectly with gestational age. Transmission rates and the timing \\nof fetal infection correlate directly with placental blood flow; \\nthe risk of infection increases throughout gestation to 90% or \\ngreater near term, and the time interval between maternal and \\nfetal infection decreases.\\nThe severity of fetal disease varies inversely with the \\ngestational age at which maternal infection occurs. Most \\ninfants have subclinical infection with no overt disease at \\nbirth; however, specific ophthalmologic and central nervous \\nsystem (CNS) evaluations may reveal abnormalities. The classic \\nfindings of hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and intracerebral \\ncalcifications suggest the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. \\nAffected infants tend to be small for gestational age, develop \\nearly-onset jaundice, have hepatosplenomegaly, and present \\nwith a generalized maculopapular rash. Seizures are common, \\nand skull films may reveal diffuse cortical calcifications in \\ncontrast to the periventricular pattern observed with CMV . \\nThese infants are at increased risk for long-term neurological \\nand neurodevelopmental complications.\\nSerological tests are the primary means of diagnosis. IgG-\\nspecific antibodies achieve a peak concentration 1-2 months \\nafter infection and remain positive indefinitely. For infants with \\nseroconversion or a fourfold increase in IgG titers, specific \\nIgM antibody determinations should be performed to confirm \\ndisease. Especially for congenital infections, measurement of \\nIgA and IgE antibodies can be useful to confirm the disease. \\nThorough ophthalmologic, auditory, and neurological evalu-\\nations (head computed tomography and cerebrospinal fluid \\n[CSF] examination) are indicated.\\nFor symptomatic and asymptomatic congenital infections, \\ninitial therapy should include pyrimethamine (supplemented \\nwith folic acid) combined with sulfadiazine. Duration of therapy \\nis often prolonged, even up to 1 year. Optimal dosages of \\nmedications and duration of therapy should be determined \\nin consultation with appropriate specialists.\\nWith the widespread use of vaccination, congenital rubella is \\nrare in developed countries. Acquired in utero during early \\ngestation, rubella can cause severe neonatal consequences. The \\noccurrence of congenital defects approaches 85% if infection \\nis acquired during the first 4 weeks of gestation; close to 40% \\nspontaneously abort or are stillborn. If infection occurs during \\nweeks 13-16, 35% of infants can have abnormalities. Infection \\nafter 4 months’ gestation does not seem to cause disease.\\nThe most common characteristic abnormalities associated \\nwith congenital rubella include ophthalmologic (cataracts, \\nretinopathy, and glaucoma), cardiac (patent ductus arteriosus and \\nperipheral pulmonary artery stenosis), auditory (sensorineural \\nhearing loss), and neurological (behavioral disorders, meningo-\\nencephalitis, and developmental delay) conditions. In addition, \\ninfants can present with growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, \\nearly-onset jaundice, thrombocytopenia, radiolucent bone \\ndisease, and purpuric skin lesions (“blueberry muffin” appear-\\nance from dermal erythropoiesis).\\nDetection of rubella-specific IgM antibody usually indicates \\nrecent infection. Measurement of rubella-specific IgG over \\nseveral months can be confirmatory. Rubella virus can be isolated \\nfrom blood, urine, CSF , and throat swab specimens. Infants with \\ncongenital rubella are chronically and persistently infected and \\ntend to shed live virus in urine, stools, and respiratory secretions \\nfor 1 year. Infants should be isolated while in the hospital and \\nkept away from susceptible pregnant women when sent home.\\nCYTOMEGALOVIRUS\\nCMV is the most common congenital infection and the \\nleading cause of sensorineural hearing loss, mental retardation, \\nretinal disease, and cerebral palsy. Congenital CMV occurs in \\nabout 0.5-1.5% of births. When primary infection occurs in \\nmothers during a pregnancy, the virus is transmitted to the \\nfetus in approximately 35% of cases. Rates of CMV infection \\nare three to seven times greater in infants born to adolescent \\nmothers compared to others.

The most common sources of CMV for primary \\ninfections occurring in mothers during pregnancy are sexual \\ncontacts and contact with young children. It is well known \\nthat CMV can be transmitted to the fetus even when maternal \\ninfection occurred long before conception. This transmission \\ncan occur as the result of virus reactivation, chronic infection, \\nor reinfection with a new strain.\\nMore than 90% of infants who have congenital CMV infection \\nexhibit no clinical evidence of disease at birth. Approximately \\n10% of infected infants are small for gestational age and have \\nsymptoms at birth. Findings include microcephaly, thrombocyto-\\npenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, intracranial calcifications, \\nchorioretinitis, and hearing abnormalities. Some infants can \\npresent with a blueberry muffin appearance as the result of \\ndermal erythropoiesis. Skull films may reveal periventricular \\ncalcifications. An additional 10% of infected infants may not \\npresent until later in infancy or early childhood, when they are \\nfound to have sensorineural hearing loss and developmental \\ndelays. Mortality is 10-15% in symptomatic newborns. Perinatal \\nCMV infection acquired during birth or from mother’s milk is \\nnot associated with newborn illness or CNS sequelae.\\nCongenital CMV infection is diagnosed by detection of \\nvirus in the urine or saliva. Detection is often accomplished \\nby traditional virus culture methods but can take several weeks \\nto obtain a result. Rapid culture methods using centrifugation \\nto enhance infectivity and monoclonal antibody to detect early \\nantigens in infected tissue culture can give results in 24 hours. \\nPCR also can be used to detect small amounts of CMV DNA \\nin the urine.

About \\n70-85% of neonatal herpes simplex infections are caused by \\nHSV-2. Most commonly, neonatal infections are acquired from \\nthe mother shortly before (ascending infection) or during \\npassage through the birth canal at delivery. The incidence of \\nneonatal HSV is estimated to range from 1 in 3,000 to 1 in \\n20,000 live births. Infants with HSV infections are more likely \\nto be born prematurely (40% of affected infants are <36 weeks’ \\ngestation). The risk of infection at delivery in an infant born \\nvaginally to a mother with primary genital herpes is about \\n33-50%. The risk to an infant born to a mother with a reactivated \\ninfection is less than 5%. More than 75% of infants who acquire \\nHSV infection are born to mothers who have no previous history \\nor clinical findings consistent with HSV infection.\\nMost infants are normal at birth, and symptoms of infec -\\ntion develop at 5-10 days of life. Symptoms of neonatal HSV \\ninfection include disseminated disease involving multiple organ \\nsystems, most notably the liver and lungs; localized infection \\nto the CNS; or localized infection to the skin, eyes, and mouth. \\nSymptoms may overlap, and in many cases of disseminated \\ndisease, skin lesions are a late finding. Disseminated infection \\nshould be considered in any infant with symptoms of sepsis, \\nliver dysfunction, and negative bacteriological cultures. HSV \\ninfection also should be suspected in any neonate who presents \\nwith fever, irritability, abnormal CSF findings, and seizures. \\nInitial symptoms can occur anytime between birth and 4 weeks \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nRhinorrhea\\nAbnormal Head Size, Shape, and Fontanels\\nRed Eye\\nHoarseness\\nHepatomegaly\\nHearing Loss\\nLymphadenopathy\\nCongenital syphilis most commonly results from transplacental \\ninfection of the fetus, although the fetus can acquire infection \\nby contact with a chancre at birth. In addition, hematogenous \\ninfection can occur throughout pregnancy. The longer the time \\nelapsed between the mother’s infection and pregnancy, the less \\nlikely she is to transmit the disease to the fetus.\\nIntrauterine infection can result in stillbirth, hydrops \\nfetalis, or prematurity. Clinical symptoms vary but include \\nhepatosplenomegaly, snuffles, lymphadenopathy, mucocuta-\\nneous lesions, osteochondritis, rash, hemolytic anemia, and \\nthrombocytopenia. Untreated infants, regardless of whether they \\nmanifest symptoms at birth, may develop late symptoms, which \\nusually appear after 2 years of age and involve the CNS, bones, \\njoints, teeth, eyes, and skin. Some manifestations of disease \\nmay not become apparent until many years after birth, such as \\ninterstitial keratitis, eighth cranial nerve deafness, Hutchinson \\nteeth, bowing of the shins, frontal bossing, mulberry molars, \\nsaddle nose, rhagades, and Clutton joints. The combination \\nof interstitial keratitis, eighth cranial nerve deafness, and \\nHutchinson teeth is commonly referred to as the Hutchinson \\ntriad (see Table 66.1).\\nMany infants are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. If \\nuntreated, most infants develop symptoms within the first 5 \\nweeks of life. The most striking lesions affect the mucocutane-\\nous tissues and bones.

All infants born to seropositive mothers require a \\ncareful examination and a quantitative nontreponemal syphilis \\ntest. Dark-field examination of direct fluorescent antibody \\nstaining of organisms obtained by scraping a skin or mucous \\nmembrane lesion is the quickest and most direct method of \\ndiagnosis. More commonly, serological testing is used. The \\nnontreponemal reaginic antibody assays—the Venereal Disease \\nResearch Laboratory (VDRL) and the rapid plasma reagin—are \\nhelpful as indicators of disease. The test performed on the \\ninfant should be the same as that performed on the mother \\nto enable comparison of results. An infant should be evalu-\\nated further if the maternal titer has increased fourfold, if the \\ninfant’s titer is fourfold greater than the mother’s titer, if the \\ninfant is symptomatic, or if the mother has inadequately treated \\nsyphilis. A mother infected later in pregnancy may deliver an \\ninfant who is incubating active disease. The mother and infant \\nmay have negative serological testing at birth. When clinical \\nor serological tests suggest congenital syphilis, CSF should \\nbe examined microscopically, and a CSF VDRL test should \\nbe performed.

Allen\\nCHAPTER 67 \\nOverview and Assessment  \\nof Adolescents\\nThe leading causes of mortality (Table 67.1) and morbidity \\n(Table 67.2) in adolescents in the United States are behaviorally \\nmediated. Motor vehicle injuries and other injuries account for \\nmore than 75% of all deaths. Unhealthy dietary behaviors and \\ninadequate physical activity result in adolescent obesity, with \\nassociated health complications (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).\\nIt is the physician’s responsibility to use every opportunity \\nto inquire about risk-taking behaviors (Fig. 67.1), regardless \\nof the presenting issue. Physical symptoms in adolescents are \\noften related to psychosocial problems.\\nINTERVIEWING ADOLESCENTS\\nThe adolescent interview shifts from information gathering \\nfrom the parent to the adolescent. Interviewing an adolescent \\nalone and discussing confidentiality are the cornerstones of \\nobtaining information regarding risk-taking behaviors, anticipa-\\ntory guidance, and protective factors (see Chapters 7 and 9).\\nThe interview should take into account the developmental \\nage of the adolescent (Table 67.3). Conversations about sports, \\nfriends, movies, and activities outside of school can be useful \\nfor all ages and help build rapport (Fig. 67.2).\\nConfidentiality is a key element in interviewing an adolescent \\n(Table 67.4). A vital, open discussion about risk-taking behavior \\nis more likely to happen when the adolescent is alone (Table \\n67.5). Some issues cannot be kept confidential, such as suicidal \\nintent and disclosure of sexual or physical abuse. If there is an \\nambiguous situation, it is wise to obtain legal, ethical, or social \\nwork consultation. In caring for a young adolescent, the health \\ncare provider should encourage open discussions with a parent, \\nguardian, or other adult.\\nThe law confers certain rights on adolescents, depending on \\ntheir health condition and personal characteristics; this allows \\nthem to receive health services without parental permission \\n(Table 67.6). Usually adolescents can seek health care without \\nparental consent for reproductive, mental, and emergency \\nhealth services. Emancipated adolescents and mature minors \\nmay be treated without parental consent; this status should be \\ndocumented in the record. The key characteristics of mature \\nminors are their competence and capacity to understand, not \\ntheir chronological age. There must be a reasonable judgment \\nthat the health intervention is in the best interests of the minor.\\nTABLE 67.1 Leading Causes of Death in Adolescents\\nRANK CAUSE RATE (PER 100,000)\\n1 Unintentional injuries 26.9\\n2 Suicide 11.5\\n3 Assault (homicide) 9.4\\n4 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) 3.6\\n5 Diseases of the heart 2.2\\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health \\nStatistics: National Vital Statistics 2014.\\nTABLE 67.2 Prevalence of Common Chronic Illnesses in \\nChildren and Adolescents\\nILLNESS PREVALENCE\\nPULMONARY\\n•\\t Asthma 8-12%\\n•\\t Cystic\\tfibrosis 1\\t:\\t2,500\\twhite,\\t1\\t:\\t17,000\\tblack\\nNEUROMUSCULAR\\n•\\t Cerebral\\tpalsy 2-3 : 1,000\\n•\\t Mental\\tretardation 1-2%\\n•\\t Seizure\\tdisorder 3.5 : 1,000\\n•\\t Any\\tseizure 3-5%\\n•\\t Auditory/visual\\tdefects 2-3%\\n•\\t Traumatic\\tparalysis 2 : 1,000\\n•\\t Scoliosis 3% males, 5% females\\n•\\t Migraine 6-27% (↑ with increasing age)\\nENDOCRINE/NUTRITION\\n•\\t Diabetes\\tmellitus 1.8 : 1,000\\n•\\t Obesity 25-30%\\n•\\t Anorexia\\tnervosa 0.5-1%\\n•\\t Bulimia 1%\\t(early\\tadolescence),\\t \\n5-10%\\t(19-20\\tyears)\\n•\\t Dysmenorrhea 20%\\n•\\t Acne 65%\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Greater emphasis is placed on \\nthe late adolescent’s responsibility for his or her health.\\nPELVIC EXAMINATION\\nA full pelvic examination is rarely required in a virginal adoles-\\ncent girl. A bimanual rectal-abdominal examination (all midline \\ninternal genitalia are immediately anterior to the rectal wall) \\nis as efficient as a vaginal-abdominal examination. In some \\ngirls, anesthesia may be required for a full pelvic examination.\\nBefore a pelvic examination, the patient should be informed \\nabout the importance of the assessment and what maneuvers \\nwill take place; she should be encouraged to ask questions \\nbefore, during, or after the examination. A chaperone should \\nbe offered when a family caregiver is not present. Assuring the \\npatient that she has complete control over the examination and \\nallowing participation by using a mirror or guiding the examiner \\nis important. The examiner should maintain eye contact during \\nthe examination. Before all maneuvers, the patient must be \\ninformed of what to expect and the sensations that may be \\nexperienced.\\nA padded examination table with the patient in a frog-leg \\nposition maximizes comfort during a pelvic examination. Stir-\\nrups can be used but are less comfortable. The examination \\n(adrenarche) and then axillary hair within the year. The growth \\nspurt is a relatively late event; it can occur from 1012  to 16 \\nyears of age. Deepening of the voice, the appearance of facial \\nhair, and acne indicate the early stages of puberty. See Chapter \\n174 for discussion of disorders of puberty.\\nChanges Associated With Physical Maturation\\nTanner stages mark biologic maturation, which can be related \\nto specific changes in laboratory values and certain physical \\nconditions. The higher hematocrit values in adolescent boys \\nthan in adolescent girls are the result of greater androgenic \\nstimulation of the bone marrow and not loss through menstrua-\\ntion. Alkaline phosphatase levels in boys and girls increase \\nduring puberty because of rapid bone turnover, especially during \\nthe growth spurt. Worsening of mild scoliosis is common in \\nadolescents during the growth spurt.\\nPSYCHOLOGICAL GROWTH AND \\nDEVELOPMENT OF ADOLESCENTS\\nSee Table 67.3 and Chapters 7 and 9.\\nCHAPTER 68 \\nWell-Adolescent Care\\nWhen interviewing an adolescent, use a nonjudgmental approach \\nand find some common ground to get the adolescent talking \\nabout himself or herself. Try to focus on the positive actions \\nthat these adolescents are taking to ensure their physical and \\nmental well-being (protective factors). The HEADDSS (home, \\neducation, alcohol, drugs, diet, sex, suicide/depression) mne-\\nmonic addresses important risk-taking elements of the history \\n(see Table 67.5). Adolescents who experiment in one area of \\nrisk-taking often have contemplated or tried multiple other \\nrisk-taking behaviors. When all of the risk-taking information \\nhas been gathered, choose one or two health care issues to \\ndiscuss, making it clear that the information is confidential \\nand that you are there to help the adolescent in a partnership \\nway. Although the focus in adolescent care is on psychosocial \\nissues, a general examination must also be performed (Table \\n68.1). Pediatric issues, such as immunization (see Chapter 94) \\nand health screening, should be included (see Table 9.5).\\nEARLY ADOLESCENCE (AGES 10-14 YEARS)\\nRapid changes in physical appearance and behavior are the \\nmajor characteristics of early adolescence, leading to a great \\ndeal of self-consciousness and need for privacy. The history \\nfocuses on the early adolescent’s physical and psychosocial \\nhealth.\\nMIDDLE ADOLESCENCE (AGES 15-17 YEARS)\\nAutonomy and a global sense of identity are the major \\ncharacteristics of middle adolescence. The history focuses on \\nthe middle adolescent’s interactions with family, school, and \\npeers. High-risk behaviors as a result of experimentation are  \\ncommon.\\nTABLE 68.1 Examination of the Adolescent\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION—CHECKLIST\\nExplain\\tto\\tyour\\tpatient\\twhat\\tyou\\tare\\tgoing\\tto\\tdo.\\nExplain\\thow\\tyou\\tare\\tgoing\\tto\\tdo\\tit.\\nAsk\\twhether\\tyour\\tadolescent\\twants\\this\\tor\\ther\\tparent\\tin\\tthe\\t\\nroom.*\\nBe\\tsensitive\\tto\\tthe\\tadolescent’s\\tneeds.\\nAlways\\tuse\\ta\\tsheet\\tor\\tblanket\\tto\\tprovide\\tprivacy.\\nLet\\tthe\\tadolescent\\tremain\\tdressed\\tand\\twork\\taround\\tthe\\tclothing.\\nAsk\\tsome\\tquestions\\tas\\tyou\\tgo\\tthrough\\tthe\\tphysical\\tto\\tkeep\\tthe\\t\\nadolescent\\tat\\tease.\\tGive\\treassurance\\tthat\\telements\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nphysical\\tare\\tnormal\\tfor\\tthis\\tage.\\nASSESSMENT\\nExamination\\tcan\\tbe\\tused\\tto\\toffer\\treassurance\\tabout\\tnormalcy†\\nAssess the following:\\nHeight/weight/body\\tmass\\tindex\\tand\\tplot\\ton\\tpercentile\\tcharts\\nSkin\\tfor\\tacne\\nMouth for periodontal disease\\nTanner staging\\nBreasts and testicles\\nThyroid\\t(palpation)\\nSkeletal:\\tscoliosis,\\tOsgood-Schlatter\\tdisease,\\tslipped\\tcapital\\t\\nfemoral\\tepiphysis\\nMental\\tstatus\\tfor\\tdepression;\\tuse\\tscreening\\ttools\\nSigns\\tof\\tsubstance\\tabuse,\\trisk-taking\\tbehaviors,\\tand\\ttrauma\\n*If not, you will need a chaperone.\\n†For example, 70% of boys can have breast enlargement (gynecomastia), and \\ngirls often have one breast larger than the other.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The \\nexamination should be unhurried but efficient.\\nInspection of the genitalia includes evaluation of the pubic \\nhair, labia majora and minora, clitoris, urethra, and hymenal \\nring. When a speculum examination is required, it must be \\nperformed before bimanual palpation of internal genitalia \\nbecause lubricants interfere with the evaluation of microscopic \\nand microbiologic samples. The speculum allows visualization \\nof the vaginal walls and cervical os for collection of appropriate \\nspecimens, such as cultures or Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. A Pap \\nsmear is not needed until the adolescent is sexually active unless \\nthere is a history of sexual abuse or vulvar infection with human \\npapillomavirus. In the rare circumstance that a vaginal examina-\\ntion is necessary in a virginal girl, a Huffman (0.5 by 4.5 in.) or \\nPederson (0.9 by 4.5 in.) speculum should be used. A nonvirginal \\nintroitus frequently admits a small to medium-sized adult  \\nspeculum.\\nNORMAL VARIANTS OF PUBERTY\\nBreast Asymmetry and Masses\\nIt is not unusual for one breast to begin growth before (or to \\ngrow more rapidly than) the other, with resulting asymmetry. \\nReassurance that after full maturation the asymmetry will be \\nless obvious and that all women have some degree of asymmetry \\nis needed by some. The breast bud is a pea-sized mass below \\nthe nipple that is often tender. Occasionally young women \\npresent with a breast mass; usually these are benign fibroad-\\nenomas or cysts (Table 68.2). Breast cancer is extremely rare \\nin this age group. An ultrasound evaluation is better for the \\nevaluation of young, dense breasts and avoids the radiation \\nexposure of mammography.\\nPhysiological Leukorrhea\\nPeripubertal girls (sexual maturity rating stage III) often complain \\nof vaginal discharge. If the discharge is clear without symptoms \\nof pruritus or odor, it is most likely physiological leukorrhea, \\ndue to ovarian estrogen stimulation of the uterus and vagina. A \\nphysical examination should reveal evidence of an estrogenized \\nvulva and hymen without erythema or excoriation. The physician \\nshould always be alert for signs of abuse. If there are symptoms, \\ncultures should be obtained. In these circumstances, vaginal \\ncultures can be obtained without a speculum because sexually \\ntransmitted infections are vaginal until menarche, when cervical \\ninfections are the rule.

The initial menses are anovula-\\ntory and tend to be irregular in duration. This irregularity may \\npersist for 2-5 years, so reassurance may be required. During \\nthis phase, estrogen feedback on the hypothalamus decreases \\ngonadotropin secretion, which reduces estrogen production \\nand induces an estrogen withdrawal bleed that can be prolonged \\nand heavy. Anovulatory bleeding is usually painless. As the \\nhypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis matures, the cycle becomes \\novulatory and menses are secondary to progesterone withdrawal. \\nWhen ovulation is established, the average cycle length is 21-45 \\ndays.

As regular ovulatory cycles become established, \\npain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint.\\nAmenorrhea\\novarian insufficiency, which may reflect ovarian dysgenesis or \\novarian agenesis and warrants a karyotype. Turner syndrome is \\na common cause, but other chromosomal anomalies, fragile X \\npremutation carriers, and autoimmune etiologies should be ruled \\nout. Low levels of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) suggest \\nhypothalamic dysfunction, which may be due to constitutional \\ndelay (often familial), isolated gonadotropin deficiency, central \\nnervous system (CNS) lesions, or reversible hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadism (chronic illness, low body weight, stressful life \\nevents). Additional hormone evaluation may include thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone and prolactin. Hypothyroidism is a \\ncommon cause of menstrual dysfunction. A prolactinoma, \\nalthough rare, must be ruled out.\\nThe most common causes of secondary amenorrhea are \\npregnancy, anorexia/stress (low LH, FSH, and estradiol), and \\npolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In PCOS, there may \\nbe symptoms of androgen excess, such as acne and hirsut-\\nism, weight gain, and, with insulin resistance, acanthosis. If \\nhirsutism or virilization is present, free and total testosterone, \\nandrostenedione, and dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate should \\nbe measured to rule out ovarian or adrenal tumors. A normal \\n17-hydroxyprogesterone level rules out late-onset congenital \\nadrenal hyperplasia. The diagnosis of PCOS may be dif -\\nficult in adolescence as there is considerable overlap between \\nnormal pubertal development and PCOS. After excluding \\nother etiologies of irregular menses and hyperandrogenism, \\ncurrent recommendations are that PCOS may be diagnosed \\nwith infrequent menstrual bleeding (or amenorrhea) that has \\npersisted for more than 2 years after menarche in conjunction \\nwith clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. \\nHyperandrogenism in adolescents is defined as moderate or \\nsevere hirsutism, persistent acne/poorly responsive to treatment, \\nor persistent elevation of total and/or free testosterone. There \\nare no compelling criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology on \\nimaging in adolescents; therefore, at present, ovarian ultrasound \\nimaging can be deferred during the evaluation of PCOS in this \\nage group. Patients may have impaired glucose tolerance or \\nhypercholesterolemia even in adolescence; hence they should \\nbe screened for these issues.\\nIn a patient with amenorrhea (primary or secondary), normal \\nsecondary sex characteristics, a negative pregnancy test, normal \\nprolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and no evidence \\nof outflow tract obstruction, the total effect of estrogen on \\nthe uterus (rather than a single point estradiol level) can be \\ndetermined by a progesterone withdrawal test. To achieve \\nthis, 5-10  m g of medroxyprogesterone (depending on body \\nweight) is given daily for 5-10 days. If the uterus is normal and \\nprimed by estrogen (an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal \\n[HPO] axis) with no outflow tract obstruction, there should \\nbe bleeding within 1 week after the last progesterone tablet. If \\nthere is bleeding, the amenorrhea is secondary to anovulation. \\nIf there is no progesterone withdrawal bleeding, the uterus has \\nbeen insufficiently exposed to estrogen, and there is systemic \\nestrogen deficiency.\\nTherapy for the amenorrhea should be directed at the cause. \\nAnovulation can be managed with either cyclic progesterone \\nwithdrawal or combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). In \\nirreversible hypothalamic amenorrhea ovarian failure, there is \\nan associated hypoestrogenism. Therapy is directed at replacing \\nestrogen and progesterone, either with a combined hormone \\nreplacement regimen or a CHC.

Ninety-eight percent \\nof adolescents have onset of menarche by age 15; therefore \\ninvestigations should begin at that age in young women without \\nmenses. Other indications for evaluation include the absence \\nof menses by age of 14 with signs of hirsutism or a history of \\nexcessive exercise or an eating disorder, absence of menses at any \\nage with symptoms suggestive of an outflow tract obstruction, \\nor no onset of menses within 3 years of thelarche. Secondary \\namenorrhea refers to the cessation of menses for more than \\n3 consecutive months any time after menarche.\\nPrimary amenorrhea may be a result of functional or ana -\\ntomical abnormalities of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, \\novaries, uterus, or vagina. The most common etiologies are \\npremature ovarian insufficiency and müllerian agenesis.\\nThe history and physical examination should guide the \\ninvestigation. An outflow tract obstruction should be ruled out \\nin adolescents with primary amenorrhea, cyclic abdominal pain, \\nand normal secondary sexual characteristics. An abdominal \\nmass resulting from accumulated blood may be present. Low \\noutflow tract obstructions, such as an imperforate hymen, are \\nvisible on examination. An imperforate hymen is characteristic in \\nappearance, with a blue, bulging membrane. All other obstructed \\noutflow tract anomalies require imaging to confirm the diag-\\nnosis.

This classification system has \\nbeen adopted in multiple guidelines. The PALM categories \\ninclude extremely rare causes of AUB in this age group. Far \\nmore common are the categories of AUB-C (coagulopathy) \\nand AUB-O (ovulatory). Anovulation is the most common \\netiology of AUB in adolescents. Ovulation is a later event in \\npuberty. Without progesterone from the corpus luteum, unop-\\nposed estrogen causes endometrial hyperplasia and irregular \\nendometrial shedding, which can be prolonged and heavy, \\nsometimes life threatening. Progesterone induces a secretory \\nendometrium. When progesterone is withdrawn, the endome-\\ntrium sheds in a synchronous fashion with myometrial and \\nvascular contractions (causing dysmenorrhea but limiting blood \\nloss). For the first 1-2 years after menarche, the majority of \\nadolescent cycles are anovulatory. After 1 year of regular cycles, \\nirregular bleeding usually indicates an organic abnormality. \\nThe differential diagnosis of anovulatory bleeding at that time \\nwould include thyroid dysfunction, PCOS, and adrenal and \\npituitary disorders. Approximately 20% of adolescents with \\nheavy or prolonged menses have a coagulation disorder (even \\nhigher if presenting in early menarche) and 10% have other \\npathology. Clues on history to suspect a coagulopathy are onset \\nof heavy menses with menarche, severity requiring admission \\nor blood transfusion, failure of initial medical therapy and a \\nfamily history of a bleeding disorder, or a personal history of \\nbleeding. If an underlying pathology is discovered, treatment \\nshould be directed at the primary disorder and the second-\\nary menstrual dysfunction.

Iron therapy is also important. If \\nthe etiology of bleeding is related to an immature HPO axis, \\nuse of CHCs to regulate menstruation and allow the HPO \\naxis to mature is appropriate; 6-12 months of therapy may \\nbe sufficient. CHCs are prescribed either cyclically or in an \\nextended fashion (avoiding frequent hormone free intervals) \\nand can manage heavy menstrual bleeding in individuals with \\nbleeding disorders (von Willebrand disease, platelet function \\ndefects, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, etc.).

Laparoscopy is required to diagnose \\nendometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease with certainty, \\nalthough it is usually reserved for patients who fail medical  \\ntherapy.\\nTreatment of primary dysmenorrhea should be considered \\nwith symptoms causing significant distress. First-line therapy \\nis nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; Table 69.3). \\nTo maximize pain relief, NSAIDs should be taken before or \\nas soon as menstruation begins, closely following the dosing \\nschedule. Typically NSAIDs are needed for 2-3 days. If NSAIDs \\nfail to provide adequate relief, CHCs or long-acting reversible \\ncontraceptives (LARCs) may be added. These contraceptives may \\nbe first-line therapy, depending on need for pregnancy preven-\\ntion. If dysmenorrhea persists despite an adequate trial of CHCs \\n(>4 months), an alternative diagnosis, such as endometriosis, \\nshould be considered. When CHCs fail, a laparoscopy may be \\nperformed before advancing therapy to confirm the diagnosis \\nand excise endometriotic lesions. More commonly, additional \\nmedical options are pursued for symptom relief. Extended \\nCHC therapy (84 days of active CHC followed by a 5- to 7-day \\nhormone-free interval) may control symptoms.

Early pregnancy \\n(<8 weeks’ gestational age) can be terminated medically with \\noral mifepristone (RU-486) in combination with misoprostol, \\nmethotrexate with misoprostol, or misoprostol alone. Adoles-\\ncents may not present early enough to explore this option. \\nPsychosocial support and subsequent contraceptive counseling \\nand implementation should be available to adolescents who \\nchoose abortion.\\nCONTRACEPTION\\nAdolescents may begin intercourse without reliable or consistent \\nuse of birth control. While the proportion of adolescents using \\ncontraception the first time they have sex has increased, 20% \\nstill initiate intercourse with no contraception, with higher \\nrates in younger adolescents. All methods of contraception \\nsignificantly reduce the risk of pregnancy when used in a \\nconsistent and correct fashion. The best form of contraception \\nis the one an individual will use; thus counseling adolescents \\nabout all methods and supporting their choice is important. \\nContraceptives can be divided into user-based methods and \\nLARCs. Although LARCs are recommended as first-line \\ncontraceptives to decrease pregnancy, birth, and abortion \\nrates, only the minority of adolescent women currently use \\nthese methods. However, studies have shown that if accurate \\ninformation is provided and barriers such as cost and access \\nare removed, the majority of adolescents choose a LARC \\nmethod. It is important to remind young women that steroi -\\ndal contraception or LARCs do not provide any protection \\nfrom STIs, and condoms should be used to reduce the risk  \\nof infection.\\nSteroidal Contraception\\nLong-Acting Reversible Contraceptives\\nImplants\\nThe subdermal progestin etonogestrel implant is a single rod \\ninserted subcutaneously in the upper inner arm. Effective for 3 \\nyears, it has the lowest failure rate of any contraceptive method \\n(0.05% out of 100 women during the first year of typical use). \\nis similar among different socioeconomic groups, the prevalence \\nof adolescent childbearing is greatest in the lower socioeconomic \\nstrata. Annually, 14 million births occur globally to women \\naged 14-19 years. Risk factors for adolescent pregnancy include \\nlower socioeconomic status, lower educational attainment, low \\nself-esteem, lack of access to contraception, alcohol and drug \\nuse, and adverse early life experiences in the home. Approxi -\\nmately 553,000 U.S. females 15-19 years of age become pregnant \\neach year. Sixty percent of those pregnancies result in births, \\n26% in abortions, and the remainder are pregnancy losses. \\nPrimarily due to the increased use of contraceptives, the teen \\nbirth rate in the United States was reduced to a record low in \\n2013, with an overall decrease of 57% since 1991. Adolescents \\nwho continue their pregnancies have an increased incidence \\nof preterm and very preterm births, low birth weight infants, \\ninfant neonatal admission, postneonatal mortality, child abuse, \\nsubsequent maternal unemployment, and poor maternal \\neducational achievement. Children of adolescent parents \\ncompared with their peers are more likely to have lower \\neducational achievements, be involved with drugs and alcohol, \\nand become adolescent parents.\\nPregnancy risks are influenced by behavior and socioeco -\\nnomic status as well as inherent biologic risks within adolescents. \\nWithin adolescence, pregnancies to women <15 years of age \\npose higher risks than those in women ≥16 years of age. \\nPrenatal care should be adapted to the adolescent to improve \\npregnancy outcome. Multidisciplinary care, a comprehensive \\nnutrition program, and social support improve pregnancy  \\noutcomes.\\nDiagnosis\\nPregnancy should be considered and ruled out in any adolescent \\npresenting with secondary amenorrhea. Frequently pregnant \\nadolescents delay seeking a diagnosis until several periods have \\nbeen missed and initially may not disclose having had inter -\\ncourse. Y oung adolescents may present with other symptoms, \\nsuch as vomiting, vague pains, or deteriorating behavior and \\nmay report normal periods. Because of the varied presentations \\nof adolescent pregnancy, a thorough menstrual history should \\nbe obtained from all menstruating adolescents. Urine pregnancy \\ntests are sensitive approximately 7-10 days after conception. \\nSexual assault or coercion should be screened for in all cases \\nof adolescent pregnancy. It is important to recognize that \\nadolescents’ pregnancies are not all unwanted or unplanned. \\nSensitivity to that awareness and to culture is important in the \\napproach to the pregnant adolescent.\\nWhen pregnancy is confirmed, immediate gestational dating \\nis important to assist in planning. An ultrasound examination for \\ndating is recommended. Options are to continue the pregnancy \\nor abortion (if not beyond 20-24 weeks’ gestation). With the \\nformer, the adolescent may choose to parent the child or have \\nthe child adopted. Pregnant adolescents should be encouraged \\nto involve their families in decision making.\\nContinuation of the Pregnancy\\nAdolescents who continue their pregnancies need preg -\\nnancy care that is adapted for their developmental needs. \\nMultidisciplinary adolescent-specific antenatal care has been \\ndocumented to decrease risks of adolescent pregnancy such \\nas preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal admissions \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

All contain a synthetic estrogen and progesterone \\nthat suppress gonadotropin secretion and ovarian follicle \\ndevelopment and ovulation. CHCs also produce an atrophic \\nendometrium (inhospitable for blastocyst implantation) and \\nthicken cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration. Contra-\\nindications and relative contraindications to CHCs are listed \\nin Tables 69.4 and 69.5. CHCs are 99% effective if taken regularly \\nand have numerous noncontraceptive benefits (decreased acne, \\nless dysmenorrhea, and lighter menstrual flow). Unfortunately \\ntypical use among adolescents often result in much higher \\nfailure rates and continuations rate at 1 year are low. There are \\nmany formulations of combined oral contraceptives available \\nthat vary in the amount of estrogen, progestin, and packing \\n(with or without placebo week, duration of active pills, duration \\nof hormone-free intervals). Unless the adolescent shows the \\nability to take a pill daily, contraception with oral combined \\ncontraceptive pills should be avoided. The contraceptive patch \\nis a 25-cm2 pink patch containing ethinyl estradiol and norel-\\ngestromin that is applied to the skin of the torso, buttocks, or \\narm for 1 week followed by removal and application of a new \\npatch for a total of 3 weeks of patch use. A patch-free week \\nthen follows for a withdrawal bleed. The 4-week cycle is repeated. \\nIn women weighing 90 kg o r more, the contraceptive patch is \\nless efficacious. The contraceptive vaginal ring is a flexible, \\nSilastic ring. The ring releases a constant rate of 15 m g of ethinyl \\nestradiol and 0.120  m g of etonogestrel per day. Each ring is \\nused continuously for 3 weeks and then removed. A new ring \\nThe primary mechanism of action is suppression of ovula -\\ntion; there may be additional efficacy from the effects of the \\nprogestin on cervical mucus and the endometrium. Quick starts \\nare possible, with insertion on the day of presentation once \\npregnancy has been excluded. The implant does not need to \\nbe inserted at any particular time in the menstrual cycle. The \\nmost common side effect is the irregular and unpredictable \\nbleeding pattern that is most common in the first 3 months \\nof use. Adolescents should be counseled regarding the \\nexpected change in bleeding. Continuation rates of use among \\nadolescents of this method at 1 year have been reported at  \\nover 80%.\\nIntrauterine Devices\\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs) are inserted into the uterus, where \\nthey release either copper ions or levonorgestrel. Either IUD \\nmethod is safe for adolescents. A sterile foreign-body reaction \\nin the uterine cavity is a common mechanism of action of both \\nIUD methods. In addition, the copper IUD impairs sperm \\nfunction and fertilization, while the levonorgestrel IUDs induce \\nan atrophic endometrium as well as thickening cervical mucus. \\nThe copper IUD has the longest approval for duration of use \\nat 10 years; however, it may increase the amount and duration \\nof bleeding as well as dysmenorrhea. The levonorgestrel-releasing \\nintrauterine systems contain differing amounts of levonorgestrel \\n(13.5 m g or 52  m g), with durations of use of 3 years and 5 \\nyears respectively. All levonorgestrel IUDs affect bleeding \\npatterns. The 52-mg products decrease menstrual flow, resulting \\nin amenorrhea in approximately 20% of users at 1 year. They \\nare used therapeutically for heavy menstrual bleeding and \\ndysmenorrhea. The 13.5-mg product decreases menstrual flow \\nbut with less achievement of amenorrhea. All IUDs are highly \\neffective (failure rates of <1%), with even lower failure rates of \\nlevonorgestrel IUDs. Although a small increased risk of pelvic \\ninflammatory disease exists for 21 days after insertion of an \\nIUD, the risk following that transient period lowers to the level \\nof an adolescent without an IUD for the remainder of use. \\nAdolescents should be screened for STIs at the time of IUD \\ninsertion, with treatment provided as soon as possible for \\npositive results or if there is a concern for compliance at the \\ntime of IUD insertion. Insertion in nulliparous women can be \\naided by the use of a paracervical block. The use of condoms \\nshould be encouraged to reduce the risk of STIs.\\nHormonal Injections\\nDepo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is available in \\ntwo formulations: intramuscular injection of 150  m g every \\n12-14 weeks or 104  m g/0.65  mL f or subcutaneous use every \\n12-14 weeks. The primary mechanism of action is suppression \\nof ovulation with a secondary effect of progestin on cervi-\\ncal mucus. Progestin-only contraception is associated with \\nmenstrual irregularities (70% amenorrhea and 30% frequent \\nmenstrual bleeding). Weight gain on DMPA is unpredictable. \\nThe average weight gain is 5 pounds in the first year. Individu-\\nals who gain more than 5% of weight early on are at greater \\nrisk of excess weight gain overall. Current information on the \\nconcerns of possible effect on bone mineral density suggests \\nreversibility of effect. The potential impact on bone density \\nshould not prevent health care providers from prescribing \\nDMPA methods to adolescents after appropriate counseling. \\nContinuation of DMPA in adolescents at 1 year is less than with  \\nother LARCs.\\nTABLE 69.4 Absolute Contraindications to Combined \\nHormonal Contraceptives\\nSmoking\\tand \\tage \\t>35\\tyr \\tand \\t>15\\tcigarettes/day\\nHypertension\\t(systolic \\t≥160 mm Hg or diastolic ≥100 mm Hg) or \\nassociated\\twith \\tvascular \\tdisease\\nCurrent\\tvenous \\tthromboembolic \\tdisease \\t(not \\ton \\ttherapy \\tor \\ton \\t\\ntherapy\\tfor \\t>3\\tmo \\twith \\thigh \\trisk \\tof \\trecurrence)\\nHistory\\tof \\tvenous \\tthromboembolic \\tdisease \\tat \\thigh \\trisk \\tof \\t\\nrecurrence\\nMajor\\tsurgery \\twith \\tprolonged \\timmobilization\\nIschemic heart disease\\nPeripartum\\tcardiomyopathy \\twith \\tmoderately \\tor \\tseverely \\timpaired \\t\\ncardiac\\tfunction \\tor \\twithin \\t6 \\tmo \\tof \\tpregnancy\\nComplicated solid organ transplantation\\nComplicated\\tvalvular \\theart \\tdisease \\t(pulmonary \\thypertension, \\t\\natrial\\tfibrillation, \\thistory \\tof \\tsubacute \\tbacterial \\tendocarditis)\\nMigraine\\twith \\tfocal \\tneurological \\tsymptoms \\tany \\tage\\nBreast cancer (current)\\nDiabetes\\twith \\tretinopathy/nephropathy/neuropathy \\tor \\tduration \\tof \\t\\ndiabetes\\tof \\t>20\\tyr \\tduration\\nSevere\\tcirrhosis\\nLiver\\ttumor \\t(adenoma \\tor \\thepatoma)\\nAcute hepatitis\\nSystemic\\tlupus \\twith \\tpositive \\tantiphospholipid \\tantibody \\tlevels \\t(or \\t\\nunknown\\tlevels)\\nThrombogenic\\tmutations\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Polyure-\\nthane and other nonlatex male condoms have an increased \\nrisk of breakage and slippage. Condoms may be chosen by \\nindividuals who have infrequent intercourse. Latex and poly-\\nurethane condoms are available over the counter without the \\nneed for a physician visit or prescription. The female condom \\nis an additional barrier method made of polyurethane that \\naffords females more control, but adolescents usually do not \\nconsider it aesthetically pleasing. Condoms are commonly \\nrecommended in the context of “dual” protection for adolescents. \\nAny adolescent using barrier methods should be counseled \\nregarding emergency contraceptive (EC) options.\\nSponge, Caps, and Diaphragm\\nThe vaginal sponge is a spermicide-impregnated synthetic sponge \\nthat is effective for 24 hours of intercourse. The sponge has higher \\nrates of failure compared with other methods of contraception. \\nNonoxynol-9 (the spermicide) increases the risk of vaginal \\nand cervical irritation or abrasion and therefore also the risk \\nof transmission of HIV . The cervical cap, made of silicone, is \\navailable in several sizes; the choice of size depends on the \\nuser’s pregnancy history. The cap is placed on the cervix by \\nthe user before intercourse. This method is technically difficult, \\nespecially for an adolescent. The diaphragm is an intravaginal \\nbarrier method used in conjunction with a gel. The user must \\nbe fitted for a diaphragm by a health care provider, but it is \\ntechnically simpler to use than the cap because the edges go \\ninto the vaginal fornices. The efficacy of the diaphragm and \\nthe cap was studied with use of a spermicidal gel, which is no \\nlonger available. Thus the efficacy of these methods with use \\nof an acid-buffering lubricant to inhibit sperm motility is not \\nknown. All of these methods need to be left in place for 6 hours \\nafter the last act of intercourse for optimal efficacy.\\nEmergency Postcoital Contraception\\nEmergency postcoital contraception should be discussed at \\nevery visit. A prescription should be given in advance of need \\nwhen no over-the-counter access is available. Emergency \\ncontraception (EC) reduces the risk of pregnancy after unpro-\\ntected intercourse. Indications and contraindications to \\nemergency postcoital contraception are listed in Table 69.6. \\nThere are several forms of EC. The copper IUD can be inserted \\nup to 7 days from the act of unprotected intercourse; it is the \\nmost effective EC method with an efficacy of greater than 99%. \\nLevonorgestrel 0.75 m g, two tablets given once (total dose of \\n1.5 m g), is approved for use up to 72 hours after unprotected \\nintercourse with efficacy up to 5 days. Effectiveness is higher \\nthe earlier the method is used after unprotected intercourse. \\nWomen with a BMI >25 kg/m2 may experience reduced efficacy, \\nbut regardless of BMI, hormonal EC methods may retain \\neffectiveness and should not be withheld if a copper IUD EC \\nis not available or acceptable. Any CHC pill may be prescribed \\nto deliver two doses of the equivalent of 100  m g of ethinyl \\nestradiol and 500 µg of levonorgestrel 12 hours apart. The CHC \\nmethod is associated with significantly more nausea and \\nTABLE 69.5 Relative Contraindications to Combined \\nHormonal Contraceptives\\n<1\\tmo \\tpostpartum \\tand \\tbreast \\tfeeding \\tor \\t<21\\tdays \\tpostpartum \\t\\nnot\\tbreast \\tfeeding\\nAdequately\\tcontrolled \\thypertension\\nHypertension\\tadequately \\tcontrolled \\tor \\tsystolic \\t140-159 \\tmm \\tHg, \\t\\ndiastolic 90-99 mm Hg\\nMigraine without aura and age > 35\\tyr\\nCurrently\\tsymptomatic \\tgallbladder \\tdisease \\tmedically \\ttreated\\nPeripartum\\tcardiomyopathy, \\tnormal \\tor \\tmildly \\timpaired \\tcardiac \\t\\nfunction >6\\tmo \\tfrom \\tpregnancy\\nHistory\\tof \\tcombined \\toral \\tcontraceptive–related \\tcholestasis\\nHistory\\tof \\tmalabsorptive \\tbariatric \\tsurgery \\tprocedure\\nPast\\tbreast \\tcancer \\twith \\tno \\tevidence \\tof \\tcurrent \\tdisease \\tfor \\t5 \\tyr\\nHistory\\tof \\tvenous \\tthromboembolic \\tdisease \\tat \\tlow \\trisk \\tfor \\t\\nrecurrence\\nAcute\\tvenous \\tthromboembolic \\tevent \\ton \\ttreatment \\tfor \\tat \\tleast \\t\\n3\\tmo \\tat \\tlow \\trisk \\tof \\trecurrence\\nSmoking\\t> age 35 and < 15\\tcigarettes \\tper \\tday\\nDrug\\tinteractions \\t(ritonavir-boosted \\tprotease \\tinhibitors, \\tcertain \\t\\nanticonvulsants\\t(phenytoin, \\tcarbamazepine, \\tprimidone, \\t\\nlamotrigine,\\ttopiramate, \\tbarbiturates), \\trifampicin, \\trifabutin \\t\\ntherapy)\\nis inserted 7 days later. Any CHC can be used in an extended \\nfashion by missing hormone-free days to induce long intervals \\nbetween withdrawal bleeding.\\nAfter a history and physical examination, CHCs can be started \\non the first day of the next menstrual period or as a “Quick \\nStart. ” The Quick Start method refers to starting on any day \\nof the cycle, usually on the day of the visit to the health care \\nprovider, as long as pregnancy has been ruled out. Blood pressure \\nmeasurement to rule out preexisting hypertension should be \\nobtained before prescribing a CHC. Initially the adolescent \\nshould be seen monthly to reinforce good contraceptive use \\nand safer sex.\\nInitial side effects, such as nausea, breast tenderness, and \\nbreakthrough bleeding, are common and usually transient. CHCs \\ndo not generally cause weight gain. Usually 3-4 months on one \\nCHC are needed to determine acceptability. If there is break-\\nthrough bleeding, the physician should determine compliance \\nwith the method (especially with oral pills) before changing \\nmethods. Adolescents should be taught the appropriate response \\nto missed doses. Health care providers usually suggest the use \\nof additional contraception in the first month.\\nProgestogen-Only Pill\\nAlthough not as widely used as CHCs, the progestin-only pill, \\nnorethindrone, is a safe and effective form of contraception \\nwhen used consistently. It is supplied in packages of 28 tablets, \\neach containing norethindrone with no hormone-free interval. \\nIt prevents pregnancy through reduced volume, increased \\nviscosity, and altered molecular structure of cervical mucus, \\nresulting in little or no sperm penetration.

Clothes, especially undergarments, \\nneed to be placed in a paper bag for drying (plastic holds \\nhumidity, which allows organisms to grow, destroying forensic \\nevidence). The patient should be inspected for bruising and \\nbites as well as oral, genital, and anal trauma. Photographs \\nare the best record to document injuries. Specimens should be \\nobtained from the fingernails, mouth, vagina, pubic hair, and \\nanus. The sexual assault kit provides materials to obtain DNA \\nfrom semen, saliva, blood, fingernail scrapings, and pubic hair. \\nA wet mount of vaginal fluids shows the presence or absence \\nof sperm under the microscope. Cultures for STIs should be \\ntaken but are often negative (unless the patient was previously \\ninfected) because 72 hours are needed for the bacterial load to be \\nsufficient for a culture. Blood should be drawn for baseline HIV \\nand syphilis (Venereal Disease Research Laboratories [VDRL] \\ntest). All materials must be maintained in a “chain of evidence” \\nthat cannot be called into question in court.\\nTherapy after a rape includes prophylaxis for EC and STI and, \\nif indicated, hepatitis immune globulin and hepatitis vaccine. \\nA single oral dose of cefixime, 400  m g, and azithromycin, \\n1 g , treats Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. An alternative \\nregimen is a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone, 125 m g, \\nwith a single oral dose of azithromycin, 1  g . For prophylaxis \\nagainst bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas, a single oral dose \\nof metronidazole, 2 g , is recommended. If the HIV status of the \\nperpetrator is known and is positive, exposure to blood, genital \\nsecretions, or other potentially infective fluids occurred, and the \\nindividual is seeking assistance within 72 hours, a 28-day course \\nof highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered \\nand initiated as soon as possible. If the assailant’s HIV status \\nis unknown, an individualized approach should be taken in \\ndeciding on postexposure prophylaxis, assessing for risk of \\ninfection (trauma at time of assault, prevalence of HIV in the \\nregion, nature of exposure) and the patient’s wishes. Consider \\nconsulting an HIV specialist for advice. Repeat cultures, wet \\nmounts, and a pregnancy test should be performed 3 weeks after \\nthe assault, followed by serology for syphilis, hepatitis, and HIV \\nat 12 weeks. Long-term sequelae are common; patients should \\nbe offered immediate and ongoing psychological support, such \\nas that offered by local rape crisis services.\\nCHAPTER 70 \\nEating Disorders\\nEating disorders are common chronic diseases in adolescents, \\nespecially in females. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \\nMental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V), classifies these as \\npsychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis in young adolescents (pre-\\ngrowth spurt, premenstrual) may not follow the typical diag-\\nnostic criteria (Table 70.1).\\nANOREXIA NERVOSA\\nThe prevalence of anorexia nervosa is 1.5% in teenage girls. \\nThe female-to-male ratio is approximately 20  :  1, a nd the \\nvomiting than the progestin-only regimen and is less effective. \\nThe antiprogestin mifepristone is an effective postcoital con-\\ntraceptive in a 30 m g dose; however, it is not approved for this \\nuse in the United States. When women are prescribed or use \\nemergency contraception, a pregnancy test should be completed \\nif normal menstrual bleeding does not occur within 21 days \\nwith Progestin or IUD methods or by 28 days with CHC method. \\nY oung women who use EC should be counseled on alternative \\ncontraceptive methods.\\nCoitus Interruptus\\nWithdrawal is a common method of birth control used by \\nsexually active adolescents. It is ineffective because sperm are \\nreleased into the vagina before ejaculation, and withdrawal \\nmay occur after ejaculation has begun.\\nRhythm Method (Periodic Coital Abstinence)\\nThe rhythm method is the practice of periodic abstinence just \\nbefore, during, and after ovulation. This method requires the \\nuser to have an accurate knowledge of her cycle, awareness of \\nclues indicating ovulation, and discipline. Adolescents tend to \\nhave unpredictable cycles and, consequently, less predictable \\novulation, so it is difficult to determine with any accuracy a \\ntime of the month that can be considered completely safe.\\nOral and Anal Sex\\nSome adolescents engage in oral or anal sex because they believe \\nthat it eliminates the need for contraception. Many do not \\nconsider this activity as “having sex. ” Condoms generally are \\nnot used during oral or anal sex, but the risk of acquiring an \\nSTI is still present. Adolescents should be asked specifically \\nabout nonvaginal forms of sexual activity. Adolescents who \\nengage in oral and anal sex require STI and HIV counseling \\nand screening.\\nRAPE\\nRape is a legal term for nonconsensual intercourse. Almost \\nhalf of rape victims are adolescents, and the perpetrator is \\nknown in 50% of cases.

Binge-eating episodes \\nand the loss of control over eating often occur in young women \\nwho are slightly overweight with a history of dieting.\\nNutritional, educational, and self-monitoring techniques \\nare used to increase awareness of the maladaptive behavior, \\nfollowing which efforts are made to change the eating behavior. \\nPatients with bulimia nervosa may respond to antidepressant \\ntherapy, which may help impulse control and/or depression. \\nThere may be family histories of affective disorders. Patients feel \\nembarrassed, guilty, and ashamed of their actions. Attempted \\nsuicide and completed suicide (5%) are important concerns.\\nCHAPTER 71 \\nSubstance Abuse\\nThe age at which street drugs are first used is decreasing (now <12 \\nyears), and females are overtaking males in terms of substance \\nuse. Ninety percent of adult smokers begin their habit during the \\nadolescent years. Marijuana and stimulant drug use is increas-\\ning. Inhalant use (glue solvents, aerosol products) is prevalent \\namong younger adolescents and in Native Americans. The use \\nof club drugs by adolescents from upper-income groups at rave \\nparties (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [“ecstasy”]) \\nand so-called date-rape drugs (gamma-hydroxybutyrate or \\nflunitrazepam [Rohypnol]) has risen sharply. Anabolic steroid \\nuse has increased among adolescent boys seeking enhanced \\nathletic performance.\\nA history of drug use should be taken in a nonjudgmental and \\nsupportive manner and should include the types of substances \\nas well as the frequency, timing, circumstances, and outcomes \\nof substance use. Table 71.1 is a helpful screening tool. There are \\nfew physical findings even with chronic adolescent substance use. \\nAn adolescent may present in an overdose or in an intoxicated \\nstate, or in a psychosis triggered by a hallucinogen, such as \\nphencyclidine (“angel dust”).

Other signs \\ninclude fine hair on the face and trunk (lanugo-like hair), rough \\nand scaly skin, bradycardia, hypothermia, decreased body mass \\nindex, erosion of tooth enamel (due to acid from emesis), and \\nacrocyanosis of the hands and feet. Signs of hyperthyroidism \\nshould not be present (see Chapter 175). The diagnostic criteria \\nfor anorexia nervosa are listed in Table 70.2.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nTreatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, including a \\nfeeding program as well as individual and family therapy. Feeding \\nis accomplished through voluntary intake of regular foods, \\nnutritional formula orally, or by nasogastric tube. When vital \\nsigns are stable, discussion and negotiation of a detailed treat-\\nment contract with the patient and the parents are essential. \\nThe first step is to restore body weight. Hospitalization may \\nbe necessary (Table 70.3). When 80% of normal weight is \\nachieved, the patient is given freedom to gain weight at a \\npersonal pace. The prognosis includes a 3-5% mortality (suicide, \\nmalnutrition) rate, the development of bulimic symptoms (30% \\nof individuals), and persistent anorexia nervosa syndrome (20% \\nof individuals).\\nBULIMIA NERVOSA\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Verbsky\\nCHAPTER 72 \\nImmunological Assessment\\nThe major components of host defense include anatomical \\nbarriers, and the innate and adaptive immune systems. Integrity \\nof the anatomical and mucociliary barrier (i.e., skin and \\nmucous membranes) is essential for protection against infection, \\nand defects in this barrier function can lead to infections (Table \\n72.1). The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense \\nagainst pathogens, responding rapidly but nonspecifically before \\nthe development of the more versatile adaptive immune system. \\nThe innate immune system includes soluble factors, including \\nacute-phase proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and complement, \\nas well as cellular components, including neutrophils, monocytes/\\nmacrophages, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer (NK) \\ncells. The adaptive immune system is made up of T and B \\nlymphocytes and their effector molecules (Table 72.2).\\nRecognition of pathogens by the innate immune system \\nis facilitated by receptors on macrophages, NK cells, and \\nneutrophils that recognize conserved pathogen motifs called \\npathogen-associated molecular patterns (P AMPs), includ-\\ning lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic \\nacid of gram-positive bacteria, mannans of yeast, and specific \\nnucleotide sequences of bacterial and viral DNA. Recognition \\nof PAMPs by the innate immune system leads to the production \\nof cytokines that initiate inflammation and induce an acute \\nphase response (e.g., C-reactive protein, mannose-binding lectin, \\ncomplement) and chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells, \\nultimately resulting in the activation of the adaptive immune \\nsystem. Complement protein activation on pathogens facilitates \\ntheir uptake by phagocytic cells or results in lysis of pathogens. \\nPolymorphonuclear neutrophils ingest pyogenic bacteria and \\nsome fungi. Macrophages are effective in killing facultative \\nintracellular organisms such as Mycobacterium, Toxoplasma, \\nSalmonella, and Legionella. NK lymphocytes mediate cytotoxic \\nactivity against virus-infected cells and cancer cells.\\nThe key features of the adaptive immune system are antigen \\nspecificity and the development of immunological memory, \\nproduced by expansion and maturation of antigen-specific T \\ncells and B cells. Antibodies (immunoglobulin) produced by B \\ncells neutralize toxins released by pathogens, opsonize pathogens \\nto facilitate uptake by phagocytic cells, activate complement \\ncausing cytolysis of the pathogen, and direct NK cells to kill \\ninfected cells through antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. T cells \\nkill virus-infected cells and cancer cells, activate macrophage \\nto kill intracellular pathogens, and deliver the necessary signals \\nfor B-cell antibody synthesis and memory B-cell formation. \\nImmunodeficiency can result from defects in one or more \\ncomponents of innate or adaptive immunity, leading to recur-\\nrent, opportunistic, or life-threatening infections.

Deep-seated abscesses and \\ninfections with Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and \\nAspergillus suggest a disorder of neutrophil function, such as \\nchronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Delayed separation of \\nthe umbilical cord, especially in the presence of omphalitis and \\nlater onset periodontal disease, in addition to poorly formed \\nabscesses, indicates leukocyte adhesion deficiency. Neisserial \\ninfections or early onset autoimmunity may suggest a comple-\\nment defect.\\nAge of onset of symptoms can be helpful in defining an \\nimmune deficiency, although significant variability does occur. \\nNeutrophil defects (e.g., congenital neutropenia, leukocyte adhe-\\nsion deficiency) typically present in the first several months of \\nlife. Antibody defects (e.g., agammaglobulinemia) and T-cell \\ndefects (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency [SCID]) \\ntypically present after 3 months of life after maternal antibody \\nlevels have waned. Presentation with symptoms of an antibody \\ndeficiency in adolescence or young adulthood suggests common \\nvariable immunodeficiency (CVID) rather than congenital \\nagammaglobulinemia, although milder phenotypes of primary \\nimmunodeficiency diseases are relatively rare individually, but \\ntogether they cause significant chronic disease, morbidity, and \\nmortality (Table 72.3).\\nHISTORY\\nThe frequency, severity, and location of infections and the \\npathogens involved can help differentiate infections in a \\nnormal host from infections in an immunodeficient patient \\n(see Table 72.3).

Patients often have skin disease similar to eczema, \\npossibly related to graft versus host disease (GVHD) from \\nengraftment of maternal lymphocytes, which usually is not \\nfatal. Patients with SCID are extremely susceptible to fatal \\nGVHD from lymphocytes in blood transfusions and can be \\ninfected by cytomegalovirus-positive blood products. Patients \\nwith T-cell disorders should always receive irradiated, leukopoor, \\nCMV negative blood products.\\nX-linked SCID, the most common form, is caused by \\nmutations in the gene on chromosome Xq13.1 coding for the \\ncommon gamma chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, \\nIL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptors. Affected patients have no \\nT cells or NK cells in the peripheral blood but have normal \\nnumbers of B cells. Ig levels are low or undetectable because \\nthere are no CD4 T cells to stimulate B cells. The defect in \\nT-cell development results from a failure of signaling via the \\nIL-7 receptor, and IL-15 is required for NK-cell development. \\nThere are many causes of autosomal recessive SCID. Defects \\nin Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), which binds to the common gamma \\nchain, results in a similar phenotype as X-linked SCID. Defects \\nSevere combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized \\nby a profound lack of T-cell numbers or function, and B-cell \\ndysfunction resulting from the absence of B cells from the gene \\ndefect itself, or secondary to lack of T-cell function (see Table \\n73.2). T cells develop from bone marrow−derived precursors in \\nthe thymus (see Fig. 73.2), where they undergo several stages \\nof development characterized by DNA recombination of the \\nvariable region of T-cell antigen receptor genes to generate a \\ndiverse T-cell receptor repertoire. A process of positive selection \\noccurs in the thymus to select thymocytes with antigen receptors \\nthat can interact with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) \\nmolecules to ensure their survival (see Fig. 73.2). Thymocytes \\ndifferentiate into CD4 or CD8 T cells if they interact with \\nMHC class II or class I molecules, respectively. Some of the \\npositively selected thymocytes, however, have antigen receptors \\nthat recognize self-antigens presented by MHC molecules in the \\nthymus. These cells are deleted in the thymus by a process of \\nnegative selection. Positive selection and negative selection in \\nthe thymus ensure that the mature T cells that leave the thymus \\ncan function with the individual’s MHC molecules and recognize \\na multitude of foreign antigens without mounting autoimmune \\nresponses. SCID can result from any specific genetic mutation \\nthat interferes with T-cell development in the thymus or T-cell \\nfunction in the periphery.\\nTABLE 73.2 Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases\\nDISORDER GENETICS ONSET MANIFESTATIONS PATHOGENESIS ASSOCIATED FEATURES\\nHyper-IgM syndrome \\n(see Table 73.1)\\nX-linked, AR First year Sinopulmonary infections, \\nopportunistic infections, \\nPneumocystis jiroveci\\nDefect in CD40 ligand \\n(X-linked) or CD40 (AR)\\nNeutropenia, liver disease, \\ncancer\\nDiGeorge anomaly 22q11.2 (or \\n10p) deletion\\nNewborn, \\nearly infancy\\nHypocalcemic tetany, \\npyogenic infections, partial \\nor complete T-cell deficiency\\nHypoplasia of third and \\nfourth pharyngeal \\npouch\\nCongenital heart disease \\n(aortic arch anomalies), \\nhypoparathyroidism, \\nmicrognathia, hypertelorism\\nSevere combined \\nimmunodeficiency \\n(T− B+ SCID)\\nX-linked; AR 1-3 mo Candidiasis, all types of \\ninfections, failure to thrive, \\nchronic diarrhea\\nMutation in IL-2Rγ \\nchain, Jak3 kinase, \\nZAP-70, IL-7Ra, CD3 \\nsubunits\\nGVHD from maternal-fetal \\ntransfusions, severe GVHD \\nfrom nonirradiated blood \\ntransfusion\\nSevere combined \\nimmunodeficiency \\n(T− B− SCID)\\nAR 1-3 mo Same as T− B+ SCID Mutation in RAG1/2, \\nArtemis, ADA/PNP \\ndeficiency\\nSame as T− B+ SCID\\nADA deficiency: chondro-\\nosseous dysplasia\\nPNP deficiency: neurological \\ndisorders\\nOmenn syndrome AR 1-3 mo Same as T− B− SCID, \\nexfoliative erythroderma, \\nlymphadenopathy, \\nhepatosplenomegaly\\nHypomorphic mutations \\nin SCID-causing genes \\n(RAG1/2, Artemis)\\nRestricted T-cell receptor \\nheterogeneity, eosinophilia, \\nelevated IgE\\nReticular dysgenesis \\n(T− B− SCID)\\nAR 1-3 mo Same as T− B− SCID Defective maturation of \\ncommon stem cells due \\nto AK2 mutations\\nAgammaglobulinemia, \\nalymphocytosis, \\nagranulocytosis\\nBare lymphocyte \\nsyndrome (MHC \\nclass I deficiency)\\nAR First decade Sinopulmonary infections Mutation in TAP1 or \\nTAP2 (transporter \\nassociated with antigen \\nprocessing)\\nDecreased CD8 T cells, \\nchronic lung inflammation\\nBare lymphocyte \\nsyndrome (MHC \\nclass II deficiency)\\nAR Early infancy Respiratory tract infections, \\nchronic diarrhea, viral \\ninfections\\nMutations in CIITA, \\nRFX5, RFXAP, and \\nRFX-B (DNA binding \\nfactors)\\nDecreased CD4 T cells, \\nautoimmune disease\\nADA, Adenosine deaminase; AR, autosomal recessive; GVHD, graft versus host disease; IL, interleukin; IL-2Rγ, interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain; MHC, major \\nhistocompatibility complex; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; T− B+, T− cells absent and B cells present; T− B−, T \\ncells absent and B cells absent.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Deficiency of this protein \\nresults in elevated levels of IgE and IgA, decreased IgM, poor \\nresponses to polysaccharide antigens, waning T-cell function, \\nand profound thrombocytopenia. Opportunistic infections \\nand autoimmune cytopenias become problematic in older \\nchildren. Isolated X-linked thrombocytopenia  also results \\nfrom mutations of the identical gene. One third of patients \\nwith Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome die as a result of hemorrhage, \\nand two thirds die as a result of recurrent infection caused by \\nbacteria, cytomegalovirus, P . jiroveci (carinii), or herpes simplex \\nvirus. Stem cell transplantation has corrected the immunological \\nand hematological problems in some patients.\\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is a syndrome caused by the ataxia-\\ntelangiectasia, mutated (ATM) gene on chromosome 11q22.3 \\n(see Table 73.3). Patients have cutaneous and conjunctival telan-\\ngiectasias and progressive cerebellar ataxia with degeneration of \\nPurkinje cells. IgA deficiency, IgG2 subclass deficiency of variable \\nseverity, low IgE levels, and variably depressed T-cell function \\nmay be seen. The normal function of the ATM gene appears to \\nbe involved in detecting DNA damage and blocking cell growth \\ndivision until the damage is repaired. Ataxia-telangiectasia cells \\nare exquisitely sensitive to irradiation, and malignancies includ-\\ning leukemia or lymphoma can occur. Diabetes also may be \\npresent, and sexual maturation is delayed.

In addition there is a variety of defects that affect \\nDNA recombination in T and B cells, including two genes called \\nrecombinase activating gene (RAG)1 and RAG2 as well as other \\ngenes important in DNA excision and repair such as Artemis. \\nDefects in any of the genes that abolish DNA recombination or \\nDNA repair result in autosomal recessive SCID with no T cells \\nor B cells present. Mutations in RAG1, RAG2, or Artemis that \\npreserve limited function result in Omenn syndrome, a variant \\nform of SCID that is characterized by exfoliative erythroderma, \\nlymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, marked eosinophilia, \\nelevated serum IgE, and impaired T-cell function. Patients with \\nOmenn syndrome have T cells in the periphery, but these T \\ncells have a limited repertoire.\\nDeficiencies in adenosine deaminase (ADA)  and purine \\nnucleoside phosphorylase, two enzymes involved in the \\npurine salvage pathway, also result in SCID. Accumulation of \\nnucleoside substrates or their metabolic products in the plasma \\nand urine is toxic to lymphocytes, including T, B, and NK cells. \\nMost patients exhibit severe infection early in life, although \\nthe diagnosis in patients with partial enzyme function may \\nnot be established until after 5 years of age or, occasionally, \\nin adulthood. Patients with late-onset diagnosis are generally \\nlymphopenic; they may have B cells and normal total Ig levels \\nbut little functional antibody.\\nBare lymphocyte syndrome results from defects in transcrip-\\ntion factors that regulate expression of MHC class II molecules \\nor genes that affect transport of antigen peptides, which leads to \\nthe absence of either MHC class I or MHC class II molecules. \\nLymphoid tissue and B cells may be present in normal amounts, \\nbut CD4 T cells are decreased or absent in class II deficiency, \\nwhereas CD8 cells are decreased or absent in class I deficiency. \\nSome patients may have normal numbers of CD4 or CD8 T \\ncells, but none of the T cells are functional because peptide \\nantigens cannot be presented to T cells.\\nDiGeorge syndrome, also known as velocardiofacial syn-\\ndrome or CATCH 22 syndrome (cardiac anomalies, abnormal \\nfacies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia), is the \\nresult of dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal \\npouches, resulting in hypoplasia of the thymus required for \\nT-cell maturation. Most, but not all, patients with DiGeorge \\nsyndrome have a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2. DiGeorge \\nsyndrome is classically characterized by hypocalcemic tetany, \\nconotruncal and aortic arch anomalies, and increased infections. \\nThe diagnosis is established by fluorescent in situ hybridization \\nor a polymerase chain reaction with a DNA probe to detect \\ndeletions in chromosome 22q11.2. Most patients have partial \\nimmune defects with low T-cell numbers and function that \\ngenerally improve with age. Severe T-cell deficiency is rare, \\nbut when it occurs, it presents similarly to SCID due to a \\ncomplete lack of T cells.

IVIG \\ntherapy should be monitored by regularly measuring trough \\nIg levels and, more important, the patient’s clinical course. \\nPatients who continue to have recurrent infections, especially \\nin the last week before the administration of IVIG, may require \\nhigher doses or more frequent administration. A combination \\nof prophylactic antibiotics and Ig replacement therapy may be \\nindicated in patients who continue to have recurrent infections. \\nComplications of IVIG therapy include transfusion reactions \\nwith chills, fever, and myalgias. They usually can be prevented \\nin subsequent infusions by pretreatment with an antihistamine, \\nan antipyretic, and by a slower rate of infusion. Headache from \\naseptic meningitis can develop after IVIG therapy, usually in \\nthe first 24 hours. It most often responds to treatment with \\nibuprofen. Allergic reactions to IVIG can occur in patients \\nwith absent IgA, although these reactions are rare. Subcutane-\\nous administration of Ig has fewer adverse effects but may be \\ncomplicated by local reactions at the site(s) of infusion. The \\nrisk of transmission of infectious agents, despite preparation \\nfrom large numbers of selected donors, is extremely low.\\nTherapy for severe T-cell disorders is stem cell transplanta-\\ntion, preferably from a human leukocyte antigen–matched sibling \\n(see Chapter 76). Ig replacement provides passive antibody-\\nmediated immunity. Some patients continue to have poor B-cell \\nfunction after stem cell transplantation and require lifelong Ig \\nreplacement therapy. GVHD, in which the transplanted cells \\ninitiate an immune response against the host tissues, is the \\nmain complication of stem cell transplantation. Patients with \\nthe ADA deficiency form of SCID who lack matched sibling \\ndonors can receive repeated intramuscular replacement doses \\nof ADA, stabilized by coupling to polyethylene glycol. Gene \\ntherapy has been performed in patients with common gamma \\nchain deficiency and ADA deficiency by transfer of a normal \\ngene into bone marrow stem cells, which are infused into the \\npatient. Gene therapy for common gamma chain deficiency \\nwas successful in most of the treated patients; however, it was \\ncomplicated by the development of leukemia in some patients. \\nNewer viral vectors have been developed without the risk of \\nleukemia, making gene therapy a likely option in the future \\nfor patients with SCID.\\nPREVENTION AND NEWBORN SCREENING\\nPopulation-based screening programs for SCID are underway \\nbecause early identification of SCID prior to infectious complica-\\ntions improves outcomes. Polymerase chain reaction amplifica-\\ntion of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) formed during \\nT-cell receptor recombination can be performed on newborn \\nscreening blood spots to detect severe T-cell lymphopenia. \\nNewborn screening for TRECs has been shown to detect SCID \\nat birth, and this test has been recommended for universal \\nscreening.\\nCHAPTER 74 \\nNeutrophil Disorders\\nNeutrophils play important roles in immunity and wound \\nhealing; their primary function is ingesting and killing \\npathogens. Neutrophil disorders can result from deficient \\ncell numbers or defective function (Table 74.1). Patients with \\nneutrophil disorders are susceptible to a variety of bacterial \\ninfections and certain fungi. Suggestive signs include mucous \\nmembrane infections (gingivitis), abscesses in the skin and \\nviscera, lymphadenitis, poor wound healing, delayed umbilical \\ncord separation, or absence of pus. Neutrophils develop in the \\nbone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells by the action of \\nseveral colony-stimulating factors, including stem cell factor, \\ngranulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte \\ncolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and interleukin-3. On \\nleaving the bone marrow, mature neutrophils are found in \\nthe circulation or reside in the marginating pool. Adhesion \\nmolecules are necessary for neutrophils to roll and adhere to \\nvascular endothelium and extravasate from the blood into sites \\nof infection, where they phagocytose and kill pathogens, espe-\\ncially those coated by complement or antibodies. Chemotactic \\nfactors, including the complement fragment C5a, interleukin-8, \\nand bacterial formulated peptides, mobilize neutrophils to \\nenter tissues and sites of infections.

Neutropenia \\nis defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than \\n1,500/mm3 for white children 1 year of age or older. African \\nAmerican children normally have lower total white blood cell \\nand neutrophil counts. The effect of neutropenia depends on its \\nseverity. The susceptibility to infection is minimally increased \\nuntil the ANC is less than 1,000/mm3. Most patients do well \\nwith an ANC greater than 500/mm3. At these levels, localized \\ninfections are more common than generalized bacteremia. \\nSerious bacterial infections are more common with an ANC \\nless than 200/mm3. The major types of infections associated with \\nneutropenia are cellulitis, pharyngitis, gingivitis, lymphadenitis, \\nabscesses (cutaneous or perianal), enteritis (typhlitis), and \\npneumonia. The sites of the infection usually are colonized \\nheavily with normal bacterial flora that becomes invasive in \\nthe presence of neutropenia. Neutropenia may be congenital \\nor acquired (Table 74.2) and may be associated with specific \\ndiseases, especially infections (Table 74.3), or result from drug \\nreactions (Table 74.4).\\nThere are several forms of congenital neutropenia. Severe \\ncongenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) is an autosomal \\nrecessive disorder in which myeloid cells fail to mature beyond \\nthe early stages of the promyelocyte due to mutations in the \\nHAX-1 gene. The peripheral blood may show an impressive \\nmonocytosis. Although endogenous G-CSF levels are increased, \\nexogenous G-CSF produces a rise in the neutrophil count, \\nimproving the care of these children. Acute myeloid leukemia has \\ndeveloped in a few patients who have survived into adolescence. \\nStem cell transplantation may be curative. Defects in G6PC3, \\nGFI1, and other genes have also been shown to cause severe \\ncongenital neutropenia. Cyclic neutropenia is a stem cell dis-\\norder in which all marrow elements cycle resulting in transient \\nneutropenia. It may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant, \\nrecessive, or sporadic disorder. Because of the short half-life of \\nneutrophils in the blood (6-7 hours) compared to platelets (10 \\ndays) and red blood cells (120 days), neutropenia is the only \\nclinically significant abnormality. The usual cycle is 21 days, with \\nneutropenia lasting 4-6 days, accompanied by monocytosis and \\noften by eosinophilia. Severe, debilitating bone pain is common \\nwhen the neutrophil count is low. G-CSF results in increasing \\nneutrophil numbers and a shorter duration of neutropenia. \\nDefects in ELANE, the gene encoding for neutrophil elastase, \\nhas been found in patients with cyclic neutropenia. Further \\nanalysis has demonstrated ELANE mutations in some cases \\nof severe congenital neutropenia.\\nSevere congenital neutropenia that may be either persistent or \\ncyclic also is a component of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, \\nan autosomal recessive syndrome of pancreatic insufficiency \\naccompanying bone marrow dysfunction. This is a panmyeloid \\ndisorder in which neutropenia is the most prominent manifesta-\\ntion. Metaphyseal dysostosis and dwarfism may occur. Patients \\nusually respond to G-CSF .

Chronic granulomatous disease \\n(CGD) is a disorder of white blood cells that results from defec-\\ntive intracellular killing of bacteria and intracellular pathogens by \\nneutrophils and macrophages because of an inability to activate \\nthe “respiratory burst, ” the catalytic conversion of molecular \\noxygen to superoxide (O2\\n− ). Reduced nicotinamide adenine \\ndinucleotide phosphate oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the \\nrespiratory burst, consists of four subunits: gp91phox, p22 phox, \\np47phox, and p67phox. Defects in any of these enzymes lead to an \\ninability to kill catalase-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus \\naureus and enteric gram-negative bacteria (Burkholderia) and \\nfungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The gp91phox gene \\nis located on chromosome Xp21.1 and is responsible for the most \\ncommon form of the disease. The other gene defects are inherited \\nin an autosomal recessive manner. The chromosome locations \\nfor these genes are 16q24 for p22phox, 7q11.23 for p47 phox, and \\n1q25 for p67 phox. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase also is \\ninvolved in the production of superoxide, and severe forms of \\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency also result in \\nCGD. Patients characteristically have lymphadenopathy, hyper-\\ngammaglobulinemia, hepatosplenomegaly, dermatitis, failure \\nto thrive, anemia, chronic diarrhea, and abscesses. Infections \\noccur in the lungs, the middle ear, gastrointestinal tract, skin, \\nurinary tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bones. Granulomas are \\nprominent and may obstruct the pylorus or ureters.\\nChédiak-Higashi syndrome, an abnormality of secondary \\ngranules, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a muta-\\ntion in a cytoplasmic protein (LYST) thought to be involved \\nin organellar protein trafficking, resulting in a fusion of the \\nprimary and secondary granules in neutrophils. Giant granules \\nare present in many cells, including lymphocytes, platelets, and \\nmelanocytes. Patients usually have partial oculocutaneous \\nalbinism. The defect in Chédiak-Higashi syndrome results in \\ndefective neutrophil and natural killer cell function, leading to \\nrecurrent and sometimes fatal infections with streptococci and \\nstaphylococci. Most patients progress to an accelerated phase \\nassociated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and character-\\nized by a lymphoproliferative syndrome with generalized \\nlymphohistiocytic infiltrates, fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, \\nlymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia. The condition resembles \\nhemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\\nLABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\\nThe evaluation of a neutropenic child depends on clinical signs \\nof infection, family and medication history, age of the patient, \\ncyclic or persistent nature of the condition, signs of bone marrow \\ninfiltration (malignancy or storage disease), and evidence of \\ninvolvement of other cell lines. Neutropenia is confirmed by \\na complete blood count and differential. A bone marrow aspirate \\nand biopsy may be necessary to determine whether the neu-\\ntropenia is due to a failure of production in the bone marrow, \\ninfiltration of the bone marrow, or loss of neutrophils in the \\nperiphery. Antineutrophil antibodies help diagnose autoimmune \\nneutropenia.\\nNeutrophil chemotactic defects can be excluded by the \\npresence of neutrophils at the site of infection. The Rebuck \\nskin window is a 4-hour in vivo test for neutrophil chemotaxis \\nthat is not performed routinely by most laboratories. In vitro \\nstudies of neutrophil migration are available in specialized \\nof the umbilical cord (often 2 months after birth) with attendant \\nomphalitis and sepsis (see Table 74.1). The neutrophil count \\nusually is greater than 20,000/mm3 because of failure of the \\nneutrophils to adhere normally to vascular endothelium and \\nto migrate out of blood to the tissues (Fig. 74.1). Cutaneous, \\nrespiratory, and mucosal infections occur. Children with this \\ncondition often have severe gingivitis. Sepsis can lead to death \\nin early childhood. This disorder is transmitted as an autosomal \\nrecessive trait. Stem cell transplantation can be lifesaving.\\nLAD-II results from impairment of neutrophil rolling along \\nthe vascular wall, which is the first step in neutrophil migra -\\ntion into tissues and sites of infection. Rolling is mediated \\nby sialylated and fucosylated tetrasaccharides related to the \\nsialylated Lewis X (S-LeX) blood group found on the surface \\nof neutrophils, monocytes, and activated lymphocytes binding \\nto selectin molecules on vascular endothelium (see Fig. 74.1). \\nLAD-II results from a defect in the FUCT1 protein resulting in \\nabnormal fucose metabolism leading to the absence of S-LeX \\nblood group on the surface of neutrophils and other leukocytes. \\nLAD-III is a rare disorder caused by defects in the KINDLIN-3 \\nprotein resulting in defective neutrophil adhesion as well as \\nplatelet defects. Defective migration of neutrophils has also \\nbeen described in Hyper-IgE syndrome and with mutations \\nin the RAC2 gene (see Chapter 73 and Table 74.1).\\nDisorders of Neutrophil Function\\nS-LeX\\nE-selectin ICAM-1\\nLFA-1\\nFIGURE 74.1 Schematic representation of neutrophil migration from \\nthe vascular space across the vascular endothelium into tissues. \\nNeutrophils bind to selectin (E- or P-selectin) molecules on the surface \\nof vascular endothelium via sialylated and fucosylated tetrasaccharides \\nrelated to the S-LeX blood group found on the surface of neutrophils. \\nThe bound neutrophils roll along the endothelium and become tightly \\nbound by the interaction of the adhesion molecule leukocyte function-\\nassociated antigen type 1 (LFA-1) on the neutrophil and intercellular \\nadhesion molecule type 1 (ICAM-1) on vascular endothelium, allowing \\nneutrophils to move through the endothelium and into the tissue \\nspaces.

The classic pathway is activated by \\nantigen-antibody complexes or by C-reactive protein. The \\nalternative pathway may be activated by C3b generated through \\nclassic complement activation or by spontaneous hydrolysis of \\nC3 on microbial surfaces. The lectin pathway is initiated by \\nthe interaction of mannose-binding lectin with microbial \\ncarbohydrate. Activation of the classic pathway by an antigen-\\nantibody complex is initiated by the binding of C1q to the Fc \\nportion of an antibody molecule in the immune complex. C1r \\nauto-activates and cleaves C1s, which cleaves C4 and then C2, \\nforming the C3 convertase, C4b2a. C4b2a is activated by the \\nlectin pathway when mannose-binding protein binds to sugar \\nresidues on the surface of pathogens, and mannose-binding \\nprotein–associated proteases (MASP) cleave C4 and C2. The \\nalternative pathway is always active at a low level and is amplified \\nwhen active C3 binds to a surface that lacks regulatory proteins. \\nC3b generated from C3 binds to factor B, which is cleaved by \\nfactor D to form the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. \\nProperdin binds to and stabilizes the C3 convertase (see Fig. \\n75.1). The C3 convertase can cleave C3 resulting in further \\nC3b deposition and activation of the alternative pathway that \\nacts as an amplification loop by generating more C3b, or it can \\nform the C5 convertase, which initiates the formation of a \\nlaboratories. Flow cytometry for the presence of adhesion \\nmolecules, such as CD18 or CD15, can help diagnose leukocyte \\nadhesion defects. Point mutations that affect the function of \\nthe adhesion molecule but do not alter antibody binding are \\nmissed using flow cytometry. CGD can be diagnosed by the \\nflow cytometry-based test using dihydrorhodamine 123 or the \\nnitroblue tetrazolium test (see Chapter 72). Light microscopy of \\nneutrophils for the presence of giant granules can help diagnose \\nChédiak-Higashi syndrome.\\nTREATMENT\\nTherapy for neutropenia depends on the underlying cause. \\nPatients with severe bacterial infections require broad-spectrum \\nantibiotics; the resolution of neutropenia is the most important \\nprognostic factor. Most patients with severe congenital neu-\\ntropenia or autoimmune neutropenia respond to therapy with \\nG-CSF . Granulocyte transfusion should be reserved for life-\\nthreatening infection. Chronic mild neutropenia not associated \\nwith immunosuppression can be managed expectantly with \\nprompt antimicrobial treatment of soft tissue infections, which \\nusually are caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus.\\nFrequent courses of antibiotics, including trimethoprim-\\nsulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, and surgical débridement of \\ninfections are required in CGD. Because A. fumigatus can \\ncause serious infection in patients with CGD, moldy hay, \\ndecomposing compost, and other nests of fungi must be avoided, \\nand prophylactic antifungals can be helpful. The frequency of \\ninfection in CGD is lessened by treatment with recombinant \\ninterferon-γ administered subcutaneously three times a week. \\nStem cell transplantation (see Chapter 76) may be lifesaving in \\nCGD, LAD-1, and Chédiak-Higashi syndrome.\\nPROGNOSIS AND PREVENTION\\nThe prognosis depends on the particular defect. Milder and \\ntransient defects in neutrophil numbers have a better prognosis. \\nProlonged absence of neutrophils or their function has a poor \\nprognosis, especially with the risk of bacterial and fungal sepsis. \\nTreatment with prophylactic antibiotics and interferon-γ has \\nimproved the prognosis of patients with CGD. Stem cell \\ntransplantation is the only currently available mode of therapy \\nthat can reverse the poor prognosis of severe neutrophil defects. \\nAs in other genetic defects, prenatal diagnosis and genetic \\ncounseling are possible for all known gene mutations.\\nCHAPTER 75 \\nComplement System\\nThe complement system consists of plasma and membrane \\nproteins that function in the innate immune response as well \\nas facilitate adaptive immunity. Complement proteins can kill \\npathogens with or without antibodies, opsonize pathogens to \\nfacilitate their uptake by phagocytes, or mediate inflammation. \\nThe complement system can be activated through three \\npathways—classic, alternative, or lectin—that involve a cascade-\\nlike, sequential activation of complement factors resulting in \\nan amplified response (Fig. 75.1).

Factor I destabilizes C3 convertase \\ncomplexes and degrades the active fragments. Other inhibitors \\ninclude membrane proteins, such as decay accelerating factor, \\nCR1, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and plasma proteins \\nsuch as C4b-binding protein and factor H.

Deficiency of any of these regulatory \\nproteins can result in an inflammatory response, tissue damage, \\nor excessive complement consumption.\\nDisorders of complement proteins can result from inherited \\ndeficiency or can be secondary to increased consumption. The \\nconsequences of decreased complement depend on the affected \\nfactor (see Table 75.1).

C3a and C5a, \\nproduced by cleavage of C3 and C5, respectively, can release \\nhistamine from mast cells and basophils, leading to increased \\nvascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. In \\naddition, C5a has chemotactic activity, attracting phagocytes \\nto the site of complement activation, and it can cause degranula-\\ntion of phagocytic cells. C3b acts as an opsonin when attached \\nto the surface of a pathogen by binding to phagocytes via \\ncomplement receptor 1 (CR1). Its degradation product, iC3b, \\ncan bind to CR3 on the surface of phagocytes leading to the \\ningestion of the C3b-coated or iC3b-coated pathogen. iC3b \\nand its breakdown product C3dg can bind complement receptor \\n2 (CR2) on B cells leading to activation and differentiation.\\nThe complement system is under tight regulation because \\nit has potent inflammatory activity and the potential to cause \\nsignificant damage to host cells.

Immunization of patients and \\nclose contacts with pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines \\nmay be useful, but infections may still occur in immunized \\ncomplement-deficient patients.

Adverse effects, including mas-\\nculinization in females, growth arrest, and hepatitis, limit their \\nuse. Prophylactic administration of fresh frozen plasma before \\nsurgery can prevent angioedema, but administration during \\nan acute episode may exacerbate the episode. Angioedema \\nof the airway can present as an acute emergency, necessitat-\\ning a tracheostomy because administration of epinephrine, \\nantihistamines, or corticosteroids is ineffective in reversing \\nthis type of angioedema. Purified C1-inhibitor is available \\nand can be used prophylactically (before surgery) and during \\nacute episodes of angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme \\ninhibitors, such as captopril, should be avoided in patients with \\nC1-inhibitor deficiency because these drugs can precipitate \\nepisodes of angioedema by inhibiting degradation of kinins that \\nmediate edema formation. Novel therapeutic agents, including \\na kallikrein inhibitor and a bradykinin receptor 2 antagonist, \\nare being investigated as potential therapy for hereditary  \\nangioedema.\\nCHAPTER 76 \\nHematopoietic Stem Cell \\nTransplantation\\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure some \\npatients with primary immunodeficiency disease (Table 76.1). \\nUse of HSCT is limited to immunodeficiency diseases, some \\nmetabolic storage diseases (see Chapters 55 and 56), malignan-\\ncies (see Chapter 154), aplastic anemia (see Chapter 150), \\nhemoglobinopathies (see Chapter 150), and a few other \\ndisorders.\\nThe principle of HSCT is to replace a patient’s defective \\nbone marrow stem cells with normal stem cells. Hematopoietic \\nstem cells reside in the bone marrow but can also be obtained \\nfrom peripheral blood or cord blood. Peripheral blood does \\nnot contain a significant proportion of stem cells unless the \\ndonor’s bone marrow is actively stimulated to generate stem \\ncells. Cord blood is a good source of stem cells and is used for \\nsibling and unrelated HSCT.\\nC2, or C4 deficiency are susceptible to autoimmune diseases, \\nespecially systemic lupus erythematosus. The exact mechanism of \\nthis susceptibility is not known but is thought to arise from the \\nrole of these early components in clearing immune complexes.\\nDeficiency of properdin, C3, or the terminal components \\npredisposes patients to severe recurrent infections. Deficiency \\nof C3, the major opsonin, due to a genetic defect or secondary \\nto excessive consumption, predisposes patients to infections, \\nespecially with encapsulated organisms. Deficiency of one of \\nthe terminal components that compose the MAC predisposes \\npatients to infection with Neisseria meningitidis. Complement \\ndeficiency may be found in 40% of patients presenting with \\nrecurrent neisserial infections. Deficiency of mannose-binding \\nlectin also is associated with an increased frequency of bacterial \\ninfections, including sepsis.\\nCongenital deficiency of C1-inhibitor results in hereditary \\nangioedema, characterized by recurrent episodes of nonpruritic \\nangioedema lasting 48-72 hours that occur spontaneously or \\nafter minor trauma, stress, or anxiety. Abdominal edema can \\ncause acute abdominal pain; edema of the upper airway can be \\nlife threatening and may necessitate emergency tracheostomy. \\nThe disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease \\nand results from a heterozygous deficiency of C1-inhibitor \\nleading to serum levels less than 30% of normal values. Some \\nmutations (type II hereditary angioedema) result in normal \\nlevels of C1-inhibitor with defective function. An acquired form \\nof angioedema results from autoantibodies to C1-inhibitor in \\nlymphoid malignancies or autoimmune disorders but is uncom-\\nmon in childhood. C1-inhibitor is a regulator of Hageman factor \\n(clotting factor XIIa), clotting factor XIa, plasma kallikrein, \\nand plasmin in addition to C1r and C1s. Lack of inhibition \\nof the contact system, Hageman factor and plasma kallikrein, \\nis responsible for the development of angioedema. Deficien-\\ncies in the complement regulatory proteins factor H, factor \\nI, and MCP result in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, \\nmembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, and have \\nbeen linked to age-related macular degeneration.\\nLABORATORY STUDIES\\nThe CH50 test is a widely available test of classic complement \\npathway function, based on an antibody-dependent hemolytic \\nassay, which measures the serum dilution that results in lysis \\nof 50% of sheep red blood cells. The CH50 test depends on the \\nfunction of all nine complement proteins, C1 through C9. The \\nAH50 test, which measures complement activation using red \\nblood cells from different species (e.g., rabbit) that can activate \\nthe alternative pathway without antibody, is less widely available \\nthan the CH50 test and requires the alternative pathway com-\\nponents and C5 to C9. Abnormal results of both tests indicate \\na deficiency in a terminal component common to both pathways, \\nwhereas an abnormal result of one or the other test indicates \\na deficiency of an early component of the respective pathway. \\nIf the CH50 or AH50 levels are abnormal, individual components \\ncan be analyzed in specialized laboratories.\\nDetermination of C1-inhibitor levels and function is needed \\nto diagnose hereditary angioedema. Some functional tests miss \\nrare mutations that allow C1-inhibitor to bind C1s, but not \\none or more of the other enzymes with which it interacts. Low \\nC1-inhibitor levels or function results in chronically decreased \\nC4 levels and decreased C2 levels during acute attacks. Low \\nC1q levels are found in acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Searching and \\nidentifying a donor can be a lengthy process, especially for some \\nunderrepresented ethnic backgrounds. Finding a suitable cord \\nblood donor is faster because the cord blood already has been \\nobtained and stored, whereas bone marrow donors have to be \\nidentified, located, and tested. A matched sibling, if available, \\nis the preferred source of hematopoietic stem cells.\\nPatients with SCID are ideal candidates for HSCT, which \\nis the main option for treatment of SCID, although research \\nis ongoing with gene therapy. Patients are unlikely to survive \\nbeyond 1-2 years of age without transplantation, and they have \\nno T-cell function to reject donor cells. Thus they may not \\nneed to undergo conditioning with chemotherapy or irradiation \\nbefore transplantation. The development of transplantation using \\nT-cell–depleted, haploidentical bone marrow from a parent for \\nSCID has provided almost every patient with SCID a potential \\ndonor. The mother is the preferred source for haploidentical \\nbone marrow, if she is able to donate, because some transfer \\nof maternal T cells can occur during pregnancy, and these \\nmaternal T cells can reject cells obtained from the father. The \\nsurvival rate after HSCT for SCID is approximately 90% with \\nMHC-identical and 60% with haploidentical bone marrow \\ntransplantation. Early transplant before the acquisition of \\ninfection improves outcomes. Because newborn screening for \\nSCID is now possible, stem cell transplantation can occur as \\nearly as possible when the infants are healthy, providing the \\nbest opportunity for a cure.\\nThe decision to treat other primary immunodeficiency \\ndiseases with HSCT is more difficult because it is difficult to \\npredict the prognosis of a particular patient because of the \\nvariability in clinical course of most primary immunodeficiency \\ndiseases. This must be weighed with the risks of transplantation. \\nIn addition, HSCT for other primary immunodeficiencies is less \\nsuccessful than for SCID because patients typically have some \\nT-cell function and require conditioning with the risks that it \\nentails. The availability of a matched related sibling favors the \\ndecision to perform HSCT. Disorders of B cells have not been \\ntreated with HSCT because, in many cases, donor B cells do not \\nengraft, and patients usually do well with intravenous immuno-\\nglobulin. Regardless, a variety of primary immunodeficiencies \\nhave been treated with HSCT (see Table 76.1).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nRejection of the grafted cells is the first potential complication \\nof HSCT and depends on the immunocompetence of the patient, \\nthe degree of MHC incompatibility, and the number of cells \\nadministered. Preconditioning with myeloablative drugs, such \\nas busulfan and cyclophosphamide, can prevent graft rejection \\nbut may be complicated by pulmonary toxicity and by venooc-\\nclusive disease of the liver, which results from damage to the \\nhepatic vascular endothelium and can be fatal. Myeloablation \\nresults in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, making \\npatients susceptible to infection and bleeding disorders. Neu-\\ntropenic precautions should be maintained and patients sup -\\nported with red blood cell and platelet transfusions until the \\nred blood cell, platelet, and neutrophil lineages engraft. Reduced \\nintensity preconditioning has been used recently to prevent \\ngraft rejection and decrease the adverse effects of myeloablation. \\nB-cell lymphoproliferative disorder can develop after T-cell \\ndepleted bone marrow transplantation. GVHD can arise from \\nan MHC-mismatched transplantation or from mismatch in \\nMajor histocompatibility complex (MHC) compatibility \\nis crucial in the choice of a stem cell donor to avoid rejection \\nof the donor cells by the host immune system and to prevent \\ngraft versus host disease (GVHD) caused by contaminating \\nmature T cells. The donor stem cells give rise to T cells that \\ndevelop in the host thymus and need to interact with donor and \\nhost antigen-presenting cells. In cases with MHC mismatched \\ndonors, mature T cells need to be removed from the donor \\nto reduce the risk of GVHD; this complication outweighs \\nthe disadvantage of a prolonged time of 90-120 days before \\nT-cell development. Patients are at risk for developing B-cell \\nlymphoproliferative disease, usually associated with Epstein-\\nBarr virus, when T-cell–depletion techniques are used, likely \\ndue to the delay in T-cell engraftment.\\nThe most important factor affecting outcomes in HSCT \\nis the similarity of the donor MHC. The best outcomes are \\nobtained using MHC-identical siblings (25% chance of a matched \\nsibling) as donors, followed by matched unrelated donors. Unlike \\ntransplantation for other disorders, MHC haploidentical bone \\nmarrow from a parent (preferred) or a sibling can be used to \\ntreat severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), likely the \\nresult of these patients lacking functioning T cells. Stem cells \\nfrom a partially mismatched donor, such as a parent, can give \\nrise to a functioning immune system because the patient shares \\nat least half of the MHC molecules with the donor stem cells.\\nMHC molecules are highly polymorphic, and typing is cur-\\nrently performed on DNA rather than by serology.

Volkman |  A sriani M. Chiu\\nCHAPTER 77 \\nAllergy Assessment\\nAtopy is a result of a complex interaction between multiple \\ngenes and environmental factors. It implies specific immuno-\\nglobulin (Ig)E-mediated diseases, including allergic rhinitis, \\nasthma, and food allergy. An allergen is an antigen that triggers \\nan IgE response in genetically predisposed individuals.\\nHypersensitivity disorders of the immune system are \\nclassified into four groups, based on the mechanism of tissue \\ninflammation (Table 77.1). Type I reactions result from the \\nbinding of antigen to cell surface-bound IgE on high-affinity \\nIgE receptors on tissue mast cells, circulating basophils, or both, \\ncausing the release of preformed chemical mediators, such as \\nhistamine and tryptase, and newly generated mediators, such as \\nleukotrienes, prostaglandins, and platelet-activating factor. These \\nmediators contribute to the development of allergic symptoms, \\nwith anaphylaxis as the most profound syndrome. Several hours \\nafter the initial response, a late-phase reaction may develop \\nwith an influx of other inflammatory cells such as basophils, \\neosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, and their \\ninflammatory mediators. Recruitment of these cells leads to \\nmore persistent and chronic symptoms.\\nType II (cytotoxic antibody) reactions involve IgM, IgG, or \\nIgA antibodies binding to cell surface antigens and activating the \\nentire complement pathway resulting in lysis of the cell or release \\nof anaphylatoxins, such as C3a, C4a, and C5a (see Chapter 75). \\nThese anaphylatoxins trigger mast cell degranulation, resulting \\nin inflammatory mediator release. The target can be cell surface \\nmembrane antigens, such as red blood cells causing hemolytic \\nanemia, platelet cell surface molecules, glomerular basement \\nmembrane molecules, acetylcholine receptor α chain at the \\nneuromuscular junction, and thyroid-stimulating hormone \\nreceptor on thyroid cells causing Graves disease.\\nType III (immune complex) reactions involve the formation \\nof antigen-antibody or immune complexes that enter into the \\ncirculation and are deposited in tissues such as blood vessels and \\nfiltering organs (i.e., liver, spleen, and kidney). These complexes \\ninitiate tissue injury by activating the complement cascade and \\nrecruiting neutrophils that release their toxic mediators. Local \\nreactions caused by the injection of antigen into tissue are \\ncalled Arthus reactions. The administration of large amounts of \\nantigen leads to serum sickness. Other type III reactions include \\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis and some vasculitic syndromes.\\nType IV (cellular immune–mediated or delayed-hyper -\\nsensitivity) reactions involve recognition of antigen by sensitized \\nT cells. Antigen-presenting cells present peptides on the cell \\nsurface in association with major histocompatibility complex \\nclass II (MHC-II) molecules. Memory T cells recognize the \\npeptide/MHC-II complex resulting in cytokine release (e.g., \\ninterferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-\\nmacrophage colony-stimulating factor), which activates and \\nTABLE 77.1 Gell and Coombs Classification of Hypersensitivity Disorders\\nTYPE\\nINTERVAL BETWEEN \\nEXPOSURE AND REACTION\\nEFFECTOR \\nMOLECULE\\nTARGET OR \\nANTIGEN\\nEXAMPLES OF \\nMEDIATORSEXAMPLES\\nI Immediate\\nLate phase\\n<30 min\\n2-12 hr\\nIgE Pollens, food, \\nvenom, drugs\\nHistamine, tryptase, \\nleukotrienes, \\nprostaglandins, platelet-\\nactivating factor\\nAnaphylaxis, urticaria, \\nallergic rhinitis, allergic \\nasthma\\nII Cytotoxic \\nantibody\\nVariable (minutes to hours) IgM, IgG, IgA Red blood cells, \\nplatelets\\nComplement Hemolytic anemia, \\nthrombocytopenia, \\nGoodpasture syndrome\\nIII Immune \\ncomplex\\n1-3 wk after drug exposure Antigen-\\nantibody \\ncomplexes\\nBlood vessels, \\nliver, spleen, \\nkidney, lung\\nComplement, \\nanaphylatoxin\\nSerum sickness, \\nhypersensitivity \\npneumonitis\\nIV Delayed \\ntype\\n2-7 days after drug exposure Lymphocytes Mycobacterium \\ntuberculosis, \\nchemicals\\nCytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, \\nGM-CSF)\\nTB skin test reactions, \\ncontact dermatitis, \\ngraft-versus-host disease\\nCSF, Cerebrospinal fluid; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TB, tuberculosis; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Chronic inflammation can lead to airway remodel-\\ning, which results from a proliferation of extracellular matrix \\nproteins and vascular hyperplasia and may lead to irreversible \\nstructural changes and progressive loss of pulmonary \\nfunction.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAsthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in \\nindustrialized countries, affecting nearly 7 million children \\nyounger than 18 years of age in the United States. From 2001 \\nto 2010, individuals with asthma increased by 2.9% per year. \\nIn adults, females are more likely than males to have asthma, \\nbut in children the reverse is true. Among children less than \\n18 years of age, asthma prevalence increased by 1.4% per year. \\nIn 2010, pediatric hospitalizations for asthma numbered close \\nto 140,000. Mortality from asthma occurs; in 2014, 187 deaths \\nwere attributed to asthma. For children, the death rate is 2.5 \\nper million.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nProperly performed skin tests are the most sensitive method \\nfor detecting the presence of allergen-specific IgE.\\nIn vitro serum testing , such as immunoassays like the \\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), measures levels \\nof antigen-specific IgE. Many allergists and laboratories regard \\nthe ImmunoCAP System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, \\nMassachusetts) as the method of choice. This method uses a solid \\nphase and shows higher sensitivity, specificity, and reproduc-\\nibility. The assay uses a quantitative fluorescent immunoassay \\n(FEIA) that is more sensitive than other methods. Serum-based \\ntests are indicated for patients who have dermatographism or \\nextensive dermatitis; who cannot discontinue medications, such \\nas antihistamines that interfere with skin test results; or who \\nare noncompliant for skin testing. The presence of specific IgE \\nantibodies suggests sensitization but is not sufficient for the \\ndiagnosis of allergic disease. Diagnosis must be based on the \\nphysician’s assessment of the entire clinical picture, including  \\nthe history and physical examination, the presence of specific \\nIgE antibodies, and the correlation with IgE-mediated symptoms.\\nDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING\\nDiagnostic imaging has a limited role in the evaluation of allergic \\ndisease. Chest radiography is helpful with the differential \\ndiagnosis of asthma. Sinus radiography and computed tomog-\\nraphy may be useful, but when these images are abnormal, \\nthey do not distinguish allergic disease from nonallergic disease.\\nCHAPTER 78 \\nAsthma\\nETIOLOGY\\nInflammatory cells (mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, \\nneutrophils), chemical mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, \\nplatelet-activating factor, bradykinin), and chemotactic factors \\n(cytokines, eotaxin) mediate the underlying inflammation found \\nin asthmatic airways. Inflammation contributes to airway \\nhyperresponsiveness (airways constricting in response to \\nallergens, irritants, viral infections, and exercise). It also results \\nin edema, increased mucus production in the lungs, influx of \\ninflammatory cells into the airway tissue, and epithelial cell \\nTABLE 77.4 Comparison of In Vivo Skin Tests and In Vitro \\nSerum IgE Antibody Immunoassay in Allergic \\nDiagnosis\\nIN VIVO SKIN TEST\\nIN VITRO SERUM \\nIMMUNOASSAY\\nLess expensive Patient/physician convenience\\nGreater sensitivity Not suppressed by antihistamines\\nWide allergen selection Preferable to skin testing for \\ndermatographism, widespread \\ndermatitis, or uncooperative \\nchildren\\nResults available immediately\\nFrom Skoner DP.

Common \\nexacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to \\nallergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, air pollution, strong odors, \\nfumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. \\nNocturnal symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesopha-\\ngeal reflux, and aspirin can aggravate asthma. Treatment of \\nthese conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of \\nasthma.\\nDuring acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheez-\\ning, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical \\nfindings may be subtle. Wheezing may not be prominent if \\nthere is poor aeration from airway obstruction. As the attack \\nprogresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, \\nagitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, \\nand pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm \\nHg with inspiration) may be observed.

It \\noccurs primarily in patients with steroid-dependent asthma \\nand in patients with cystic fibrosis.\\nTREATMENT\\nOptimal medical treatment of asthma includes several key \\ncomponents: environmental control, pharmacologic therapy, \\nand patient education, including attainment of self-management \\nskills. Because many children with asthma have coexisting \\nallergies, steps to minimize allergen exposure should be taken \\n(Table 78.3). For all children with asthma, exposures to tobacco \\nand wood smoke and to persons with viral infections should \\nbe minimized. Influenza immunization is indicated. Asthma \\nmedications can be divided into long-term control medications \\nand quick-relief medications.\\nLong-Term Control Medications\\nInhaled Corticosteroids\\nInhaled corticosteroids are the most effective antiinflammatory \\nmedications for the treatment of chronic, persistent asthma \\nand are the preferred therapy when initiating long-term control \\ntherapy. Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids reduces \\nmorbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. \\nRegular use reduces airway hyperreactivity, the need for rescue \\nbronchodilator therapy, risk of hospitalization, and risk of death \\nfrom asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are available as inhalation \\naerosols, dry powder inhalers, and a nebulizer solution.\\nThe potential risks of inhaled corticosteroids are favorably \\nbalanced with their benefits. A reduction in growth velocity may \\noccur with poorly controlled asthma or inhaled corticosteroid \\nuse. Low-to-medium dose inhaled corticosteroids may decrease \\ngrowth velocity, although these effects are small (approximately \\n1 cm in t he first year of treatment), generally not progressive, \\nand may be reversible. Height measurements should be moni-\\ntored. Inhaled corticosteroids do not have clinically significant \\nadverse effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, \\nglucose metabolism, subcapsular cataracts, or glaucoma when \\nused at low-to-medium doses in children. Rinsing the mouth \\nafter inhalation and using large volume spacers help lessen the \\nlocal adverse effects of dysphonia and candidiasis and decrease \\nsystemic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Inhaled \\ncorticosteroids should be titrated to the lowest dose needed to \\nthe severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 \\nyears of age can usually perform spirometry maneuvers. Vari-\\nability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry \\npreferred over peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. \\nFor younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers \\nor peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications aids \\nin the diagnosis of asthma.\\nAllergy skin testing should be included in the evaluation \\nof all children with persistent asthma but not during an exac-\\nerbation of symptoms. Positive skin test results, identifying \\nsensitization to aeroallergens (e.g., pollens, mold, dust mite, \\npet dander), correlate strongly with bronchial allergen provoca-\\ntive challenges. In vitro serum tests, such as enzyme-linked \\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), are generally less sensitive in \\ndefining clinically pertinent allergens, are more expensive, and \\nrequire several days for results, compared to several minutes \\nfor skin testing (see Table 77.4).\\nAn x-ray should be performed with the first episode of \\nasthma or with recurrent episodes of undiagnosed cough \\nor wheeze to exclude anatomic abnormalities. Repeat chest \\nx-rays are not needed with new episodes unless there is fever \\n(suggesting pneumonia) or localized findings on physical  \\nexamination.\\nTwo novel forms of monitoring asthma and airway inflam-\\nmation directly include exhaled nitric oxide analysis and \\nquantitative analysis of expectorated sputum for eosinophilia.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMany childhood conditions can cause wheezing and coughing \\nlike asthma (Table 78.1), but not all cough and wheeze is asthma. \\nTABLE 78.1 Differential Diagnosis of Cough and Wheeze in Infants and Children\\nUPPER AIRWAY \\nDISEASES\\nOBSTRUCTION INVOLVING \\nLARGE AIRWAYS\\nOBSTRUCTION INVOLVING \\nSMALL AIRWAYSOTHER\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nSinusitis\\nTracheal or bronchial foreign body\\nParadoxical vocal fold motion\\nVascular rings or laryngeal webs\\nEnlarged lymph nodes or tumor\\nViral bronchiolitis or obliterative \\nbronchiolitis\\nCystic fibrosis\\nBronchopulmonary dysplasia \\n(chronic lung disease of \\nprematurity)\\nRecurrent cough not caused by asthma \\n(infection, habit cough, postnasal drip)\\nAspiration from swallowing mechanism \\ndysfunction or gastroesophageal reflux \\ndisease\\nFrom Guilbert TW, Lemanske RF, Jackson DJ.

Two classes of leukotriene modifiers include cysteinyl \\nleukotriene receptor antagonists (zafirlukast and montelukast) \\nand leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (zileuton). The leukotriene \\nreceptor antagonists have much wider appeal than zileuton. \\nZafirlukast is approved for children older than 5 years of age \\nand is given twice daily. Montelukast is dosed once daily at \\nnight as 4-mg granules or chewable tablets (for children 6 \\nmonths to 5 years of age), 5-mg chewable tablets (6-14 years \\nof age), and 10-mg tablets (≥15 years of age). Pediatric studies \\nshow the usefulness of leukotriene modifiers in mild asthma \\nand the attenuation of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. \\nThese agents may be helpful as steroid-sparing agents in patients \\nwith asthma that is more difficult to control.\\nLong-Acting β2-Agonists\\nLong-acting β2-agonists, formoterol and salmeterol, have twice-\\ndaily dosing and relax airway smooth muscle for 12 hours but \\ndo not have any significant antiinflammatory effects. Adding \\na long-acting bronchodilator to inhaled corticosteroid therapy \\nis more beneficial than doubling the dose of inhaled corticoster-\\noids. Multiple formulations are available. Formoterol is approved \\nfor use in children older than 5 years of age for maintenance \\nasthma therapy and for prevention of exercise-induced asthma. \\nIt has a rapid onset of action similar to albuterol (15 minutes). \\nSalmeterol is approved for children 4 years of age or older and \\nhas an onset of 30 minutes. Because combination inhalers \\nadminister two medications simultaneously, compliance is \\ngenerally improved.\\nTheophylline\\nTheophylline was more widely used previously, but because \\ncurrent management is aimed at inflammatory control, its \\npopularity has declined. It is mildly to moderately effective as \\na bronchodilator and is considered an alternative, add-on \\ntreatment to low- and medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. \\nHowever, its therapeutic window is narrow necessitating \\nmonitoring of blood levels.\\nBiologics\\nOmalizumab is a humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody \\nthat prevents binding of free IgE to high-affinity receptors on \\nbasophils and mast cells. It is approved for moderate to severe \\nallergic asthma in children 6 years of age and older. Omalizumab \\nis delivered by subcutaneous injection every 2-4 weeks, depend-\\ning on body weight and pretreatment serum IgE level.\\nMepolizumab is an add-on maintenance therapy for severe \\nasthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in patients aged 12 \\nyears and older. It is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody \\ninjected subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Mepolizumab decreases \\nthe production and survival of eosinophils, a major inflammatory \\ncell involved in asthma pathogenesis.\\nQuick-Relief Medications\\nShort-Acting β2-Agonists\\nShort-acting β2-agonists such as albuterol and levalbuterol are \\neffective bronchodilators that exert their effect by relaxing \\nbronchial smooth muscle within 5-10 minutes of administration. \\nThese effects last 4-6 hours. Generally, a short-acting β2-agonist \\nis prescribed for acute symptoms and as prophylaxis before \\nmaintain control of a child’s asthma. For children with severe \\nasthma, high dose inhaled corticosteroids may be needed to \\nminimize oral corticosteroid use, but other “add-on” therapy \\nshould be considered (see the following sections).\\nLeukotriene Modifiers\\nLeukotrienes, synthesized via the arachidonic acid metabolism \\ncascade, are potent mediators of inflammation and smooth \\nmuscle bronchoconstriction. Leukotriene modifiers are oral, \\nTABLE 78.3 Controlling Factors Contributing to Asthma \\nSeverity\\nMAJOR INDOOR \\nTRIGGERS FOR \\nASTHMA\\nSUGGESTIONS FOR REDUCING \\nEXPOSURE\\nViral upper \\nrespiratory tract \\n(RSV, influenza virus)\\nLimit exposure to viral infections (day care \\nwith fewer children)\\nAnnual influenza immunization for children \\nwith persistent asthma\\nTobacco smoke, \\nwood smoke\\nNo smoking around the child or in child’s \\nhome\\nHelp parents and caregivers quit smoking\\nEliminate use of wood stoves and fireplaces\\nDust mites ESSENTIAL ACTIONS\\nEncase pillow, mattress, and box spring in \\nallergen-impermeable encasements\\nWash bedding in hot water weekly\\nDESIRABLE ACTIONS\\nAvoid sleeping or lying on upholstered \\nfurniture\\nMinimize number of stuffed toys in child’s \\nbedroom\\nReduce indoor humidity to <50%\\nIf possible, remove carpets from bedroom \\nand play areas; if not possible, vacuum \\nweekly\\nAnimal dander Remove the pet from the home or keep \\noutdoors (if removal is not acceptable)\\nKeep pet out of bedroom/no sleeping with \\npet\\nUse a filter on air ducts in child’s room\\nWash pet weekly (the evidence to support \\nthis has not been firmly established)\\nCockroach allergens Do not leave food or garbage exposed\\nPesticides\\nSealing cracks and holes\\nIndoor mold Avoid vaporizers\\nReduce indoor humidity to <50%\\nUse of mold inhibiting cleaner\\nUse of dehumidifier\\nFix leaky faucets, pipes\\nRSV, Respiratory syncytial virus.\\nFrom American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology.

Daily long-\\nterm control therapy is recommended for infants and young \\nchildren 0-4 years of age who had four or more episodes of \\nwheezing in the previous year that lasted more than 1 day, \\naffected sleep, and who have a positive asthma predictive index. \\nFor children over 5 years of age with moderate persistent asthma, \\ncombining long-acting bronchodilators with low-to-medium \\ndoses of inhaled corticosteroids improves lung function and \\nreduces rescue medication use. For children with severe per-\\nsistent asthma, a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid combined \\nwith a long-acting bronchodilator is the preferred therapy. \\nThe guidelines also recommend that treatment be reevaluated \\nwithin 4-6 weeks of initiating therapy. Once asthma is under \\ncontrol, control should be assessed on an ongoing basis every \\n1-6 months. The asthma should be well controlled for at least \\n3 months before stepping down therapy.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nMost asthma exacerbations can be successfully managed at \\nhome. Status asthmaticus is an acute exacerbation of asthma \\nthat does not respond adequately to therapeutic measures and \\nmay require hospitalization. Exacerbations may progress over \\nseveral days or occur suddenly and can range in severity from \\nmild to life threatening. Significant respiratory distress, dyspnea, \\nwheezing, cough, and a decrease in spirometry or peak expira-\\ntory flow rate (PEFR)  characterize deterioration in asthma \\ncontrol. During a severe episode, pulse oximetry is helpful in \\nmonitoring oxygenation. In status asthmaticus, arterial blood \\ngases may be necessary for measurement of ventilation. As \\nairway obstruction worsens and chest compliance decreases, \\ncarbon dioxide retention can occur. In the face of tachypnea, \\na normal PCO2 (35-45 mm Hg) indicates impending respiratory \\narrest.\\nFirst-line management of asthma exacerbations includes \\nsupplemental oxygen if needed and repetitive or continuous \\nadministration of short-acting bronchodilators. Early administra-\\ntion of oral or intravenous corticosteroids (Fig. 78.4) is important \\nin treating the underlying inflammation. Administration of \\nanticholinergic agents (ipratropium) with bronchodilators \\ndecreases rates of hospitalization and duration of time in the \\nemergency department. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is \\nadministered in the emergency department if there is clinical \\ndeterioration despite treatment with β2-agonists, ipratropium, \\nand systemic corticosteroids. The typical dose of magnesium \\nsulfate is 25-75  m g/kg (maximum 2.0  g) in travenously \\nadministered over 20 minutes. Intramuscular epinephrine or \\nsubcutaneous terbutaline are rarely used except when severe \\nasthma is associated with anaphylaxis or unresponsive to \\ncontinuous administration of short-acting bronchodilators.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nFor some children, symptoms of wheezing with respiratory \\ninfections subside in the preschool years, whereas others have \\nmore persistent asthma symptoms. Prognostic indicators \\nfor children younger than 3 years of age who are at risk for \\npersistent asthma are known as the Modified Asthma Predic-\\ntive Index for children (Table 78.4). Atopy is the strongest \\nallergen exposure and exercise. The inhaled route is preferred \\nbecause adverse effects—tremor, prolonged tachycardia, and \\nirritability—are less. Overuse of β2-agonists implies inadequate \\ncontrol, and a change in medications may be warranted. The \\ndefinition of bronchodilator overuse depends on the severity \\nof the child’s asthma; use of more than one metered dose inhaler \\ncanister per month or daily use suggests poor control.\\nAnticholinergic Agents\\nIpratropium bromide is a short-acting anticholinergic bron-\\nchodilator that relieves bronchoconstriction, decreases mucus \\nhypersecretion, and counteracts cough-receptor irritability by \\nbinding acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors found in \\nbronchial smooth muscle. It seems to have an additive effect \\nwith β2-agonists when used for acute asthma exacerbations.\\nA long-acting anticholinergic agent (tiotropium) is approved \\nfor use in moderate to severe persistent asthma in children 12 \\nyears or older. It inhibits muscarinic receptors on bronchial \\nsmooth muscle to induce bronchodilation.\\nOral Corticosteroids\\nShort bursts of oral corticosteroids (3-10 days) are adminis-\\ntered to children with acute exacerbations. The usual dose is \\n1-2 m g/kg/day of prednisone for 5 days. Oral corticosteroids \\nare available in liquid or tablet formulations. Prolonged use \\nof oral corticosteroids can result in systemic adverse effects \\nsuch as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression, cushingoid \\nfeatures, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma, \\nimpaired immunity, osteoporosis, and growth suppression. \\nChildren with severe asthma may require oral corticosteroids \\nover extended periods. The dose should be tapered as soon as \\npossible to the minimum effective dose, preferably administered \\non alternate days.\\nAdministration of two doses of dexamethasone for the \\ntreatment of acute asthma exacerbations has been used, usually \\nin an emergency room setting for intermittent, mild persis-\\ntent, or moderate persistent asthma. This oral corticosteroid \\nhas properties that may increase compliance with therapy, \\ndecrease missed school days, and decrease readmission rates. \\nResults are mixed and have not been translated to outpatient  \\nsettings.\\nApproach to Therapy\\nTherapy is based on the concept that chronic airway inflam -\\nmation is a fundamental feature of asthma, which can vary in \\nintensity over time, requiring treatment to be adjusted accord-\\ningly. Classification of asthma severity is emphasized for initia-\\ntion of therapy in patients not currently receiving controller \\nmedications. Assessing control is emphasized for monitoring \\nand adjusting therapy. A stepwise approach is used for manage-\\nment of infants and young children 0-4 years of age, children \\n5-11 years of age (Fig. 78.1), and youths 12 years or older, and \\nadults (Fig. 78.2). Medication type, dose, and dosing intervals \\nare determined by the level of asthma severity or asthma control. \\nTherapy is then increased (stepped up) as necessary and \\ndecreased (stepped down) when possible. A short-acting \\nbronchodilator should be available for all children with asthma. \\nA child with intermittent asthma has asthma symptoms less \\nthan two times per week. To determine whether a child is \\nhaving more persistent asthma, using the Rules of Two is helpful: \\ndaytime symptoms occurring two or more times per week or \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The clinician must monitor the patient’s\\n  response on several clinical parameters and adjust the dose accordingly. Once control of asthma is achieved, the dose should be carefully titrated to the minimum\\n  dose required to maintain control.\\n• Preparations are not interchangeable on a µg or per puff basis. This figure presents estimated comparable daily doses. See EPR–3 Full Report 2007 for full\\n  discussion.\\n• Some doses may be outside package labeling, especially in the high-dose range. Budesonide nebulizer suspension is the only inhaler corticosteroid (ICS) with FDA-\\n  approved labeling for children <4 years of age.\\n• For children <4 years of age: The safety and efficacy of ICSs in children <1 year has not been established. Children <4 years of age generally require delivery of ICS\\n  (budesonide and fluticasone HFA) through a face mask that should fit snugly over nose and mouth and avoid nebulizing in the eyes. Wash face after each treatment\\n  to prevent local corticosteroid side effects. For budesonide, the dose may be administered 1–3 times daily. Budesonide suspension is compatible with Albuterol,\\n  Ipratropium, and Levalbuterol nebulizer solutions in the same nebulizer. Use only jet nebulizers, as ultrasonic nebulizers are ineffective for suspensions. For\\n  Fluticasone HFA, the dose should be divided 2 times daily; the low dose for children <4 years of age is higher than for children 5–11 years of age due to lower dose\\n  delivered with face mask and data on efficacy in young children.\\nPotential Adverse Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids:\\n• Cough, dysphonia, oral thrush (candidiasis).\\n• Spacer or valved holding chamber with non-breath-actuated MDIs and mouthwashing and spitting after inhalation decrease local side effects.\\n• A number of the ICSs, including Fluticasone, Budesonide, and Mometasone, are metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver by CYP 3A4 isoenzymes. Potent\\n  inhibitors of CYP 3A4, such as Ritonavir and Ketoconazole, have the potential for increasing systemic concentrations of these ICSs by increasing oral availability and\\n  decreasing systemic clearance. Some cases of clinically significant Cushing syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency have been reported.\\n• In high doses, systemic effects may occur, although studies are not conclusive, and clinical significance of these effects has not been established (e.g., adrenal\\n  suppression, osteoporosis, skin thinning, and easy bruising).

Successful education involves teaching \\nbasic asthma facts, explaining the role of medications, teaching \\nenvironmental control measures, and improving patient skills \\nin the use of spacer devices for metered dose inhalers and peak \\nflow monitoring. Families should have an asthma management \\nplan (Fig. 78.5) for daily care and for exacerbations.\\nPeak flow monitoring is a self-assessment tool that may \\nbe helpful for children with asthma over 5 years of age who \\nare poor perceivers of airway obstruction, have moderate to \\nsevere asthma, or have a history of severe exacerbations. Peak \\nflow monitoring also can be useful in children who are still \\nlearning to recognize asthma symptoms. It must be emphasized \\nthat peak flow monitoring is not for the diagnosis of asthma \\nbut for monitoring.\\nA child’s personal best peak flow (PEFR) is the highest value \\nachieved over a 2-week period when asthma is controlled. \\nPercentages based on the best PEFR reading may then be \\nincorporated into a written asthma management plan as a \\nmeans of providing an objective indication of airway obstruction \\nin order to guide home-based asthma care. Limitations exist, \\nhowever, to PEFR: they are effort and technique dependent, \\npeak flow meters may lose accuracy with time, and appropriate \\nrange meters (low versus high) must be provided.\\nIn addition, the medical literature has not shown consistently \\nthat monitoring PEFR is valuable for home-based asthma care. \\nLikewise, written asthma management plans have not been \\nshown consistently to be useful in asthma care at home. However, \\nutilizing both of these two tools simultaneously trend toward \\na significant impact on asthma monitoring and management. \\nPerhaps the most significant factor to positively impact asthma \\noutcomes is simply having a plan in place to manage changes \\nin asthma symptomatology.\\nChildren with asthma should be seen not only when they \\nare ill but also when they are healthy. Regular office visits allow \\nthe health care team to review adherence to medication and \\ncontrol measures and to determine whether doses of medications \\nneed adjustment.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Physical findings may be subtle. Classic physical findings \\ninclude pale or bluish, boggy and edematous nasal turbinates \\nwith clear, watery secretions. Frequent nasal itching and rubbing \\nof the nose superiorly with the palm of the hand, the allergic \\nsalute, can lead to a transverse nasal crease found across the \\nnose. Children may produce clucking sounds by rubbing the \\nsoft palate with their tongue. Oropharyngeal examination may \\nreveal lymphoid hyperplasia of the posterior oropharynx or \\nvisible mucus or both. Orthodontic abnormalities may be seen \\nin children with chronic mouth breathing. Allergic shiners, \\ndark, edematous infraorbital areas caused by venous congestion, \\nalong with eyelid edema or conjunctival injection, are often \\npresent in children. Retracted tympanic membranes from \\neustachian tube dysfunction or serous otitis media also may \\nbe present. Evidence of other atopic diseases, such as asthma \\nor eczema, may be present, which helps lead the clinician to \\nthe correct diagnosis.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nAllergy testing can be performed by in vivo skin tests or by in \\nvitro serum tests (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) \\nto pertinent allergens found in the patient’s environment (see \\nTable 77.4). Skin tests (prick/puncture) provide immediate and \\naccurate results. Positive tests correlate strongly with nasal and \\nbronchial allergen provocative challenges. In vitro serum tests \\nare useful for patients with diffuse dermatitis, dermatographism, \\npoor tolerance to skin testing, or for those taking medications \\nthat interfere with skin testing. Disadvantages of serum tests \\ninclude increased cost, inability to obtain immediate results, \\nand reduced sensitivity compared with skin tests. Testing should \\ninclude relevant allergens in the home and regional flora. Broad \\nscreening testing without regard to symptoms is not recom-\\nmended. Measurement of total serum IgE or blood eosinophils \\ngenerally is not helpful. The presence of eosinophils on the \\nnasal smear suggests a diagnosis of allergy, but eosinophils  \\nalso can be found in patients with nonallergic rhinitis with \\neosinophilia. Nasal smear eosinophilia is often predictive of \\na good clinical response to nasal corticosteroid sprays, but is \\nnot commonly performed in clinical practice.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nRhinitis can be divided into allergic and nonallergic rhinitis \\n(Table 79.1). Nonallergic rhinitis describes a group of nasal \\ndiseases in which there is no evidence of allergic etiology. It \\ncan be divided further into nonanatomic and anatomic etiologies. \\nThe most common form of nonallergic rhinitis in children is \\ninfectious rhinitis, which may be acute or chronic. Acute \\ninfectious rhinitis (the common cold) is caused by viruses, \\nincluding rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and typically resolves \\nwithin 7-10 days (see Chapter 102). An average child has three \\nto six common colds per year, with the most affected being \\nyounger children and children attending day care. Infection is \\nsuggested by the presence of sore throat, fever, and poor appetite, \\nespecially with a history of exposure to others with colds. \\nChronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be \\nsuspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with \\nCHAPTER 79 \\nAllergic Rhinitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nRhinitis describes diseases that involve inflammation of the \\nnasal epithelium and is characterized by sneezing, pruritus, \\nrhinorrhea, and congestion. There are many different causes \\nof rhinitis in children, but approximately half of all cases are \\ncaused by allergies.\\nAllergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, is caused \\nby an IgE-mediated allergic response. During the early allergic \\nphase, mast cells degranulate and release preformed chemical \\nmediators, such as histamine and tryptase, and newly generated \\nmediators such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and platelet-\\nactivating factor. After a quiescent phase in which other cells \\nare recruited, a late phase occurs approximately 4-8 hours later. \\nEosinophils, basophils, CD4 T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils \\nrelease their chemical mediators, which leads to the development \\nof chronic nasal inflammation.\\nAllergic rhinitis can be seasonal, perennial, or episodic \\ndepending on the particular causative allergen and exposure. \\nSome children experience perennial symptoms with seasonal \\nexacerbations. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is caused by airborne \\npollens, which have seasonal patterns. Typically trees pollinate \\nin the spring, grasses in late spring to summer, and weeds \\nin the summer and fall. The pollen, microscopic in size, can \\ntravel airborne hundreds of miles and be inhaled easily into \\nthe respiratory tract. Perennial allergic rhinitis is primarily \\ncaused by indoor allergens, such as house dust mites, animal \\ndander, mold, and cockroaches. Episodic rhinitis occurs with \\nintermittent exposure to allergens, such as visiting a friend’s \\nhome where a pet dwells.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nChronic rhinitis is one of the most common disorders encoun-\\ntered in infants and children. Overall allergic rhinitis is observed \\nin 10-25% of the general population, with children and ado-\\nlescents more commonly affected than adults. The prevalence \\nof physician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis has been estimated at \\n40%.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nRhinorrhea\\nRed Eye\\nCough\\nHoarseness\\nThe hallmark symptoms of allergic rhinitis are clear thin rhinor-\\nrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing paroxysms, and pruritus of \\nthe eyes, nose, ears, and palate. Postnasal drip may result in \\nfrequent attempts to clear the throat, nocturnal cough, and \\nhoarseness.

Some newborns show respiratory difficulty \\nwhile feeding only. Nearly half of infants with choanal atresia \\nhave other congenital anomalies as a part of the CHARGE \\nassociation (coloboma, congenital heart disease, choanal atresia, \\nretardation, genitourinary defects, ear anomalies). Unilateral \\nchoanal atresia may go undiagnosed until later in life and \\npresents with symptoms of unilateral nasal obstruction and \\ndischarge.\\nNasal polyps typically appear as bilateral, gray, glistening \\ntissue originating from the sinus ostia and may be associated \\nwith anosmia, nasal obstruction, and clear or purulent nasal \\ndischarge. Nasal polyps are rare in children younger than 10 \\nyears of age but if present, warrant evaluation for an underly-\\ning disease process, such as cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary \\ndyskinesia. Aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease consists \\nof asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and nasal polyps with chronic \\nor recurrent sinusitis.\\nForeign bodies are seen more commonly in young children \\nwho place food, small toys, stones, or other objects in their \\nnose. The index of suspicion should be raised by a history of \\nunilateral, purulent nasal discharge or foul odor. The foreign \\nbody can often be seen on anterior nasal examination.\\nTREATMENT\\nManagement of allergic rhinitis is based on disease severity, \\nimpact of the disease on the patient, and the ability of the \\npatient to comply with recommendations. Treatment modalities \\ninclude allergen avoidance, pharmacologic therapy, and immu-\\nnotherapy. Environmental control and steps to minimize allergen \\nexposure, similar to preventive steps for asthma, should be \\nimplemented whenever possible (see Table 78.3).\\nPharmacotherapy\\nIntranasal corticosteroids are the most effective pharmacologic \\ntherapy for treatment of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. These \\ninclude beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, flunisolide, \\nfluticasone, mometasone, and triamcinolone. These topical \\nagents work to reduce inflammation, edema, and mucus produc-\\ntion. They are effective for symptoms of nasal congestion, \\nrhinorrhea, pruritus, and sneezing but less helpful for ocular \\nsymptoms. Daily administration is necessary for maximum \\nsymptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104). Classic \\nsigns of acute sinusitis in older children include facial tenderness, \\ntooth pain, headache, and fever. Classic signs are usually not \\npresent in young children who may present with postnasal \\ndrainage with cough, throat clearing, halitosis, and rhinorrhea. \\nThe character of the nasal secretions with infectious rhinitis \\nvaries from purulent to minimal or absent. Coexistence of \\nmiddle ear disease, such as otitis media or eustachian tube \\ndysfunction, may be additional clues of infection.\\nNonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis (formerly known as \\nvasomotor rhinitis) can manifest as rhinorrhea and sneezing in \\nchildren with profuse clear nasal discharge. Exposure to irritants, \\nsuch as cigarette smoke and dust, and strong fumes and odors, \\nsuch as perfumes and chlorine in swimming pools, can trigger \\nthese nasal symptoms. Nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia \\nsyndrome is associated with clear nasal discharge and eosinophils \\non nasal smear and is seen infrequently in children. Cold air \\n(skier’s nose), hot/spicy food ingestion (gustatory rhinitis), \\nand exposure to bright light (reflex rhinitis) are examples of \\nnonallergic, noninfectious rhinitis. Treatment with topical \\nipratropium before exposure may be helpful.\\nRhinitis medicamentosa is due primarily to overuse of \\ntopical nasal decongestants, such as oxymetazoline, or phen-\\nylephrine, resulting in rebound nasal congestion. This condition \\nis not common in younger children. Adolescents or young adults \\nmay become dependent on these over-the-counter medications. \\nTreatment requires discontinuation of the offending decongestant \\nspray, topical corticosteroids, and frequently, a short course of \\noral corticosteroids.\\nThe most common anatomic problem seen in young children \\nis obstruction secondary to adenoidal hypertrophy, which can \\nbe suspected from symptoms such as mouth breathing, snoring, \\nhyponasal speech, sleep disordered breathing, and persistent \\nrhinitis with or without chronic otitis media. Infection of the \\nnasopharynx may be secondary to infected hypertrophied \\nadenoid tissue.\\nChoanal atresia is the most common congenital anomaly \\nof the nose and consists of either bony or membranous septum \\nbetween the nose and pharynx, either unilateral or bilateral. \\nBilateral choanal atresia classically presents in neonates as cyclic \\ncyanosis because neonates are obligate nose breathers. Airway \\nobstruction and cyanosis are relieved when the mouth is opened \\nto cry and recurs when the calm infant reattempts to breathe \\nTABLE 79.1 Classification of the Etiology of Rhinitis in Children\\nALLERGIC\\nNONALLERGIC\\nNonanatomic Anatomic\\nSeasonal\\nPerennial\\nEpisodic\\nNonallergic, noninfectious (vasomotor) rhinitis\\nInfectious rhinosinusitis\\nNonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia\\nRhinitis medicamentosa\\nAdenoidal hypertrophy\\nCSF rhinorrhea\\nChoanal atresia\\nCongenital anomalies\\nForeign body\\nNasal polyps\\nSeptal deviation\\nTumors\\nTurbinate hypertrophy\\nCSF, Cerebrospinal fluid.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Children with allergic rhinitis \\nmay experience sleep disturbances, limitations of activity, \\nirritability, and mood and cognitive disorders that adversely \\naffect their performance at school and their sense of \\nwell-being.\\nPROGNOSIS AND PREVENTION\\nSeasonal allergic rhinitis is a common and prominent condition \\nthat may not improve as children grow older. Patients become \\nmore adept at self-management. Perennial allergic rhinitis \\nimproves with allergen control of indoor allergens.\\nRemoval or avoidance of the offending allergen is advised. \\nThe only effective measure for minimizing pet allergen exposure \\nis removal of the pet from the home. Avoidance of pollen and \\noutdoor molds can be accomplished by staying indoors in a \\ncontrolled environment. Air conditioning and keeping windows \\nand doors closed lower exposure to pollen. High-efficiency \\nparticle air filters reduce exposure to allergens (e.g., pet dander). \\nSealing the mattress and pillow in allergen-proof encasings is \\nthe most effective strategy for reduction of dust mite allergen. \\nBedding should be washed in hot water (>130°F) every week.\\nCHAPTER 80 \\nAtopic Dermatitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, relapsing inflammatory \\nskin condition. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves \\na complex interplay of genetics, immunologic abnormalities, \\nimpaired skin barrier function, environmental interactions, \\nand infectious triggers. A diverse set of genes encoding epidermal \\nstructural proteins (filaggrin) and elements of the immune \\nsystem play a major role in atopic dermatitis.\\nSeveral immunoregulatory abnormalities have been described \\nin patients with atopic dermatitis. There is an exaggerated \\ncutaneous inflammatory response to environmental triggers, \\nincluding irritants and allergens. Activated Langerhans cells in \\nthe dermis expressing surface-bound immunoglobulin (Ig)E \\nstimulate T cells. In acute lesions, activated Th2 lymphocytes \\ninfiltrate the dermis. They initiate and maintain local tissue \\ninflammation primarily through interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13, and \\nIL-5, promoting IgE production and eosinophil differentiation, \\nrespectively. As the disease progresses from an acute to chronic \\nphase, the Th2 response switches to Th1/Th0 response. Chronic \\nlesions are characterized by increased IL-12 and IL-18.\\nPatients with atopic dermatitis have hyperirritable skin, \\nand many factors can cause the disease to worsen or relapse. \\nKnown triggers include anxiety and stress, climate (extremes \\nof temperature and humidity), irritants, allergens, and infec-\\ntions. Approximately 30% of infants and young children with \\neffectiveness. Nasal corticosteroid sprays have been used safely \\nin long-term therapy. Deleterious effects on adrenal function \\nor nasal membranes have not been reported when these agents \\nare used appropriately. The most common adverse effects include \\nlocal irritation, burning, and sneezing, which occur in 10% of \\npatients. Nasal bleeding from improper technique (spraying \\nthe nasal septum) can occur. Rare cases of nasal septal perfora-\\ntion have been reported.\\nAntihistamines are the medications used most frequently \\nto treat allergic rhinitis. They are useful in treating rhinorrhea, \\nsneezing, nasal itching, and ocular itching but are less helpful \\nin treating nasal congestion. First-generation antihistamines, \\nsuch as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine, easily cross the \\nblood-brain barrier with sedation as the most common reported \\nadverse effect. Use of first-generation antihistamines in children \\nhas an adverse effect on cognitive and academic function. In \\nvery young children, a paradoxical stimulatory central nervous \\nsystem effect resulting in irritability and restlessness has been \\nnoted. Other adverse effects of first-generation antihistamines \\ninclude anticholinergic effects, such as blurred vision, urinary \\nretention, dry mouth, tachycardia, and constipation. Second-\\ngeneration antihistamines, such as cetirizine, desloratadine, \\nfexofenadine, levocetirizine, and loratadine, are less likely to \\ncross the blood-brain barrier resulting in less sedation. Cetiri-\\nzine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and loratadine are available \\nwithout prescription. Azelastine and olopatadine, topical nasal \\nantihistamine sprays, are approved for children older than 5 \\nyears and 6 years, respectively.\\nDecongestants, taken orally or intranasally, may be used \\nto relieve nasal congestion. Oral medications, such as pseu-\\ndoephedrine and phenylephrine, are available either alone or \\nin combination with antihistamines. Adverse effects of oral \\ndecongestants include insomnia, nervousness, irritability, \\ntachycardia, tremors, and palpitations; oral decongestants are \\nnot recommended for children less than 4 years old. For older \\nchildren participating in sports, oral decongestant use may be \\nrestricted. Topical nasal decongestant sprays are effective for \\nimmediate relief of nasal obstruction but should not be used \\nmore than 3 consecutive days to prevent rhinitis medicamentosa.\\nTopical ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic nasal \\nspray, is used primarily for nonallergic rhinitis and rhinitis \\nassociated with viral upper respiratory infection. Leukotriene \\nmodifiers have been studied in the treatment of allergic \\nrhinitis. Montelukast is approved for use in seasonal allergic  \\nrhinitis.\\nImmunotherapy\\nIf environmental control measures and medication intervention \\nare only partially effective or produce unacceptable adverse \\neffects, immunotherapy may be recommended. The mechanism \\nof action for allergen immunotherapy is complex but includes \\nincreased production of an IgG-blocking antibody, decreased \\nproduction of specific IgE, and alteration of cytokine expression \\nproduced in response to an allergen challenge. Immunotherapy \\nis effective for desensitization to pollens, dust mites, and cat \\nand dog proteins. Use in young children may be limited by the \\nneed for frequent injections.

Skin biopsy is of little \\nvalue, but it may be performed to exclude other skin diseases \\nthat mimic atopic dermatitis. Skin testing or serum specific \\nIgE testing may be helpful in assessing the contribution of food \\nor environmental allergies to disease expression if history is \\nsuggestive.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMany conditions share signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis \\n(Table 80.2). Infants presenting in the first year of life with \\nfailure to thrive, recurrent skin or systemic infections, and \\nscaling, erythematous rash should be evaluated for immuno-\\ndeficiency disorders. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked \\nrecessive syndrome characterized by atopic dermatitis, throm-\\nbocytopenia, small-sized platelets, and recurrent infections. \\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis is characterized by hemorrhagic \\nor petechial lesions. Scabies is an intensely pruritic skin condition \\ncaused by the human scabies mite. The presence of burrows \\nin interdigital spaces and flexor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, \\naxilla, or genitals is pathognomonic. Burrows may be few in \\nnumber or absent, however.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe goals of eczema therapy are to reduce the number and \\nseverity of flares and to increase the number of disease-free \\nsevere atopic dermatitis have coexisting food allergies. The more \\nsevere the atopic dermatitis and the younger the patient, the \\nmore likely a food allergy will be identified as a contributing \\nfactor. Egg allergy is the most common cause of food-induced \\neczematous reactions.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe prevalence of atopic dermatitis increased two- to threefold \\nover the past 30 years. Approximately 15-20% of children and \\n2-10% of adults are affected. Atopic dermatitis often starts in \\nearly infancy. Approximately 50% of affected children show \\nsymptoms in the first year of life, and 80% experience disease \\nonset before 5 years of age. Atopic dermatitis is often the first \\nmanifestation of the atopic march. Approximately 80% of \\nchildren with atopic dermatitis develop other allergic diseases, \\nsuch as asthma or allergic rhinitis. Symptoms of dermatitis \\noften disappear at the onset of respiratory allergy.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis vary with age. \\nIn infants, atopic dermatitis involves the face, scalp, cheeks, \\nand extensor surfaces of the extremities (Fig. 80.1). The diaper \\narea is spared. In older children, the rash localizes to the \\nantecubital and popliteal fossae, head and neck. In adolescents \\nand adults, lichenified plaques are seen in flexural areas (Fig. \\n80.2) and head and neck regions. Pruritus has a significant \\nimpact on the child and family’s quality of life since it is often \\nworse at night, disturbing sleep.

Other environmental \\nexposures, such as dust mites, can also contribute to the disease \\nstate.\\nCHAPTER 81 \\nUrticaria, Angioedema,  \\nand Anaphylaxis\\nETIOLOGY\\nUrticaria, commonly referred to as hives, is swelling of the \\ndermis and one of the most common skin conditions seen in \\nclinical practice. Angioedema results from a process similar \\nto urticaria, but the reaction extends below the dermis. Urticaria \\nand angioedema occur in response to the release of inflammatory \\nmediators including histamine, leukotrienes, platelet-activating \\nfactor, prostaglandins, and cytokines from mast cells residing \\nin the skin. A variety of stimuli can trigger mast cells to release \\ntheir chemical mediators. Typically mast cells degranulate when \\nantigen cross links cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig)E. Release \\nof mediators results in vasodilation, increased vascular leak, \\nand pruritus. In addition, basophils from the peripheral blood \\ncan localize to tissue and release mediators. Patients with \\nurticaria have elevated histamine content in the skin that is \\nmore easily released.\\nAnaphylaxis is mediated by IgE, whereas anaphylactoid reac-\\ntions result from mechanisms that are due to nonimmunologic \\nmechanisms. Both reactions are acute, severe, and can be life \\nthreatening due to massive release of inflammatory mediators. \\nUrticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis are best considered as \\nsymptoms because they have a variety of causes.\\nNot all mast cell activation is IgE-mediated. Immunologic, \\nnonimmunologic, physical, and chemical stimuli can produce \\ndegranulation of mast cells and basophils. Anaphylatoxins, C3a \\nand C5a, can cause histamine release in a non–IgE-mediated \\nreaction. Anaphylatoxins are generated in serum sickness \\n(see Chapter 82) and in infectious, neoplastic, and rheumatic \\ndiseases. In addition, mast cell degranulation can occur from \\ndirect pharmacologic effect or physical or mechanical activa-\\ntion, such as urticaria after exposure to opiate medications or \\ndermatographism (see below).\\nUrticaria and angioedema can be classified into three sub -\\ncategories: acute, chronic, and physical. By definition acute \\nurticaria and angioedema are hives and diffuse swelling that \\nlast less than 6 weeks. Often the history is quite helpful in \\neliciting the cause of the acute reaction (Table 81.1). An IgE \\nmechanism is more commonly found in acute urticaria than \\nin chronic urticaria. In the pediatric population, viral illnesses \\nare responsible for the majority of acute urticaria.\\nChronic urticaria and angioedema are characterized by \\npersistence of symptoms beyond 6 weeks (Table 81.1). Some \\nhave daily symptoms of hives and swelling, whereas others have \\nintermittent or recurrent episodes. Chronic urticaria can be \\nOther less serious adverse effects include local burning sensation \\nand the need for sun protection.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nDefective cell-mediated immunity leads to increased susceptibil-\\nity to many bacterial, viral, and fungal infections of the skin. \\nMore than 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis have coloniza-\\ntion of lesional skin with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), \\nand more than 75% of patients have colonization of uninvolved \\nskin. Colonization and infection by S. aureus are associated \\nwith disease severity. S. aureus secretes exotoxins that act as \\nsuperantigens, stimulating T cells and increasing IgE production. \\nSecondarily infected atopic dermatitis often presents as impe-\\ntiginous, pustular lesions with crusting and honey-colored \\nexudate. Topical antibiotics, such as mupirocin or retapamulin, \\ncan be used to treat local areas of infection. Oral antibiotics \\nsuch as cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanate can \\nbe used for multifocal disease or for infection around the eyes \\nand mouth that is difficult to treat topically. Bacterial cultures \\nmay be helpful in patients who do not respond to oral antibiotics \\nor who have infection after multiple antibiotic courses. The \\nincidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus \\nis increasing.\\nHerpes simplex superinfection of affected skin, or Kaposi \\nvaricelliform eruption or eczema herpeticum, results in \\nvesiculopustular lesions that appear in clusters and can become \\nhemorrhagic. Herpes simplex virus infection can be misdiag-\\nnosed as bacterial infection and should be considered if skin \\nlesions fail to respond to antibiotics.\\nIn individuals with atopic dermatitis, smallpox vaccination \\nor exposure to a vaccinated individual may lead to eczema \\nvaccinatum, a localized vaccinial superinfection of affected \\nskin. Eczema vaccinatum may progress to generalized vac-\\ncinia with vaccinial lesions appearing at sites distant from the \\ninoculation. In patients with underlying immunodeficiencies, \\nthis complication may be life threatening.\\nWidespread infections with human papillomavirus (warts) \\nand molluscum contagiosum are also common in children with \\natopic dermatitis.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disorder that tends \\nto be more severe and prominent in young children. Symptoms \\nbecome less severe in two thirds of children, with complete \\nremission for approximately 20%. Early onset disease that is \\nmore widespread with concomitant asthma and allergic rhinitis, \\nfamily history of atopic dermatitis, and elevated serum IgE \\nlevels may predict a more persistent course. Patients and families \\nshould be taught that a single cause and cure for atopic dermatitis \\nis unlikely but that good control is possible for the majority of \\naffected patients.\\nPREVENTION\\nAn important step in the management of atopic dermatitis is \\nto identify and avoid allergens and irritants. Common irritants \\ninclude soaps, detergents, fragrances, chemicals, smoke, and \\nextremes of temperature and humidity. Since wool and synthetic \\nfabrics can be irritating to the skin, 100% cotton fabric is \\npreferred. Sweating is a recognized trigger. Fingernails should \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

HAE with normal C1 inhibitor (formerly known \\nas type III HAE) patients have normal laboratory evaluation of \\nC1-esterase inhibitor. These patients are more typically females. \\nTreatment for HAE is divided into on-demand treatment for \\nacute attacks and prophylaxis (Table 81.2). Prophylactic C1INH \\nconcentrate has advantage over other prophylactic therapies in \\nterms of availability, effectiveness, and side effects. Bradykinin \\nis an important mediator in the pathophysiology of HAE, and \\nnewer treatments are aimed at blocking this mediator.\\nAnaphylactic reactions are type I IgE-mediated reactions \\nand result from many causes (Table 81.3). Cross linking of \\ncell surface IgE by allergen leads to high-affinity IgE receptor \\nactivation on the mast cell and basophil resulting in release \\nof mediators, including histamine, tryptase, tumor necrosis \\nfactor, platelet-activating factor, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, \\nand cytokines. Other cell types involved in the reactions include \\nidiopathic with unknown causal factors. Thirty five to 40% of \\nchronic urticaria cases have an autoimmune process due to IgG \\nautoantibodies binding directly to IgE or the high-affinity IgE \\nreceptor. Physical urticaria and angioedema are characterized \\nby known eliciting external factors that may include pressure, \\ncold, heat, exercise, vibration, or exposure to sun.\\nThe most common physical urticaria is dermatographism, \\naffecting 2-5% of persons. Dermatographism means “writing \\non the skin” and is easily diagnosed by firmly scratching the skin \\nwith a blunt point, such as the wooden tip of a cotton swab or \\ntongue depressor. It is characterized by an urticarial reaction \\nlocalized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that \\ntrauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine \\nto be released from the mast cells.\\nCholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of \\n1-3 mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after \\nan increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in \\nyoung adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, \\nafter a hot bath, or with emotional stress. The lack of airway \\nsymptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis.\\nCold urticaria occurs with exposure to cold and may \\ndevelop within minutes on areas directly exposed to cold or \\non rewarming of the affected areas. Ingestion of cold drinks \\nmay precipitate lip swelling. Cold urticaria syndromes can be \\ncategorized into acquired and familial disorders. Severe reac-\\ntions resulting in death can occur with swimming or diving \\ninto cold water. Patients must never swim alone, should avoid \\ntotal body exposure to cold, and should have auto-injectable \\nepinephrine available.\\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant \\ndisease due to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. The genetic \\ndefect may be caused by spontaneous mutation since approxi-\\nmately 25% of cases occur in patients without any family history. \\nThe disease is estimated to affect approximately 10,000 persons in \\nthe United States. It is characterized by unpredictable, recurrent \\nattacks of episodic swelling that involves the face, peripheral \\nextremities, genitalia, abdomen, oropharynx, and pharynx. \\nEpisodes are often triggered by trauma. Asphyxiation from \\nlaryngeal attacks is a significant cause of mortality. Patients \\nwith HAE rarely have urticaria associated with angioedema, \\nand the swelling is not relieved with antihistamines or oral \\ncorticosteroids. The majority of patients (85%) have type I  \\ndisease, which is due to decreased production of C1-esterase \\ninhibitor. A minority of patients (15%) have type II disease, \\nwhich is due to production of dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibi-\\ntor. A low C4 level serves as an initial screening test. Patients \\nwith reduced C4 should have quantitative and functional levels \\nof C1-esterase inhibitor measured.

Generally, angioedema is not pruritic, may \\nbe mildly painful, and persists for longer than 24 hours. In \\nrare cases it may become life threatening if swelling affects the \\nupper airway.\\nThe clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid \\nreactions are the same for children and adults. The signs and \\nsymptoms vary and can range from mild skin findings to a \\nfatal reaction. Ninety percent of patients present with cuta-\\nneous symptoms, including urticaria, angioedema, flushing, \\nand warmth, but the absence of dermal symptoms does not \\nexclude the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Other affected organ \\nsystems include the respiratory tract (rhinorrhea, oropharyn-\\ngeal edema, laryngeal edema, hoarseness, stridor, wheezing, \\ndyspnea, and asphyxiation), cardiovascular system (tachycardia, \\nhypotension, shock, syncope, and arrhythmias), gastrointestinal \\ntract (nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting) and \\nneurological system (syncope, seizure, dizziness, and a sense \\nof impending doom). The severity of an anaphylactic reaction \\nis often proportionate to the speed of symptom onset.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe laboratory evaluation of patients with urticaria and angio-\\nedema must be tailored to the clinical situation. Acute urticaria \\nand angioedema do not require specific laboratory evaluation \\nexcept to document the suspected cause. For patients with \\nchronic urticaria and angioedema, current recommendations \\nadvise against routine lab testing unless history suggests a \\npotential etiology. Patients with recurrent angioedema without \\nurticaria should be evaluated for HAE (Table 81.4).\\nMeasurement of the mast cell mediators, histamine and \\ntryptase, may be helpful when the diagnosis of anaphylaxis \\nis in question. A tryptase level is a more useful test because \\nhistamine is released quickly, has a very short half-life, and is \\noften difficult to detect in the serum. Serum tryptase levels peak \\n1-1.5 hours after anaphylaxis. Elevated levels may be helpful in \\nestablishing the diagnosis, but normal tryptase levels do not rule \\nout the diagnosis. It is best to measure a serum tryptase level \\nmonocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and platelets. \\nThe mediator release results in the clinical picture of anaphylaxis.\\nAnaphylactoid reactions are due to nonimmunologic \\nmechanisms. Mast cells and basophils can be activated by \\ndirect, nonspecific stimulation, although the exact underlying \\nmechanism is unknown. Reactions to opiates and radiocontrast \\nmaterial are classic examples. Complement system activation also \\ncan result in mast cell and basophil activation. Anaphylatoxins, \\nC3a and C5a, are named because of their ability to trigger \\nmediator release and are generated in serum sickness. There are \\nother causes of anaphylactoid reactions for which the mechanism \\nhas not been clarified.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nUrticaria and angioedema are common skin conditions affecting \\n15-25% of individuals at some point in their lives. Most cases \\nof urticaria are self-limited, but for some patients, they are \\nchronic. In approximately 50% of patients, urticaria and \\nangioedema occur together.

Other immunomodulating agents, such as cyclo-\\nsporine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, \\nand intravenous immunoglobulin, have been used.

Early administra-\\ntion of intramuscular epinephrine is the mainstay of therapy \\nand should be given at the same time that basic measures of \\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation are being performed.

The biphasic reaction is a recurrence of \\nanaphylactic symptoms after an initial remission, occurring \\nwithin 8-72 hours after the initial reaction.

A referral to an allergy specialist \\nfor a thorough history, diagnostic testing if indicated, and \\n1-2 hours after the onset of symptoms. It also can be measured \\nretrospectively on stored serum that is less than 2 days old.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis of urticaria and angioedema is straightforward; \\nfinding the etiology may be more difficult. Other dermatologic \\nconditions can mimic urticaria. Erythema multiforme has \\ntarget-shaped, erythematous, macular, or papular lesions that \\nmay look similar to urticaria, but the lesions are fixed and last \\nfor several days. Other dermatologic diseases such as dermatitis \\nherpetiformis and bullous pemphigoid are quite pruritic, and \\nearly on, the lesions may resemble urticaria. Mastocytosis is \\ncharacterized by mast cell infiltration of various organs, including \\nthe skin. Some patients have skin lesions similar in appearance \\nto urticaria rather than the classic urticaria pigmentosa. Urticaria \\npigmentosa appears as hyperpigmented, red-brown macules \\nthat may coalesce. When these lesions are stroked, they urticate, \\nwhich is called the Darier sign. A rare disorder that should \\nbe included in the differential diagnosis of urticaria is Muckle-\\nWells syndrome. It is an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory \\ndisorder characterized by episodic urticaria presenting in infancy \\nwith sensorineural deafness, amyloidosis, arthralgias, and skeletal \\nabnormalities. Another rare syndrome is Schnitzler syndrome, \\nwhich is characterized by chronic urticaria, macroglobulinemia, \\nbone pain, anemia, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Urticarial \\nvasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis with histological features \\nof a leukocytoclastic response. The main distinguishing feature \\nis that the lesions last longer than 24 hours, may be tender, \\nand leave behind skin pigmentation. Skin biopsy is required \\nfor definitive diagnosis.\\nThe diagnosis of anaphylaxis is usually apparent from the \\nacute and often dramatic onset of multisystem involvement of \\nthe skin, respiratory tract, and cardiovascular system. Sudden \\ncardiovascular collapse in the absence of cutaneous symptoms \\nsuggests vasovagal collapse, seizure disorder, aspiration, pul-\\nmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction. Laryngeal edema, \\nespecially with abdominal pain, suggests HAE.

Although children \\nare stung more frequently than adults, systemic allergic reactions \\noccur in only about 1% of children and 3% of adults. Reactions \\nin adults are generally more severe than in children and can \\nresult in death. Large local reactions to insect stings are more \\ncommon in children, with an estimated incidence of 20% for \\nchildren and 10% for adults.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe diagnosis of insect sting allergy is dependent on the history \\nof the reaction and the presence of venom-specific IgE. Normal \\nreactions to insect stings, which are observed in 90% of children, \\ninclude localized pain, swelling, and erythema at the sting site \\nthat usually subside within 24 hours. Large local reactions occur \\nin approximately 10% of patients. They are usually late-phase, \\nIgE-mediated reactions, with large swelling, contiguous to the \\nsting site that develops over 24-48 hours and resolves within \\n2-7 days. Virtually all individuals with large local reactions \\nhave similar reactions with subsequent stings. Systemic reactions \\nare IgE mediated and occur in 1% of children. They can be \\nmild and nonlife-threatening with cutaneous symptoms only \\nor life-threatening with respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic \\nsymptoms of anaphylaxis (see Chapter 81). Toxic reactions \\nmay result if a person receives a large number of simultaneous \\nstings (50-100). Symptoms include malaise, nausea, and emesis \\nresulting from the toxic effects of the venom. Unusual reactions, \\nsuch as vasculitis, nephrosis, neuritis, serum sickness, and \\nencephalitis, rarely are associated with insect stings (Table 83.1).\\nThe symptoms of serum sickness typically occur 7-21 days \\nafter the administration of drugs, foreign proteins, or infections. \\nSymptom onset may be more rapid (within 1-4 days) in previ-\\nously sensitized individuals. The classic clinical manifestations \\nconsist of fever, polyarticular arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, \\nand cutaneous symptoms. Cutaneous lesions vary and may \\ninclude urticaria, angioedema, erythema multiforme, morbil-\\nliform rash, and palpable purpura or serpiginous rash at the \\ninterface of the dorsal and palmar or plantar aspects of the \\nhands and feet. Carditis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barre \\nsyndrome, encephalomyelitis, and peripheral neuritis are rare \\ncomplications.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nLaboratory tests may show an elevated erythrocyte sedi -\\nmentation rate, presence of circulating immune complexes, \\nand depressed complement (C3 and C4) levels. Skin biopsy \\nspecimens show immune deposits of IgM, IgA, IgE, or C3. \\nHematuria or proteinuria or both may be present. The diagnosis \\nis established by history of exposure to an inciting cause, char-\\nacteristic clinical manifestations, and laboratory testing showing \\ncirculating immune complexes and depressed complement  \\nlevels.\\nTREATMENT AND PREVENTION\\nSerum sickness is self-limited and resolves within 1-2 weeks. \\nTherefore treatment is symptomatic relief. Antihistamines may \\nbe administered to relieve pruritus. Nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs reduce fever and joint pain, and if necessary, \\nprednisone (1-2  m g/kg orally daily) is administered with a \\ntapering dose. Allergy skin testing does not predict the likelihood \\nof serum sickness development and is not indicated.\\nThe primary means of prevention is to avoid exposure to \\nthe implicated cause.\\nCHAPTER 83 \\nInsect Allergies\\nETIOLOGY\\nSystemic allergic reactions usually result from stinging insects \\nof the order Hymenoptera, which include apids (honeybee \\nand bumblebee), vespids (yellow jacket, wasp, yellow-face and \\nwhite-face hornets), and formicids (fire and harvester ants). \\nHoneybees have a barbed stinger that remains embedded after \\na sting. Y ellow jackets are responsible for most allergic reactions \\nin most parts of the United States, whereas wasps are the most \\nfrequent cause of sting reactions in Texas. Fire ants are found \\nin southeastern and south central United States.\\nBiting insects rarely cause anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis has been \\ndescribed, however, after the bites from the kissing bug Triatoma, \\nbed bugs, blackflies, and deerflies. Large local reactions from \\nbiting insects, such as mosquitoes, fleas, and flies, are a more \\ncommon occurrence. The reaction appears urticarial and is \\ncaused by the salivary secretions deposited by the biting insect \\nand does not represent an allergic response.\\nTABLE 83.1 Classification of Insect Sting Reactions\\nREACTION TYPE CHARACTERISTICS\\nNormal <2 inches in diameter\\nTransient pain and erythema\\nDuration <24 hr\\nLarge local reaction >2 inches in diameter\\nSwelling contiguous to the site\\nDuration 2-7 days\\nSystemic\\nNonlife-threatening Immediate generalized reaction confined \\nto the skin (erythema, urticaria, \\nangioedema)\\nLife-threatening Immediate generalized reaction not \\nconfined to the skin with respiratory \\n(laryngeal edema, bronchospasm) or \\ncardiovascular (hypotension, shock) \\nsymptoms\\nToxic Follows multiple simultaneous stings, \\nproduced by exogenous vasoactive \\namines in venom\\nUnusual Serum sickness, vasculitis, nephrosis, \\nneuritis, encephalitis\\nSymptoms start several days to weeks \\nafter the insect sting.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Approximately one \\nhalf of deaths occur in persons without a previous history of \\na sting reaction.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nSuccessfully avoiding the stinging insect is the most important \\nprognostic factor. More than 85% of adults who complete 5 \\nyears of immunotherapy tolerate sting challenges without \\nsystemic reactions for 5-10 years after completion.\\nPREVENTION\\nMeasures to reduce the chance of accidental sting include \\nexterminating infested areas, avoid eating or drinking outdoors, \\nwearing long pants and shoes, and avoiding brightly colored \\nclothing, fragrances, or hairspray when outdoors. Common \\ninsect repellents are not effective against Hymenoptera.\\nCurrent recommendations are to administer venom \\nimmunotherapy to individuals who have had a systemic life-\\nthreatening reaction from an insect sting and have positive \\nvenom skin tests or elevated venom-specific IgE. All persons \\nwith a history of systemic reactions to stinging insects should \\nbe instructed in the use of an epinephrine auto-injector and \\nencouraged to wear medical information jewelry. Children \\nyounger than 16 years of age who have had only a cutaneous \\nreaction generally do not require immunotherapy because their \\nrisk of life-threatening reaction is low.\\nCHAPTER 84 \\nAdverse Reactions to Foods\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAn adverse reaction to food  is a generic description of any \\nuntoward reaction after food ingestion, including toxic reactions \\nsuch as food poisoning and nontoxic reactions, which can be \\nsubdivided further into nonimmune and immune reactions. \\nLactose intolerance represents a nonimmune reaction. Food \\nallergy or hypersensitivity reactions encompass immune reac-\\ntions to food and can be divided further into immunoglobulin \\n(Ig)E-mediated reactions, which are typically rapid in onset, \\nand non-IgE-mediated reactions.\\nOral tolerance is the suppression of the immune response \\nto the array of dietary elements ingested daily. Food allergy or \\nhypersensitivity reactions are the result of immune reactions to \\nglycoproteins and develop in genetically predisposed individuals. \\nIn children, cow’s milk, eggs, peanuts, soybean, wheat, tree \\nnuts, fish, and shellfish cause 90% of IgE-mediated reactions. \\nIn older children and adults, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and \\nshellfish account for most reactions. Exposure to the allergenic \\nfood protein results in cross linking of cell surface specific \\nIgE molecules found on mast cells and basophils resulting in \\nactivation and degranulation. Numerous potent mediators and \\ncytokines are released. Non-IgE-mediated reactions typically \\noccur hours to days after the allergen ingestion and manifest as \\ngastrointestinal symptoms. A cell-mediated immune mechanism \\nmay be responsible.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nA positive skin test to Hymenoptera venom extract demonstrates \\nthe presence of venom-specific IgE and in the context of a \\npositive sting reaction history helps identify specific insects to \\nwhich an individual is allergic. Venom-specific IgE antibodies \\nalso may be measured by in vitro serum tests. Both testing \\nmethods should be considered complementary because neither \\ntest alone detects all patients with insect sting allergy. Future \\nreactions correlate more with past individual patterns than the \\nlevel of sensitivity of venom skin testing or serum specific IgE \\ntesting.\\nPediatric patients presenting with history of anaphylaxis to \\nstinging insect venoms require evaluation of a baseline tryptase \\nlevel to screen for an underlying mast cell disorder in addition \\nto assessment of specific IgE. Patients with mast cell disorders \\nare at higher risk for severe reactions to stings. Likewise, they are \\nmore likely to have no skin manifestations during their reaction, \\nsystemic reactions to vespid stings, hypotensive anaphylaxis, and \\nnegative evaluation of specific IgE despite a highly suggestive \\nhistory. Mast cell disorders have further implications for venom \\nimmunotherapy. During immunotherapy, these patients have \\nhigher risk of side effects, higher risk of systemic sting reactions, \\nand higher risk of relapse after discontinuing therapy. They \\nshould receive venom immunotherapy indefinitely.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nA history of an immediate systemic reaction is necessary before \\nvenom testing and consideration of immunotherapy. Testing \\nfor venom-specific IgE without a history of a systemic reaction \\nto a sting is not recommended. Identification of the offending \\ninsect is often unreliable. Honeybee stings may be identified \\nby the stinger that remains in place. Vespid stings are usually \\nunprovoked and occur at summer’s end when the insects are \\nmore aggressive.\\nTREATMENT\\nLocal reactions should be treated by cleaning the site, applying \\ncold compresses, and administering oral antihistamines and \\nanalgesics. Occasionally, large local reactions may be mistaken \\nfor cellulitis. Infection is unlikely if reaction occurs within 24-48 \\nhours after a sting. Treatment is with an oral corticosteroid for \\n4-5 days rather than oral antibiotics.\\nTreatment of systemic reactions is guided by the severity \\nof the reaction, but epinephrine is the cornerstone of therapy \\nand should be administered without delay. Antihistamines may  \\nbe administered concurrently with epinephrine. Corticoster -\\noids should be given to prevent recurrent or prolonged symp-\\ntoms. For severe reactions, intravenous fluids and epinephrine, \\noxygen, and respiratory support in an intensive care unit \\nmay be needed. After acute care of a systemic sting reaction, \\npatients should be provided an epinephrine auto-injector, \\nreferral to an allergist, and instructions on prevention of  \\ninsect stings.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nAt least 50-100 fatalities per year in the United States are \\nattributed to insect sting reactions. Most deaths (80%) occur \\nin adults older than 40 years of age, but only 2% occur in \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

There is no role for antihistamines in this setting \\nbecause the severity of the reaction is unpredictable. There are \\napproximately 100 deaths per year due to food allergies, and \\nmost cases are secondary to a delay or no administration of \\nepinephrine.\\nNovel therapies for IgE-mediated food allergy are currently \\nbeing investigated to either desensitize patients to food allergens \\nor induce tolerance. Oral immunotherapy entails ingesting \\nincreasing amounts of the food allergen to achieve desensitiza-\\ntion. Sublingual immunotherapy requires placing increasing \\ndoses of food allergen under the tongue. This treatment has \\nbeen shown to be effective for desensitization, but compliance \\nis poor. In epicutaneous therapy, food allergens are embedded \\nin a patch that is applied to the skin. While still in clinical \\ntrials, these therapies may become common clinical practice \\nwithin this century.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nAnaphylaxis is the most serious complication of allergic food \\nreactions and can result in death (see Chapter 81). Patients \\nalso need to be monitored for alterations in growth and potential \\nnutritional deficiencies from food avoidance. This is especially \\nimportant for children avoiding multiple foods or if one of \\ntheir food allergens is cow’s milk.\\nPROGNOSIS AND PREVENTION\\nThe natural history of food allergies or “is my child going to \\noutgrow this?” is a common concern of parents. With new \\ndata, counseling parents on the future likelihood of developing \\noral tolerance to a food allergen has changed over the last \\nseveral years and for some foods is multifactorial. For cow’s \\nmilk allergic patients who have multiple food allergies, asthma, \\nand allergic rhinitis, 21% of patients will have persistent milk \\nallergy at age 16 years. But 85% of children who do not have \\nadditional atopic disease develop cow’s milk tolerance by 3 \\nyears of age. Similarly, 66% of children with egg allergy but no \\nother atopic disease develop tolerance by 5 years of age, but \\n32% of those with additional atopic disease will still be sensitive \\nto egg by age 16 years. The natural histories of soy and wheat \\nallergy are similar: oral tolerance in 25-29% by age 4 years, \\n45-56% by age 6 or 8 years, and 65-69% by age 10 or 12 years. \\nPreviously, most children with peanut allergy were thought to \\nnearly never develop oral tolerance. However, 20% of children \\nwith peanut allergy outgrow their allergy. Nine percent of tree \\nnut allergic patients will develop oral tolerance. Food allergies \\nto seafood continue to be a lifelong affliction.\\nAvoidance of the suspect food is crucial. Careful reading \\nof food labels is a priority. Medical information jewelry with \\nappropriate information should be worn. The Food Allergy \\nResearch & Education organization (www.foodallergy.org) is \\na useful educational resource for families and physicians.\\nRecommendations for prevention of allergic diseases aimed \\nat the high-risk newborn who has not manifested atopic disease \\ninclude (1) exclusive breast feeding for the first 4-6 months or \\n(2) using an extensively hydrolyzed formula for the first 4-6 \\nmonths and introducing solid foods between 4 and 6 months \\nof age. Other approaches, such as maternal avoidance diets \\nduring pregnancy and during lactation, as well as avoidance \\nof allergenic foods for infants beyond 6 months of age, are \\nunproven.\\ndiscouraged. A negative skin test virtually excludes an IgE-\\nmediated mechanism. A positive skin test indicates sensitization \\nbut does not prove clinical reactivity and must be interpreted \\nin the context of the history.\\nAn in vitro serum-specific IgE assay can be used to help \\nconfirm clinical allergy as well. Many allergists and laboratories \\nregard the ImmunoCAP system as the method of choice. This \\nmethod uses a quantitative fluorescent immunoassay, which is \\nmore sensitive and has improved specificity and reproducibility \\ncompared to other assays. These tests provide supplementary \\ninformation to skin tests. Researchers have tried to determine \\nlevels of food-specific IgE at which clinical reactions are highly \\nlikely to occur (Table 84.2). Patients with allergen-specific IgE \\nlevels greater than 95% of the predictive value will likely be \\nsymptomatic upon ingestion, so an oral food challenge is not \\nnecessary. Monitoring the allergen-specific IgE level and/or \\nwheal size on skin prick testing may be helpful in predicting \\nwhether a child has outgrown the food allergy. Oral food chal-\\nlenges remain the standard of diagnosis and can be performed \\nto determine whether a child has developed oral tolerance to \\nthe food allergen.\\nComponent resolved diagnostics (CRD) have gained attention \\nin the area of food allergy testing. CRD refers to a testing \\nmethod employing allergens purified from natural sources or \\nrecombinant DNA technology.

Approximately 6-10% of children are labeled as \\npenicillin allergic. Risk factors for drug reactions include previous \\ndrug exposure, increasing age (>20 years of age), parenteral or \\ntopical administration, higher dose, intermittent repeated \\nexposure, and a genetic predisposition of slow drug metabolism. \\nAn atopic background does not predispose an individual to \\nthe development of drug reactions but may indicate a greater \\nrisk of serious reaction.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAllergic reactions can be classified as immediate (anaphylactic) \\nreactions, which occur within 60 minutes of drug administra-\\ntion; accelerated reactions, which begin 1-72 hours after drug \\nadministration; and late reactions, which occur after 72 hours. \\nThe most common form of adverse drug reaction is cutaneous. \\nAccelerated reactions are usually dermatologic or serum sickness \\nreactions. Late reactions include desquamating dermatitis, \\nStevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and \\nserum sickness.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nSkin testing protocols are standardized for penicillin and are \\nwell described for other agents, such as local anesthetics, muscle \\nrelaxants, vaccines, and insulin.

Likewise, the Persistence of Oral Tolerance to Peanut \\n(LEAP-On) trial revealed that this effect is durable.\\nCHAPTER 85 \\nAdverse Reactions to Drugs\\nETIOLOGY\\nAn adverse drug reaction is defined as an unwanted, negative \\nconsequence associated with the use of a drug or biologic agent. \\nDrug reactions can be classified as immunologic or nonim-\\nmunologic reactions (Table 85.1). Nearly 75-80% of adverse \\ndrug reactions are caused by a predictable, nonimmunologic \\nmechanism, and between 5 and 10% of all drug reactions are \\nexplained by an immune-mediated mechanism (Table 77.1). \\nThe remaining drug reactions are caused by an unpredictable \\nmechanism, which may or may not be immune-mediated. Many \\ndrug reactions cannot be classified because the exact immune \\nmechanism has not been defined. Most drugs cannot elicit an \\nimmune response because of their small size; rather, the drug \\nor a metabolite acts as a hapten and binds to larger molecules, \\nsuch as tissue or serum proteins, a process called haptenation. \\nThe multivalent hapten-protein complex forms a new immu -\\nnogenic epitope that stimulates T and B lymphocyte responses.\\nTABLE 85.1 Classification of Adverse Drug Reactions\\nTYPE EXAMPLE\\nIMMUNOLOGIC\\nType I reaction (IgE-mediated) Anaphylaxis from β-lactam antibiotic\\nType II reaction (cytotoxic) Hemolytic anemia from cephalosporins\\nType III reaction (immune complex) Serum sickness from antithymocyte globulin\\nType IV reaction (delayed, cell-mediated) Contact dermatitis from topical antihistamine\\nSpecific T-cell activation Morbilliform rash from sulfonamides\\nFas/Fas ligand-induced apoptosis Stevens-Johnson syndrome; toxic epidermal necrolysis\\nOther Drug-induced lupus-like syndrome; anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome\\nNONIMMUNOLOGIC\\nPredictable\\nPharmacologic adverse effect Dry mouth from antihistamines; tremor from albuterol\\nSecondary pharmacologic adverse effect Thrush while taking antibiotics; Clostridium difficile-associated colitis (pseudomembranous \\ncolitis) from clindamycin (and other antibiotics)\\nDrug toxicity Hepatotoxicity from methotrexate\\nDrug-drug interactions Increased carbamazepine levels with clarithromycin\\nDrug overdose Hepatic necrosis from acetaminophen\\nUnpredictable\\nPseudoallergic Anaphylactoid reaction after radiocontrast media\\nIdiosyncratic Hemolytic anemia in a patient with G6PD deficiency after primaquine therapy\\nIntolerance Tinnitus after a single, small dose of aspirin\\nG6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\\nModified from Riedl MA, Casillas AM.

Medical informa-\\ntion jewelry with appropriate information should be worn. In \\nthe medical community, responsible antibiotic use has been \\nemphasized to improve patient outcomes, decrease selection \\nfor resistant organisms, and minimize spread of multidrug \\nresistant organisms. Ideally, sensitive and specific testing to \\nany drug for allergy evaluation is highly desirable. However, \\nstandardized testing reagents do not exist except for penicillin. \\nThe penicillin family of antimicrobials are very effective to \\ntreat a multitude of pediatric infections.

Penicillin allergy should be evaluated when \\nthe individual is well and not in acute need of treatment. \\nPenicillin skin testing is helpful for IgE-mediated reactions \\nbecause of its negative predictive value; only 1-3% of patients \\nwith negative skin tests have a reaction, which is mild, when \\nre-exposed to penicillin. Skin testing for penicillin should be \\nperformed using the major determinant, penicilloyl polylysine \\n(available as Pre-Pen [ALK-Abelló, Inc, Hørsholm, Denmark]), \\nand minor determinants, which include penicillin G, penicil-\\nloate, and penilloate. Skin testing to penicillin does not predict \\nnon-IgE-mediated reactions. For patients with a history con-\\nsistent with serum sickness or desquamative-type reactions, \\nskin testing should not be performed and penicillin should be \\navoided indefinitely.\\nThe risk of having an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in a \\nchild who has reacted positively to penicillin skin testing is less \\nthan 2%. It is believed that the first-generation cephalosporins \\nare more likely than second-generation or third-generation \\ncephalosporins to be cross-reactive. This is due to the chemical \\nsimilarity of side chains of the β-lactam ring between penicillin \\nand first-generation cephalosporins.\\nTREATMENT\\nIf penicillin skin testing is positive, penicillin should be avoided, \\nand an alternative antibiotic should be used. If there is a definite \\nneed for penicillin, desensitization can be accomplished by \\nadministration of increasing amounts of drug over a short time \\nin a hospital setting. The exact mechanism of desensitization \\nis unclear; however, it is thought to render mast cells unre-\\nsponsive to the drug. To maintain desensitization, the drug \\nmust be given at least twice daily. If the drug is stopped for \\nlonger than 48 hours, the patient is no longer desensitized and \\nthe same protocol must be repeated before continuing antibiotic \\nuse.\\nFor other antibiotics, the relevant allergenic determinants \\nproduced by metabolism or degradation are not well defined. \\nSkin testing to the native antibiotic in nonirritating concentra-\\ntions can be performed. However, a negative response does not \\nexclude allergy while a positive response suggests the presence \\nof IgE-mediated allergy. In the case of a negative skin test \\nresponse, a graded challenge or test dose may be administered, \\ndepending on the clinical history of the reaction. Patients who \\nhave experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal \\nnecrolysis, or serum sickness should not be challenged.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nAnaphylaxis is the most serious complication of IgE-mediated \\ndrug reactions and can result in death (see Chapter 81).\\nPROGNOSIS\\nMost drug reactions do not seem to be allergic in nature. \\nRepeated, intermittent exposure during childhood or early \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Upon binding of antigen to these antibodies, \\nchemical mediators such as histamine, tryptase, leukotrienes, \\nand prostaglandins are released, resulting in allergic symp-\\ntoms, the most serious syndrome being anaphylaxis.\\n• Type II cytotoxic antibody reactions occur when antibodies \\n(IgM, IgG, or IgA) bind to cell surface antigens causing \\ncomplement activation and ultimately, cell lysis, or release \\nof anaphylatoxins. Examples of Type II disease are hemolytic \\nanemia and Goodpasture syndrome.\\n• Type III immune complex reactions result when antigen-\\nantibody complexes are formed causing injury to vasculature \\nand organs such as liver, spleen, and kidney. The classic \\nType III reaction is serum sickness.\\n• Type IV delayed type hypersensitivity reactions result when \\nT cells recognize antigens in the context of major histocom-\\npatibility complex class II, which activates cytokine release. \\nContact dermatitis to poison ivy represents an example of \\nType IV delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.\\n• The history, family history, and physical examination may \\nindicate existing atopic disease in patients.\\n• Allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and food allergies are \\nexamples of atopic disease involving IgE antibodies.\\n• Of the two methods for assessing antigen-specific IgE \\nantibodies, in vivo skin testing (via prick or intradermal \\ntesting) is the most sensitive method. Serum-based testing \\nwith quantitative fluorescent immunoassay proves to be \\nuseful in those patients unable to have skin testing performed \\nsuch as dermatographism or extensive dermatitis.\\n• The presence of specific IgE antibodies does not equate to \\ndiagnosis of allergic disease. Rather, positive results must \\nbe correlated with the history. Therefore obtaining screening \\ntests of multiple allergens is not recommended.\\nCHAPTER 78\\nAsthma\\n• Asthma involves many different cells, chemical mediators, \\nand chemotactic factors resulting in airway inflammation \\nand airway hyperresponsiveness. Typical symptoms included \\ncough, wheeze, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.\\n• Evaluation of patients with asthma should include history, \\nresponse to treatment, spirometry (>5 years of age), allergy \\ntesting, and chest radiograph, if warranted.\\n• Treatment of asthma involves numerous interventions: \\nenvironmental control of potential allergens, patient and \\ncare giver education, reduction of exposure to nonspecific \\nirritants such as secondhand tobacco smoke, pharmacologic \\ntherapy, and yearly influenza vaccination.\\n• To relieve smooth muscle airway bronchoconstriction, \\nshort-acting β2 agonists should be employed on an as-needed \\nbasis and/or prior to physical activity.\\n• The most effective antiinflammatory pharmacologic therapy \\nfor persistent asthma is inhaled corticosteroids, emphasizing \\nfinding the minimum dose that is able to achieve control \\nand minimize risk and impairment from the disease.\\n• All metered-dose inhalers need to be administered with the \\nuse of an aerochamber to maximize lung deposition of the \\nmedication.\\n• For some patients with more severe asthma, additional \\ntherapies may be required to achieve treatment goals: \\ncombination therapy with long-acting β2 agonists, leukotriene \\nmodifiers, theophylline, omalizumab and other biologic \\nagents, anticholinergic agents, allergen immunotherapy, and \\noral corticosteroids.\\n• Use of peak flow monitoring and written asthma action \\nplans may assist patients and their parents with at-home \\nmonitoring and adherence to medical therapy.\\n• Asthma exacerbations may be treated with frequent admin-\\nistration of short acting bronchodilators and a course of \\nsystemic corticosteroids. Despite these interventions, status \\nasthmaticus may ensue, requiring supplemental oxygen, \\ncontinuous bronchodilation, intravenous corticosteroids, \\nblood gas monitoring, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization.\\nCHAPTER 79\\nAllergic Rhinitis\\n• Allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis are IgE-mediated atopic \\ndiseases in response to relevant aeroallergens in a perennial \\nand/or seasonal fashion. Common symptoms include nasal \\npruritus, sneezing, clear rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, \\nlacrimation, ocular pruritus, and conjunctival injection.\\n• Like asthma, treatment for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis \\nemploys numerous modalities: education, avoidance of \\ntriggers, pharmacologic therapy, and immunotherapy.\\n• The most effective pharmacologic class of medications for \\nthe treatment of allergic rhinitis is intranasal corticosteroids. \\nWhen used properly, these sprays are efficacious and have \\nno effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Other \\ntreatments include oral and nasal antihistamines, oral \\ndecongestants, and leukotriene modifiers.\\nCHAPTER 80\\nAtopic Dermatitis\\n• Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing skin condition \\ncharacterized by pruritus and skin inflammation.

Haftel\\nCHAPTER 86 \\nRheumatic Assessment\\nThe rheumatic diseases (collagen vascular or connective tissue \\ndiseases) of childhood are characterized by autoimmunity and \\ninflammation, which may be localized or generalized. The classic \\nrheumatic diseases of children include juvenile idiopathic \\narthritis (JIA), formerly called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, \\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and juvenile dermato -\\nmyositis (JDM). Vasculitis is a component of many rheumatic \\ndiseases. Musculoskeletal pain syndromes are a set of overlap-\\nping conditions characterized by poorly localized pain involving \\nthe extremities. Scleroderma, Behçet syndrome, and Sjögren \\nsyndrome are rare in childhood. The differential diagnosis of \\nrheumatological disorders typically includes infections, postin-\\nfectious processes, and malignancies (Table 86.1).\\nHISTORY\\nThe history can identify symptoms that reflect the source of \\nthe inflammation, including whether it is localized or systemic. \\nSymptoms of systemic inflammation tend to be nonspecific. \\nFever, caused by cytokine release, can take many patterns. A \\nhectic fever, without periodicity or pattern, is commonly found \\nin vasculitides such as Kawasaki disease but also occurs in \\nchildren with underlying infection. Certain illnesses, such as \\nsystemic JIA, produce a patterned fever with regular temperature \\nspikes once or twice a day. Other rheumatic illnesses cause \\nlow-grade fevers. Charting the child’s fever pattern, particularly \\nin the absence of antipyretics, is useful. Rashes occur in many \\nforms, from evanescent to fixed and scarring (see Table 86.1). \\nOther systemic symptoms (malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and \\nfatigue) can vary from mild to debilitating.\\nSymptoms of localized inflammation vary depending on \\nthe involved site. Arthritis, or inflammation of the synovium \\n(synovitis), leads to joint pain, swelling, and impaired ability to \\nuse the affected joint. Morning stiffness or gelling is commonly \\ndescribed. The child may be slow to arise in the morning or \\nafter long periods of inactivity and may have a limp. Children \\nmay refrain from usual activities and athletics. Enthesitis is \\ninflammation at the insertion of a ligament to a bone. Serositis, \\ninflammation of serosal lining such as pleuritis, pericarditis, \\nor peritonitis, gives rise to chest pain, shortness of breath, \\nor abdominal pain. Myositis, inflammation of the muscle, \\nmay lead to symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, or difficulty \\nperforming tasks of daily living. Vasculitis, inflammation of the \\nblood vessels, leads to nonspecific symptoms of rash (petechiae, \\npurpura) and edema when small vessels deep in the papillary \\ndermis are involved; involvement of medium-sized vessels results \\nin a circumscribed tender nodule.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nA thorough history and physical examination is frequently \\nsufficient to narrow the differential diagnosis and elicit the \\ndiagnosis. The child’s overall appearance, evidence of growth \\nfailure, or failure to thrive may point to a significant underlying \\ninflammatory disorder. The head and neck examination may \\nshow evidence of mucosal ulceration, seen in diseases such as \\nSLE. The eye examination may show pupillary irregularity and \\nsynechiae from uveitis or the nonpurulent conjunctivitis of \\nKawasaki disease. Diffuse lymphadenopathy may be found and \\nis nonspecific. The respiratory and cardiac examinations may \\nshow pericardial or pleural friction rubs, indicating serositis. \\nSplenomegaly or hepatomegaly raises suspicion of activation \\nof the reticuloendothelial system that occurs in systemic JIA \\nor SLE.\\nThe joint examination is crucial for the diagnosis of arthritis \\nand may identify evidence of inflammation, such as joint swell-\\ning, effusion, tenderness, and erythema from increased blood \\nflow. Joint contractures may be seen if the process is chronic. \\nThe joint lining, or synovium, may be thickened from chronic \\ninflammation. Activation of epiphyseal growth plates in an \\narea of arthritis can lead to localized bony proliferation and \\nlimb length discrepancies. Conversely, inflammation at sites \\nof immature growth centers may lead to maldevelopment of \\nbones, such as the carpals or tarsals, resulting in crowding, \\nor the temporomandibular joints, resulting in micrognathia. \\nA rash or evidence of underlying skin disorders, such as skin \\nthickening from scleroderma or sclerodactyly, may be noted. \\nChronic Raynaud phenomenon may result in nail fold capillary \\nchanges, ulceration, or digital tuft wasting.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe rheumatic diseases of childhood encompass a heterogeneous \\ngroup of diseases with a shared underlying pathogenesis: \\ndisordered functioning of the immune system leading to \\ninflammation directed against native proteins, with secondary \\nincreases in numbers of activated lymphocytes, inflammatory \\ncytokines, and circulating antibodies. This antibody production \\ncan be nonspecific, or it can be targeted against specific native \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

It occurs primarily in children 3-15 \\nyears of age, although it has been described in adults. HSP is \\nslightly more common in boys than girls and occurs more \\nfrequently in the winter than in the summer months.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nproteins, leading to subsequent disease manifestations (Table \\n86.2). Although immune system hyperactivity may be self-\\nlimited, the hallmark of most rheumatic diseases of childhood \\nis chronicity, or the perpetuation of the inflammatory process, \\nwhich can lead to long-term disability.\\nINITIAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION\\nAlthough rheumatic diseases sometimes present with nonspecific \\nsymptoms, especially early in the course, over time a charac-\\nteristic set of symptoms and physical findings can be elicited. \\nIn conjunction with carefully chosen confirmatory laboratory \\ntests, an appropriate differential diagnosis is made, and eventually \\nthe correct diagnosis and treatment plan is developed.\\nMost rheumatological diagnoses are established by clinical \\nfindings and fulfillment of classification criteria. Laboratory \\ntesting should be judicious and based on a differential diagnosis \\nrather than random screening in search of a diagnosis.

Testing the stool for blood may identify evidence \\nof gut ischemia. Any question of gut perforation requires \\nradiological investigation.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis of HSP is based on the presence of two of four \\ncriteria (Table 87.1), which provides 87.1% sensitivity and 87.7% \\nspecificity for the disease. The differential diagnosis includes \\nother systemic vasculitides (Table 87.2) and diseases associated \\nwith thrombocytopenic purpura, such as idiopathic thrombo-\\ncytopenic purpura and leukemia.\\nHSP is characterized by rash, arthritis, and less frequently \\ngastrointestinal or renal vasculitis. The hallmark of HSP is \\npalpable purpura, caused by small vessel inflammation in the \\nskin, leading to extravasation of blood into the surrounding \\ntissues, frequently with IgA deposition. The rash is classically \\nfound in dependent areas: below the waist, on the buttocks, \\nand lower extremities (Fig. 87.1). The rash can begin as small \\nmacules or urticarial lesions but rapidly progresses to purpura \\nwith areas of ecchymosis. The rash also can be accompanied \\nby edema, particularly of the calves and dorsum of the feet, \\nscalp, and scrotum or labia. HSP occasionally is associated with \\nencephalopathy, pancreatitis, and orchitis.\\nArthritis occurs in 80% of patients with HSP and is most \\ncommon in the lower extremities, particularly the ankles and \\nknees. The arthritis is acute and very painful, with refusal to \\nbear weight. Joint swelling can be confused with peripheral \\nedema seen with the rash of HSP .\\nGastrointestinal involvement occurs in about one half of \\naffected children and most typically presents as mild to moder-\\nate crampy abdominal pain, thought to be due to small vessel \\ninvolvement of the gastrointestinal tract leading to ischemia. Less \\ncommonly, significant abdominal distention, bloody diarrhea, \\nintussusception, or abdominal perforation occurs and requires \\nemergent intervention. Gastrointestinal involvement is typically \\nseen during the acute phase of the illness. It may precede the \\nonset of rash.\\nOne third of children with HSP develop renal involvement, \\nwhich can be acute or chronic. Although renal involvement \\nis mild in most cases, acute glomerulonephritis manifested \\nby hematuria, hypertension, or acute renal failure can occur. \\nMost cases of glomerulonephritis occur within the first few \\nmonths of presentation, but rarely patients develop late renal \\ndisease, which ultimately can lead to chronic renal disease, \\nincluding renal failure.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and white \\nblood cell count are elevated in patients with HSP . The platelet \\ncount is the most important test, because HSP is characterized \\nby nonthrombocytopenic purpura with a normal, or even high, \\nplatelet count, differentiating HSP from other causes of purpura \\nthat are associated with thrombocytopenia such as autoimmune \\nthrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, or leukemia. \\nA urinalysis screens for evidence of hematuria.

A seasonal variability has been \\ndescribed with a peak between February and May, but the \\ndisease occurs throughout the year.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nThe clinical course of KD can be divided into three phases, \\neach with its own unique manifestations. Aneurysmal involve-\\nment of the coronary arteries is the most important manifesta-\\ntion of KD.\\nAcute Phase\\nTREATMENT\\nTherapy for HSP is supportive. A short-term course of non -\\nsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be administered for the \\nacute arthritis. Systemic corticosteroids usually are reserved \\nfor children with gastrointestinal disease and provide significant \\nrelief of abdominal pain. A typical dosing regimen is prednisone, \\n1 m g/kg/day for 1-2 weeks, followed by a taper schedule. \\nRecurrence of abdominal pain as corticosteroids are weaned \\nmay necessitate a longer course of treatment. Acute nephritis \\ntypically is treated with corticosteroids but may require more \\naggressive immunosuppressive therapy.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nMost cases of HSP are monophasic, lasting 3-4 weeks and \\nresolving completely. The rash can wax and wane, however, for \\n1 year after the initial episode of HSP . Parents should be warned \\nregarding possible recurrences. The arthritis of HSP does not \\nleave any permanent joint damage; it does not typically recur. \\nGastrointestinal involvement can lead to temporary abnormal \\nperistalsis that poses a risk of intussusception, which may be \\nfollowed by complete obstruction or infarction with bowel \\nperforation. Any child with a recent history of HSP who presents \\nwith acute abdominal pain, obstipation, or diarrhea should be \\nevaluated for intussusception. Renal involvement rarely may \\nlead to renal failure.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe prognosis of HSP is excellent. Most children have complete \\nresolution of the illness without any significant sequelae. HSP \\npatients with renal disease (elevated blood urea nitrogen, \\npersistent high-grade proteinuria) are at highest risk for long-\\nterm complications such as hypertension or renal insufficiency, \\nparticularly if the initial course was marked by significant \\nnephritis. There is a long-term risk of progression to end-stage \\nrenal disease in less than 1% of children with HSP . The rare \\npatients who develop end-stage renal disease may require renal \\ntransplantation. HSP may recur in the transplanted kidney.\\nCHAPTER 88 \\nKawasaki Disease\\nETIOLOGY\\nKawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitis of unknown etiology that \\nis characterized by multisystem involvement and inflammation \\nof small- to medium-sized arteries with resulting aneurysm \\nformation.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nKD is the second most common vasculitis of childhood.

The incidence in the \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLymphadenopathy\\nFever Without a Source\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nThe acute phase of KD, which lasts 1-2 weeks, is marked by \\nsudden onset of a high, hectic fever without an apparent source. \\nThe onset of fever is followed by conjunctival erythema; mucosal \\nchanges, including dry, cracked lips and a strawberry tongue; \\ncervical lymphadenopathy; and swelling of the hands and feet \\n(Fig. 88.1). Conjunctivitis is bilateral, bulbar, and nonsuppura-\\ntive. Cervical lymphadenopathy is found in 70% of children \\nand should be greater than 1.5 cm in di ameter for the purposes \\nof diagnosis. A rash, which can vary in appearance, occurs in \\n80% of children with KD and may be particularly accentuated \\nin the inguinal area and on the chest. Extreme irritability is \\nprominent, especially in infants. Abdominal pain and hydrops \\nof the gallbladder, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, sterile pyuria, \\nand arthritis, particularly of medium-sized to large joints, may \\noccur. Carditis in the acute phase may be manifested by \\ntachycardia, shortness of breath, or overt heart failure. Giant \\ncoronary artery aneurysms, which are rare but occur most \\ncommonly in very young children, can appear during this phase.\\nSubacute Phase\\nThe subacute phase, which lasts until about the 4th week, is \\ncharacterized by gradual resolution of fever (if untreated) and \\nother symptoms. Desquamation of the skin, particularly of \\nthe fingers and toes, appears at this point. The platelet count, \\npreviously normal or slightly depressed, increases to a significant \\ndegree (often >1 million/mm3). This phase heralds the onset \\nof coronary artery aneurysms, which may also appear in the \\nconvalescent phase and pose the highest risk of morbidity and \\nmortality.

Beau lines of the fingernails \\nmay appear during this phase.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nIt is particularly important to exclude other causes of fever, \\nnotably infection. It is appropriate to obtain blood and urine \\ncultures and to perform a chest x-ray. In the acute phase, \\ninflammatory parameters are elevated, including white blood \\ncell count, C-reactive protein, and the ESR, which can be \\nprofoundly elevated (often >80 mm/hr). P latelet counts may be \\ninappropriately low or normal. A lumbar puncture, if performed \\nto exclude infection, may reveal pleocytosis. Tests of hepatobili-\\nary function may be abnormal. Greatly elevated platelet counts \\ndevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary \\nartery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional \\nechocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2-3 weeks, \\nand again at 6-8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, \\npotentially, coronary angiography are indicated for patients \\nwho develop coronary artery abnormalities.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis of KD is based on the presence of fever for more \\nthan 5 days without an identifiable source and the presence of \\nfour of five other clinical criteria (Table 88.1).\\nThe diagnosis of incomplete (atypical) KD, which occurs \\nmore commonly in infants, is made when fever is present for at \\nleast 5 days, even if only two or three clinical criteria are present, \\nparticularly in the presence of coronary artery aneurysms. The \\ndiagnosis of KD should be considered in infants younger than \\n6 months of age with fever for at least 7 days even if no other \\ncriteria are present. Because many of the manifestations of KD \\nare found in other illnesses, many diagnoses must be considered \\nand excluded before the diagnosis of KD can be established \\n(Table 88.2).\\nTREATMENT\\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the mainstay of therapy \\nfor KD, although the mechanism of action is unknown. A single \\ndose of IVIG (2  g/kg o ver 12 hours) usually results in rapid \\ndefervescence and resolution of clinical illness in most patients \\nand, more important, reduces the incidence of coronary artery \\nTABLE 88.1 Criteria for Diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease\\nFever of >5 days’ duration associated with at least four* of the \\nfollowing five changes:\\nBilateral nonsuppurative conjunctivitis\\nOne or more changes of the mucous membranes of the upper \\nrespiratory tract, including pharyngeal injection, dry fissured lips, \\ninjected lips, and “strawberry” tongue\\nOne or more changes of the extremities, including peripheral \\nerythema, peripheral edema, periungual desquamation, and \\ngeneralized desquamation\\nPolymorphous rash, primarily truncal\\nPosterior cervical lymphadenopathy > 1.5 cm in diameter\\nDisease cannot be explained by some other known disease \\nprocess\\n*A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease can be made if fever and only three changes \\nare present in conjunction with coronary artery disease documented by two-\\ndimensional echocardiography or coronary angiography.\\nA\\n B\\nFIGURE 88.1  Facial features of Kawasaki disease with (A) morbilliform rash and nonsuppurative \\nconjunctivitis and (B) red, chapped lips. \\naneurysms.

The clas-\\nsification of JIA includes several other types of juvenile arthritis, \\nsuch as enthesitis-related arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, and \\npsoriatic arthritis. The etiology of this autoimmune disease is \\nunknown. The common underlying manifestation of this group \\nof illnesses is the presence of chronic synovitis, or inflammation \\nof the synovial lining of the joint. The synovium becomes \\nthickened and hypervascular with infiltration by lymphocytes, \\nwhich also can be found in the synovial fluid along with inflam-\\nmatory cytokines. The inflammation leads to production and \\nrelease of tissue proteases and collagenases. If left untreated, \\nthe inflammation can lead to tissue destruction, particularly \\nof the articular cartilage and, eventually, the underlying bony \\nstructures.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nJIA is the most common chronic rheumatological disease of \\nchildhood, with a prevalence of 1 :  1,000 c hildren. The disease \\nhas two peaks, one at 1-3 years and one at 8-12 years, but it \\ncan occur at any age.

Prolonged inflammation \\n(greater than 10 days) puts the patient at greater risk for \\ndeveloping coronary artery aneurysms.

The uveitis associated with JIA can be asymptomatic until \\nthe point of visual loss, making it the primary treatable cause \\nof blindness in children. It is crucial for children with JIA to \\nundergo regular ophthalmological screening with a slit-lamp \\nexamination to identify anterior chamber inflammation and \\nto initiate prompt treatment of any active disease.\\nOligoarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\\nOligoarticular JIA is defined as the presence of arthritis in \\nfewer than five joints within 6 months of diagnosis. This is the \\nmost common form of JIA, accounting for approximately 50% \\nof cases.\\nOligoarticular JIA presents in young children, with a peak at \\n1-3 years and another peak at 8-12 years. The arthritis is found \\nin medium-sized to large joints; the knee is the most common \\njoint involved, followed by the ankle and the wrist. It is unusual \\nfor small joints, such as the fingers or toes, to be involved, \\nalthough this may occur. Neck, jaw, and hip involvement are also \\nuncommon. Children with oligoarticular JIA may be otherwise \\nwell without any evidence of systemic inflammation (fever, \\nweight loss, or failure to thrive) or any laboratory evidence \\nof systemic inflammation (elevated white blood cell count or \\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate). A subset of these children later \\ndevelops polyarticular disease (called extended oligoarthritis).\\nPolyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\\nPolyarticular JIA describes children with arthritis in five or \\nmore joints within the first 6 months of diagnosis and accounts \\nfor about 40% of cases. Children with polyarticular JIA tend \\nto have symmetric arthritis, which can affect any joint but \\ntypically involves the small joints of the hands, feet, ankles, \\nwrists, and knees. The cervical spine can be involved, leading \\nto fusion of the spine over time. In contrast to oligoarticular \\nJIA, children with polyarticular disease can present with evidence \\nproliferation and localized growth disturbance.

Other important features of this group include the frequent \\npresence of HLA-B27 and the need for earlier treatment with \\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nMost children with oligoarticular JIA have no laboratory \\nabnormalities. Children with polyarticular and systemic disease \\ncommonly show elevated acute phase reactants and anemia of \\nchronic disease. In all pediatric patients with joint or bone \\npain, a complete blood count should be performed to exclude \\nleukemia, which also can present with limb pain (see Chapter \\n155). All patients with oligoarticular JIA should have an \\nantinuclear antibody test to help identify those at higher risk \\nfor uveitis. Older children and adolescents with polyarticular \\ndisease should have a rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody \\nperformed to identify children with early onset adult rheumatoid \\narthritis.\\nDiagnostic arthrocentesis may be necessary to exclude sup-\\npurative arthritis in children who present with acute onset of \\nmonarticular symptoms. The synovial fluid white blood cell \\ncount is typically less than 50,000 to 100,000/mm3 and should \\nbe predominantly lymphocytes, rather than neutrophils seen \\nwith suppurative arthritis. Gram stain, PCR, and culture should \\nbe negative (see Chapter 118).\\nThe most common radiological finding in the early stages \\nof JIA is a normal bone x-ray. Over time, periarticular \\nosteopenia, resulting from decreased mineralization, is most \\ncommonly found. Growth centers may be slow to develop, \\nwhereas there may be accelerated maturation of growth plates \\nor evidence of bony proliferation. Erosions of bony articular \\nsurfaces may be a late finding. If the cervical spine is involved, \\nfusion of C1-4 may occur, and atlantoaxial subluxation may be  \\ndemonstrable.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis of JIA is established by the presence of arthritis, \\nthe duration of the disease for at least 6 weeks, and exclusion \\nof other possible diagnoses. Although a presumptive diagnosis \\nof systemic JIA can be established for a child during the systemic \\nof systemic inflammation, including malaise, low-grade fever, \\ngrowth retardation, anemia of chronic disease, and elevated \\nmarkers of inflammation. Polyarticular JIA can present at any \\nage, although there is a peak in early childhood. There is a \\nsecond peak in adolescence, but these children differ by the \\npresence of a positive rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibody \\nand most likely represent a subgroup with true adult rheumatoid \\narthritis; the clinical course and prognosis are similar to the \\nadult entity.\\nSystemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\\nA small subgroup of patients (approximately 10%) with juvenile \\narthritis does not present with onset of arthritis but rather with \\npreceding systemic inflammation. This form of JIA, thought \\nto be an autoinflammatory disease, manifests with a typical \\nrecurring, spiking fever, usually once or twice per day, which \\ncan occur for several weeks to months. This is accompanied \\nby a rash, typically morbilliform and salmon-colored. The \\nrash may be evanescent and occur at times of high fever only. \\nRarely the rash can be urticarial in nature. Internal organ \\ninvolvement also occurs. Serositis, such as pleuritis and peri-\\ncarditis, occurs in 50% of children. Pericardial tamponade may \\nrarely occur. Hepatosplenomegaly occurs in 70% of children. \\nChildren with systemic JIA appear sick; they have significant \\nconstitutional symptoms, including malaise and failure to thrive. \\nLaboratory findings show the inflammation, with elevated \\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, white blood \\ncell count, and platelet counts and anemia. The arthritis of JIA \\nfollows the systemic inflammation by 6 weeks to 6 months. \\nThe arthritis is typically polyarticular in nature and can be \\nextensive and resistant to treatment, placing these children at \\nhighest risk for long-term disability.\\nSpondyloarthropathies\\nThe spondyloarthropathies describe a group of arthritides that \\ninclude inflammation of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac joints \\nand enthesitis, or inflammation of tendinous insertions. These \\ninclude juvenile ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and \\nthe arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease. This group of \\ndiseases can also present with peripheral arthritis and can be \\ninitially classified in other subgroups.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs \\n(NSAIDs) are the first choice in the treatment of JIA. Naproxen, \\nsulindac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and others have been used \\nsuccessfully. Systemic corticosteroid medications, such as \\nprednisone and prednisolone, should be avoided in all but the \\nmost extreme circumstances, such as for severe systemic JIA \\nwith internal organ involvement or for significant active arthritis \\nleading to the inability to ambulate. In this circumstance, the \\ncorticosteroids are used as bridging therapy until other medica-\\ntions take effect. For patients with a few isolated inflamed joints, \\nintraarticular corticosteroids may be helpful.\\nSecond-line medications, such as hydroxychloroquine and \\nsulfasalazine, have been used in patients whose arthritis is \\nnot completely controlled with NSAIDs alone. Methotrexate, \\ngiven either orally or subcutaneously, has become the drug \\nof choice for polyarticular and systemic JIA, which may not \\nrespond to baseline agents alone. Methotrexate can cause bone \\nmarrow suppression and hepatotoxicity; regular monitoring can \\nminimize these risks. Leflunomide, with a similar adverse effect \\nprofile to methotrexate, has also been used. Biologic agents that \\ninhibit TNFα and block the inflammatory cascade, including \\netanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab, are effective in \\nthe treatment of JIA and may be superior to methotrexate in \\nthe spondyloarthropathy group. The risks of these agents are \\ngreater, however, and include serious infection and, possibly, \\nincreased risk of malignancy. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 \\nreceptor antagonist, is very beneficial in the treatment of the \\nsystemic features of systemic JIA.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nComplications with JIA result primarily from the loss of function \\nof an involved joint secondary to contractures, bony fusion, \\nor loss of joint space. Physical and occupational therapies, \\nprofessionally and through home programs, are crucial to \\npreserve and maximize function. More serious complications \\nstem from associated uveitis; if left untreated, it can lead to \\nserious visual loss or blindness.\\nA very serious complication of sJIA, macrophage activation \\nsyndrome (MAS), has received increasing recognition. Occur-\\nring in more than 10% of sJIA patients, MAS can be seen in the \\ncontext of overwhelming inflammation, which leads to activation \\nof proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting \\nin overwhelming release of proinflammatory cytokines. The \\npatient develops high fevers, hepatosplenomegaly, neurological \\nabnormalities, and bleeding diathesis. Laboratory studies reveal \\npancytopenia, profoundly elevated ferritin, transaminases, \\nand triglycerides, as well as elevated soluble CD25. There is \\nevidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with low \\nfibrinogen, increased D-dimer, and abnormal blood smear. Bone \\nmarrow sampling may identify mature macrophages displaying \\nhemophagocytic activity. MAS can lead to multisystem organ \\nfailure. Even with early detection and aggressive treatment, \\nmortality rates for MAS approximate 8%.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe prognosis of JIA is excellent, with an overall 85% complete \\nremission rate. Children with oligoarticular JIA uniformly tend \\nphase, a definitive diagnosis is not possible until arthritis \\ndevelops. Children must be younger than 16 years of age at \\nthe time of onset of the disease; the diagnosis of JIA does not \\nchange when the child becomes an adult. Because there are so \\nmany other causes of arthritis, these disorders need to be \\nexcluded before providing a definitive diagnosis of JIA (Table \\n89.3). The acute arthritides can affect the same joints as JIA \\nbut have a shorter time course.\\nTABLE 89.3 Differential Diagnosis of Juvenile Arthritis\\nCONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES\\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\nJuvenile dermatomyositis\\nScleroderma with arthritis\\nINFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS\\nBacterial arthritis\\nViral arthritis\\nFungal arthritis\\nLyme disease\\nREACTIVE ARTHRITIS\\nPoststreptococcal arthritis\\nRheumatic fever\\nToxic synovitis\\nHenoch-Schönlein purpura\\nReiter syndrome\\nORTHOPEDIC DISORDERS\\nTraumatic arthritis\\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease\\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis\\nOsteochondritis dissecans\\nChondromalacia patellae\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN SYNDROMES\\nGrowing pains\\nHypermobility syndromes\\nMyofascial pain syndromes/fibromyalgia\\nComplex regional pain syndrome\\nHEMATOLOGICAL/ONCOLOGICAL DISORDERS\\nLeukemia\\nLymphoma\\nSickle cell disease\\nThalassemia\\nMalignant and benign tumors of bone, cartilage, or synovium\\nMetastatic bone disease\\nHemophilia\\nMISCELLANEOUS\\nRickets/metabolic bone disease\\nLysosomal storage diseases\\nHeritable disorders of collagen\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

This antibody produc-\\ntion may be due to loss of T-lymphocyte control on B-lymphocyte \\nactivity, leading to hyperactivity of B lymphocytes, which leads \\nto nonspecific and specific antibody and autoantibody produc-\\ntion. These antibodies form immune complexes that become \\ntrapped in the microvasculature, leading to inflammation and \\nischemia.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAlthough SLE affects primarily women ages 20-40, approximately \\n5% of cases present in childhood, mainly around puberty. SLE \\nis rare in children younger than 9 years of age. Although there \\nis a female predominance of this disease in adolescence and \\nadulthood, there is an equal gender distribution in children. \\nThe overall prevalence of SLE in the pediatric population is \\n10-25 cases per 100,000 children.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nPatients with SLE can present either in an abrupt fashion with \\nfulminant disease or in an indolent manner (Tables 90.1 and \\n90.2). Nonspecific symptoms are common but can be quite \\nprofound and may include significant fatigue and malaise, \\nlow-grade fever, and weight loss.\\nSkin disease can be a prominent finding, occurring in up \\nto 95% of patients. A raised, erythematous rash on the cheeks, \\ncalled a malar butterfly rash, is common (Fig. 90.1). This rash can \\nalso occur across the bridge of the nose, on the forehead, and \\non the chin. Photosensitivity can be problematic, particularly \\nduring the summer months. Both of these rashes improve with \\nappropriate therapy. The rash of discoid lupus, by contrast, is \\nan inflammatory process that leads to disruption of the dermal-\\nepidermal junction, resulting in permanent scarring and loss \\nof pigmentation in the affected area. If discoid lupus occurs \\nin the scalp, permanent alopecia ensues because of loss of hair \\nfollicles. Alopecia and Raynaud phenomenon occurs, although \\nnot specific for SLE, and livedo reticularis also can occur.\\nMouth and nasal sores resulting from mucosal ulceration \\nare a common complaint in patients with SLE and can lead \\nto ulceration and perforation of the nasal septum.

Adult patients with SLE develop accelerated ath-\\nerosclerosis, not only because of prolonged corticosteroid use \\nbut also due to the underlying disease. All patients with SLE \\nshould be counseled regarding their weight and maintaining \\nan active lifestyle to reduce other cardiac risk factors.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nOutcomes for SLE have improved significantly over the past \\nseveral decades and depend largely on the organ systems that \\nare involved. Worse prognoses are seen in patients with severe \\nlupus nephritis or cerebritis, with risk of chronic disability or \\nprogression to renal failure. With current therapy for the disease \\nand the success of renal transplantation, however, most patients \\nlive well into adulthood.\\nCHAPTER 91 \\nJuvenile Dermatomyositis\\nETIOLOGY\\nThe etiology of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is unknown. \\nIt is characterized by the activation of T and B lymphocytes, \\nleading to vasculitis affecting small vessels of skeletal muscle, \\nwith immune complex deposition and subsequent inflammation \\nof blood vessels and muscle and inflammation of the skin. JDM \\nmay follow infections, allergic reactions, or sun exposure, but \\nno causal relationship has been shown.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nJDM is a rare disease, with an incidence of less than 0.1 : 1 00,000 \\nchildren. JDM can occur in all age groups with a peak incidence \\nbetween 4 and 10 years. The disease is slightly more common \\nin girls than boys.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nDermatomyositis tends to present in a slow, progressive fashion, \\nwith insidious onset of fatigue, malaise, and progressive muscle \\nweakness, accompanied by low-grade fevers and rash. Some \\nchildren present in an acute fashion, however, with rapid onset \\nof severe disease.\\nThe muscle disease of JDM primarily affects the proximal \\nmuscles, particularly the hip and shoulder girdles, and the \\nabdominal and neck muscles. Children have difficulty climbing \\nsteps, getting out of chairs, and getting off the floor. The patient \\nmay have a positive Gower sign. In severe cases, the patient is \\nnot able to sit up from a supine position or even lift the head \\noff the examination table (see Chapter 182). If muscles of the \\nupper airway and pharynx are involved, the patient’s voice will \\nsound nasal and the patient may have difficulty swallowing.\\nA classic JDM rash occurs on the face and across the cheeks \\nbut also can be found on the shoulders and back (shawl sign). \\nPatients may have heliotrope discoloration of the eyelids. Scaly, \\nproduction can lead to polyclonal hypergammopathy, with an \\nelevated globulin fraction in the serum. Excessive circulating \\nantibodies and immune complexes also lead to the consumption \\nof complement proteins, with low levels of C3 and C4 and \\ndecreased complement function as measured by CH50. Effective \\ntherapy returns the low complement levels to normal. This is \\none way to monitor therapy, except in patients with familial \\ndeficiency in complement components, which itself predisposes  \\nto SLE.\\nUrinalysis may show hematuria and proteinuria, identify -\\ning patients with lupus nephritis. Serum blood urea nitrogen \\nand creatinine evaluate renal function. Hypoalbuminemia \\nand hypoproteinemia may be present due to leakage at the \\nglomerular level. Elevation of muscle enzymes may be a clue \\nfor the presence of myositis. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \\nprotein and an elevated IgG-to-albumin ratio when comparing \\nCSF with serum (IgG index) can indicate antibody production \\nin the CSF and help diagnose SLE affecting the CNS. CNS \\nlupus has a specific pattern on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic \\nresonance imaging.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nBecause SLE is a multisystem disease, it can be difficult to \\ndiagnose early in the disease course. Suspicion must be high \\nin patients who present with diffuse symptoms, particularly \\nadolescent girls. Many of the clinical manifestations of SLE are \\nfound in other inflammatory illnesses and during acute or \\nchronic infection. Criteria have been developed for the diagnosis \\nof SLE (see Table 90.1). The presence of 4 of 11 of these criteria \\nhas 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity for SLE.\\nTREATMENT\\nCorticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for SLE \\nfor decades. Initial use of pulse methylprednisolone and high-\\ndose oral prednisone (up to 2  m g/kg) frequently is required, \\nfollowed by cautious tapering to minimize recurrence of \\nsymptoms. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have been \\nused to treat the arthralgias and arthritis associated with SLE. \\nHydroxychloroquine is used not only for the treatment of lupus \\nskin disease, such as discoid lupus, but as maintenance therapy. \\nHydroxychloroquine treatment results in longer periods of \\nwellness between flares of disease as well as decreased numbers \\nof flares.\\nCorticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine frequently are not \\nsufficient therapies for lupus nephritis or cerebritis. Cyclophos-\\nphamide is effective for the worst forms of lupus nephritis, with \\nsignificant improvements in outcome and decreased rates of \\nprogression to renal failure. Mycophenolate mofetil may also \\nhave a role in the treatment of lupus nephritis. CNS lupus \\nresponds to cyclophosphamide. For patients who are not able to \\ntolerate the tapering of corticosteroids, the use of steroid-sparing \\nagents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate \\nmofetil, may be indicated.\\nPatients with SLE should be counseled to wear sun block and \\navoid sun exposure because exposure to the sun precipitates \\nflares of the disease. Because of this prohibition, patients benefit \\nfrom calcium and vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk \\nof osteoporosis that may result from prolonged corticosteroid \\nuse. Early treatment of hyperlipidemia to decrease long-term \\ncardiovascular complications is also indicated.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Patients should be advised to wear \\nsun block and refrain from prolonged sun exposure. Accordingly \\nsupplementation with calcium and active forms of vitamin D \\nis also indicated.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nThe most serious complication of JDM is the development of \\ncalcinosis. Dystrophic calcification can occur in the skin and \\nsoft tissues in any area of the body; it ranges from mild to \\nextensive (calcinosis universalis). Although it is difficult to \\npredict who will develop calcinosis, it occurs more commonly \\nin children with cutaneous vasculitis, prolonged disease activity, \\nor delays in onset of therapy. Patients with JDM who develop \\nvasculitis also are at risk for gastrointestinal perforation and \\ngastrointestinal bleeding. JDM has been associated with \\nlipoatrophy and insulin resistance, which can progress to type \\n2 diabetes. Control of insulin resistance frequently leads to \\nimprovement in muscle disease in these patients.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe outcome of JDM depends greatly on the extent of muscle \\ndisease and the time between disease onset and initiation of \\ntherapy. JDM follows one of three clinical courses: a monophasic \\ncourse, in which patients are treated and improve without \\nsignificant sequelae; a chronic recurrent course; and a chronic \\nprogressive course marked by poor response to therapy and \\nresulting loss of function. Patients who ultimately develop \\ncalcinosis are at risk for chronic loss of mobility, depending \\non the extent of calcium deposition. The association of der-\\nmatomyositis with malignancy seen in adults does not occur \\nin children.\\nCHAPTER 92 \\nMusculoskeletal Pain \\nSyndromes\\nGROWING PAINS\\nGrowing pains, or benign musculoskeletal pain syndrome, \\noccur in 10-20% of school-age children. The peak age range is \\n3-7 years; the syndrome seems to be more common in boys \\nthan girls. There is no known etiology, although there seems \\nto be a familial predisposition.\\nChildren with growing pains complain of deep, crampy \\npain in the calves and thighs. It most typically occurs in the \\nevening or as nocturnal pain that occasionally can awaken \\nthe child from sleep. Growing pains tend to be more common \\nin children who are extremely active; bouts are exacerbated \\nby increased physical activity. The physical examination is \\nunremarkable, with no evidence of arthritis or muscular tender-\\nness or weakness. Laboratory studies or x-rays, if performed,  \\nare normal.\\nThe diagnosis of growing pains is based on a typical history \\nand a normal physical examination. Hypermobility excludes \\nred plaques (Gottron papules) classically are found across the \\nknuckles but can be found on the extensor surfaces of any \\njoint. Patients may have periungual erythema and dilated nail-\\nfold capillaries. Less commonly, patients develop cutaneous \\nvasculitis, with inflammation, erythema, and skin breakdown.\\nAt some point, approximately 15% of patients with JDM \\ndevelop arthritis that commonly affects small joints but may \\ninvolve any joint. Raynaud phenomenon, hepatomegaly, and \\nsplenomegaly may also occur.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nMany patients with JDM have no evidence of systemic inflam-\\nmation (normal blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation \\nrate). Evidence of myositis can be identified in 98% of children \\nwith active JDM by elevated serum muscle enzymes, including \\naspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine \\nphosphokinase, aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Electro-\\nmyography and muscle biopsy can document the myositis. \\nMagnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of showing \\nmuscle inflammation.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDiagnosis of JDM is based on the presence of documented \\nmuscle inflammation in the setting of classic rash (Table 91.1). \\nA small percentage of children have muscle disease without \\nskin manifestations, but polymyositis is sufficiently rare in \\nchildren that they should have a muscle biopsy to exclude other \\ncauses of muscle weakness, such as muscular dystrophy (par-\\nticularly in boys). The differential diagnosis also includes \\npostinfectious myositis and other myopathies (see Chapter 182).\\nTREATMENT\\nMethotrexate, supplemented by short-term use of systemic \\ncorticosteroids, is the cornerstone of therapy for JDM. Initial \\ntreatment with pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is followed \\nby several months of tapering doses of oral prednisone. Early \\ninstitution of methotrexate significantly decreases the duration \\nof corticosteroid use and its associated toxicities. Intravenous \\nimmunoglobulin is useful as adjunctive therapy.

These disorders most commonly present in children \\n3-10 years of age. Girls are more commonly affected than boys. \\nThere is a familial predisposition to hypermobility syndromes. \\nSpecific diseases causing hypermobility include Marfan syn -\\ndrome, homocystinuria, Stickler syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos \\nsyndromes, osteogenesis imperfecta, Williams syndrome, and \\ntrisomy 21. Most children with hypermobility do not have an \\nidentifiable associated syndrome or disease.\\nHypermobility can be isolated to a specific joint group or can \\npresent as a generalized disorder. Symptoms vary depending \\non the joints involved. The most consistent symptom is pain, \\nwhich may occur during the day or night. The discomfort may \\nincrease after exertion but rarely interferes with regular physical \\nactivity. Children with hypermobility of the ankles or feet may \\ncomplain of chronic leg or back pain.\\nJoint hypermobility may be quite marked. Range of motion \\nmay be exaggerated with excessive flexion or extension at the \\nmetacarpophalangeal joints, wrists, elbows, or knees (genu \\nrecurvatum; Fig. 92.1). There may be excessive pronation of \\nthe ankles. Hypermobility of the foot (flat foot; pes planus) is \\nshown by the presence of a longitudinal arch of the foot that \\ndisappears with weight bearing and may be associated with a \\nshortened Achilles tendon (see Chapter 200). These findings are \\nrarely associated with tenderness on examination. No laboratory \\ntest abnormalities are apparent, and radiographs of affected \\njoints are normal.\\nThe diagnosis of isolated hypermobility is made on the basis \\nof physical examination with demonstration of exaggerated \\nmobility of a joint. Generalized hypermobility is diagnosed by \\nthe presence of sufficient criteria (Table 92.1) and the absence \\nof evidence of other underlying disorders. Excessive skin \\nelasticity, easy bruisability, or mitral valve prolapse suggests \\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome rather than \\nbenign hypermobility.\\nThe treatment of hypermobility consists of reassurance \\nand regular stretching, similar to treatment for other benign \\nmusculoskeletal disorders. NSAIDs can be administered as \\nneeded but do not need to be prescribed on a regular basis. \\nArch supports can be helpful in children with symptomatic \\npes planus but are not indicated in the absence of symptoms. \\nBenign hypermobility tends to improve with increasing age \\nand is not associated with long-term complications.\\nFIGURE 92.1  Hyperextension of the knees―an example of \\nhypermobility. \\nTABLE 92.1 Criteria for Hypermobility\\nMODIFIED CRITERIA OF CARTER AND WILKINSON\\nThree of Five Are Required to Establish a Diagnosis of Hypermobility:\\n•\\t Touch\\tthumb \\tto \\tvolar \\tforearm\\n•\\t Hyperextend\\tmetacarpophalangeal \\tjoints \\tso \\tfingers \\tparallel \\t\\nforearm\\n•\\t >10° hyperextension of elbows\\n•\\t >10° hyperextension of knees\\n•\\t Touch\\tpalms \\tto \\tfloor \\twith \\tknees \\tstraight\\nBeighton Scale\\n•\\t ≥6 points defines hypermobility: touch thumb to volar forearm \\n(one point each for right and left)\\n•\\t Extend\\tfifth \\tmetacarpophalangeal \\tjoint \\tto \\t90° \\t(one \\tpoint \\teach \\t\\nfor right and left)\\n•\\t >10° hyperextension of elbow (one point each for right and \\nleft)\\n•\\t >10° hyperextension of knee (one point each for right and left)\\n•\\t Touch\\tpalms \\tto \\tfloor \\twith \\tknees \\tstraight \\t(one \\tpoint)\\nOther Noncriteria Features of Many Children With Hypermobility:\\n•\\t Put\\theel \\tbehind \\thead\\n•\\t Excessive\\tinternal \\trotation \\tto \\thip\\n•\\t Excessive\\tankle \\tdorsiflexion\\n•\\t Excessive\\teversion \\tof \\tthe \\tfoot\\n•\\t Passively\\ttouch \\telbows \\tbehind \\tthe \\tback\\nData from Carter C, Wilkins J.

The etiology of these disorders is unknown, \\nalthough there seems to be a familial predisposition. Although \\nthese disorders sometimes follow viral infection or trauma, no \\ncausal relationship has been shown. The myofascial pain \\nsyndromes are most common in adults but can occur in children \\n(particularly >12 years of age). The syndromes are more common \\nin girls than in boys. The prevalence of fibromyalgia in children \\nhas been reported to be 6%.\\nPatients with myofascial pain syndromes complain of long-\\nstanding diffuse pain in muscles and in the soft tissues around \\njoints that can occur at any time of day, awaken the patient from \\nsleep, and interfere with regular activities. There is frequently a \\nhigh degree of school absenteeism, despite maintaining adequate \\nschool performance. A significant percentage of patients with \\nmyofascial pain syndromes exhibit symptoms consistent with \\ndepression. An increased incidence of sexual abuse has been \\nreported in children presenting with fibromyalgia.\\nPhysical examination is typically unremarkable with the \\nexception of the presence of specific points that are painful—not \\njust tender—to digital palpation. These points often are located \\non the neck, back, lateral epicondyles, greater trochanter, and \\nknees. There is no evidence of arthritis or muscular weakness.\\nPatients with myofascial pain syndromes frequently undergo \\nextensive medical testing because of the concern for underlying \\ninflammatory disease. These tests are invariably normal. Children \\nmay have a false-positive antinuclear antibody, which is found \\nin 20% of the normal pediatric population.\\nThe diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome is based on \\nthe presence of multiple tender points in the absence of other \\nillness. To fulfill strict criteria for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, \\nthe patient must have a history of diffuse pain for at least 3 \\nmonths and the presence of multiple pain sites and an elevated \\nsymptom profile as measured by formal instruments.

The \\nhallmark of HSP is nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura, \\nwhich predominantly occurs on the buttocks and lower \\nextremities. Other features of HSP include arthritis, \\ngastrointestinal, and renal involvement.\\n• The differential diagnosis includes other vasculitis syndromes, \\nleukemia, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\\n• Treatment of HSP is largely supportive; nonsteroidal anti -\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used for arthritis. In rare \\ncases, such as gastrointestinal (GI) involvement or active \\nnephritis, steroids are used.\\n• The prognosis of HSP is excellent. Most cases of HSP are \\nuniphasic and resolve within 3-4 weeks, but the GI symptoms \\ncan recur as steroids are weaned, and the rash of HSP can \\nrecur for 12-15 months. In rare cases, patients can develop \\nchronic renal disease.\\n• Immunoglobulin (Ig)A is often present in skin and renal \\nlesions.\\nCHAPTER 88\\nKawasaki Disease\\n• Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that typically affects children \\nunder the age of seven and runs a triphasic course: acute, \\nsubacute, and convalescent. The acute phase, which lasts \\n1-2 weeks, is characterized by a high, hectic fever, followed \\nby conjunctival erythema, mucosal changes, cervical lymph-\\nadenopathy, swelling of the hands and feet, and elevated \\ninflammatory parameters. The subacute phase is noted by \\ndesquamation of the skin, reactive thrombocytosis, and \\ndevelopment of coronary artery aneurysms. The convalescent \\nphase, which occurs 6-8 weeks into the illness, is character-\\nized by the resolution of symptoms and development of \\ndystrophic nail changes.\\n• The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is made based on the \\npresence of fever for more than 5 days without an identifiable \\nsource and the presence of four of five other clinical criteria: \\nbilateral nonsuppurative conjunctivitis, mucosal changes, \\nextremity changes, polymorphous rash, and posterior cervical \\nlymphadenopathy greater than 1.5 cm in diameter.\\n• The most serious complication of Kawasaki disease is coro-\\nnary artery aneurysms. The main treatment of Kawasaki \\ndisease is intravenous Ig, which has been shown to reduce \\nthe incidence of coronary artery aneurysms from 20-25% \\nto <5%.\\nCHAPTER 89\\nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\\n• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common \\nrheumatological disease of childhood and is classified into \\nsubtypes including oligoarticular, polyarticular, systemic, \\njuvenile psoriatic arthritis, and spondyloarthropathies.\\n• Chronic arthritis is characterized by gradual onset, morning \\nstiffness and joint pain, swelling, erythema, and limitation \\nof range of motion, either from pain or contracture. Due \\nto the presence of active growth plates, patients also develop \\nlocalized growth disturbance, which causes the ends of the \\nsurrounding bones to be longer and wider.\\n• Systemic JIA differs from the other subtypes of arthritis, as \\nthe presence of arthritis is preceded by a systemic inflam -\\nmatory process characterized by high diurnal fever, rash, \\nhepatosplenomegaly, and elevated inflammatory parameters.\\n• The treatment of JIA consists in controlling the inflammation \\nand preserving joint function. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory \\nmedications are considered first line of therapy, followed \\nby methotrexate and then biologic agents. Steroids are used \\nsparingly as bridge therapy and are not used for maintenance \\ntherapy. Prognosis of JIA overall is excellent with an overall \\n85% complete remission rate. Higher rates of remission are \\nseen in the oligoarticular group and are lowest in the systemic \\nand polyarticular groups.\\n• The most common complication of JIA is uveitis. The uveitis \\nis frequently asymptomatic until the point of visual loss and \\ntherefore requires regular screening with a slit-lamp exam. \\nAll children with JIA are at increased risk for uveitis, but \\nthose with a positive antinuclear antibody are at even higher \\nrisk and need to be screened more often.\\n• The most severe complication of JIA is macrophage activation \\nsyndrome (MAS), which can occur in systemic JIA. MAS \\nis caused by massive release of cytokines in the context of \\noverwhelming inflammation leading to pancytopenia, liver \\ndysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and \\nmultiorgan failure. Even with appropriate treatment, mortality \\nrates from MAS are approximately 8%.\\nCHAPTER 90\\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disease \\ncharacterized by large amounts of circulating antibodies, \\nboth nonspecific and specific autoantibodies, which form \\nan immune complex that becomes trapped in the micro -\\nvasculature, leading to inflammation and ischemia.\\n• The most serious features of systemic lupus erythematosus \\n(SLE) are nephritis and central nervous system (CNS) \\ninvolvement, which can lead to long-term morbidity. Other \\nfeatures include malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, \\nmucosal ulceration, arthritis, myositis, and hemolytic anemia. \\nBecause the features are nonspecific, diagnosis is made based \\non specific criteria, including the presence of specific \\nautoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody and anti-double-\\nstranded DNA antibody.\\n• Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for \\nSLE. For more aggressive disease, such as renal or CNS \\ndisease, medications like cyclophosphamide may be used. \\nIn patients for which steroids cannot be reduced, steroid-\\nsparing agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, \\nor azathioprine may be used.\\n• Long-term outcomes in SLE have improved significantly \\nand are determined primarily by the presence or absence \\nof nephritis or neurological involvement, with most patients \\nliving well into adulthood.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Kronman | Cla udia S. Crowell | Su rabhi B. Vora\\nCHAPTER 93 \\nInfectious Disease Assessment\\nOverlapping clinical symptoms caused by infectious and \\nnoninfectious illnesses make the diagnosis of some diseases \\ndifficult. Clinicians are concerned that an untreated minor \\ninfection may progress to a life-threatening illness, if appropriate \\ntreatment is not given. However, unnecessary treatment with \\nantimicrobial agents may lead to emergence of antimicrobial-\\nresistant organisms, in addition to antibiotic-associated diarrhea \\nor allergic reactions. Therefore accurate diagnosis of infectious \\nand noninfectious diseases is critical to ensure the provision \\nof specific treatment only as indicated, and thereby reduce the \\nunnecessary use of antibiotics.\\nA thorough patient assessment, including a detailed history, \\ncomplete physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic \\ntesting, is the cornerstone of optimal care.\\nINITIAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION\\nThe ability to diagnose specific infections accurately begins \\nwith an understanding of the epidemiology; risk factors, includ-\\ning exposures to sick contacts or environmental risks (e.g., \\ntravel, zoonoses); and infection susceptibility related either to \\nage (reflecting the maturity of the immune system) or to primary \\nor secondary immunodeficiencies. Obtaining a thorough history \\nand physical examination identifies most of these elements \\n(Tables 93.1 and 93.2) and guides the appropriate use of other \\ndiagnostic tests.\\nUnique questions that help identify whether an infection is \\ncausing the patient’s symptoms include a detailed environmental \\nhistory (including sick contacts, travel, food, water, and animal \\nexposure; see Table 93.1). Certain infections are more common \\nin specific geographic areas. For instance, parasitic infections \\nare more common in tropical climates. Certain fungal infections \\nhave specific geographic distribution (coccidioidomycosis in the \\nsouthwestern United States, blastomycosis in the upper Midwest, \\nand histoplasmosis in central United States). In other areas, \\nfungal pneumonias are rare except in immunocompromised \\npersons.\\nAn immunization history is critical for determining suscepti-\\nbility to vaccine preventable diseases. Family history, especially \\nthat of unexpected deaths of male infants, may suggest familial \\nimmunodeficiency (see Chapters 73 through 76). Localization \\nof symptoms to a specific body site may narrow diagnostic \\npossibilities (see Table 93.2).\\nA complete physical examination is essential to identify signs \\nof infection, which may be systemic (e.g., fever and shock) or \\nfocal (e.g., swelling, erythema, tenderness, and limitation of func-\\ntion). Many infectious diseases are associated with characteristic \\ncutaneous signs (see Table 97.1). Accurate otolaryngological \\nexamination is critical for diagnosing upper respiratory tract \\ninfections and otitis media, the most common childhood \\ninfectious diseases in the United States.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFever and Rash\\nFever Without a Source\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nFever does not always represent infection. Rheumatological \\ndiseases, inflammatory bowel disease, Kawasaki disease, poison-\\ning, periodic fever syndromes, and malignancy also may present \\nwith fever. Particularly, children with overwhelming infection \\nmay be afebrile or hypothermic. Common symptoms, such as \\nbone pain or lymphadenopathy that suggest infection, may \\nalso be due to leukemia, lymphoma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, \\nor Kawasaki disease (see Chapters 88, 89, and 153). Acute mental \\nstatus changes or focal neurological impairment could be \\nmanifestations of infections (encephalitis, meningitis, or brain \\nabscess) or noninfectious causes (brain or spinal tumors, \\ninflammatory conditions, postinfectious sequelae, or impairment \\nfrom toxic ingestions or inhalants). Many manifestations of \\nmucosal allergy (rhinitis, diarrhea) may mimic common infec-\\ntious diseases (see Chapter 77).\\nSome infections are prone to recurrence, especially if treat-\\nment is suboptimal (inadequate antimicrobial or insufficient \\nduration). Recurrent, severe, or unusual (opportunistic) infec-\\ntions suggest the possibility of immunodeficiency (see Chapters \\n72 and 125).\\nSCREENING TESTS\\nLaboratory diagnosis of infection includes examination of \\nbacterial morphology using Gram stain, various culture tech-\\nniques, molecular microbiologic methods (e.g., polymerase \\nchain reaction or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization \\ntime of flight), and assessment of the immune response with \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Atypical lymphocytes are mature \\nT lymphocytes with larger, eccentrically placed, and indented \\nnuclei classically seen with infectious mononucleosis caused \\nby Epstein-Barr virus. Other infections associated with atypical \\nlymphocytosis include cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, \\nviral hepatitis, rubella, roseola, mumps, and some drug reactions. \\nEosinophilia is characteristic of allergic diseases but may be seen \\nwith tissue-invasive multicellular parasites, such as the migration \\nof the larval stages of parasites through skin, connective tissue, \\nand viscera. High-grade eosinophilia (>30% eosinophils, or a \\ntotal eosinophil count >3,000/µL) frequently occurs during the \\nmuscle invasion phase of trichinellosis, the pulmonary phases of \\nascariasis and hookworm infection (eosinophilic pneumonia), \\nand the hepatic and central nervous system phases of visceral \\nlarva migrans.\\nOther common screening tests include urinalysis for urinary \\ntract infections, transaminases for liver inflammation, and \\nlumbar puncture for evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid if \\nthere is concern for meningitis or encephalitis (see Chapters \\n100 and 101). Various tests may help distinguish viral versus \\nbacterial infection, but definitive diagnosis requires identifying \\nthe agent by culture or molecular means.\\nCultures are the mainstay of diagnosis of many infections. \\nBlood cultures are sensitive and specific for bacteremia, which \\nmay be primary or secondary to a focal infection (osteomyelitis, \\ngastroenteritis, pyelonephritis, and endocarditis). Urine cultures \\nare important to confirm urinary tract infection, which may be \\noccult in young infants. Cultures should be obtained with every \\nlumbar puncture, aspiration, or biopsy of other fluid collections \\nor masses. Specific types of cultures (bacterial, fungal, viral, \\nor mycobacterial) are guided by the clinical problem. Tissue \\nculture techniques are used to identify viruses and intracellular \\nbacterial pathogens.\\nAntibiotics often are begun before a definitive diagnosis \\nis established, complicating the ability to rely on subsequent \\ncultures for microbiologic diagnosis (see Chapter 95). Although \\npersistent or progressive symptoms, despite antibiotic treatment, \\nmay indicate the need to change the regimen, more frequently \\nthis indicates the need to stop all antibiotics to facilitate definitive \\ndiagnosis by obtaining appropriate cultures. Antibiotics should \\nnot be given before obtaining appropriate cultures unless there \\nis a life-threatening situation (e.g., septic shock).\\nRapid tests, such as antigen tests, are useful for preliminary \\ndiagnosis and are available for numerous bacterial, viral, fungal, \\nand parasitic infections. Serological tests, using enzyme-linked \\nimmunosorbent assay or Western blotting, showing an immu-\\nnoglobulin (Ig)M response, high IgG titer, or seroconversion \\nbetween acute and convalescent sera, also can be used for \\ndiagnosis. Molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction \\n(nucleic acid amplification tests) for DNA or RNA, offer the \\nspecificity of culture, high sensitivity, and rapid results. When \\nan unusual infection is suspected, a microbiologist should be \\nconsulted before samples are obtained.\\nDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING\\nThe choice of diagnostic imaging modality should be based \\non the location of the findings and the differential diagno-\\nsis. In the absence of localizing signs, and during an acute \\ninfection, imaging of the entire body is less productive. Plain \\nx-rays are useful initial tests for respiratory tract infections. \\nantibody titers or skin testing. The acute phase response is a \\nnonspecific metabolic and inflammatory response to infection, \\ntrauma, autoimmune disease, and some malignancies. Acute \\nphase reactants, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, \\nC-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, are commonly elevated \\nduring an infection but are not specific for infection and do \\nnot identify any specific infection. These tests can be used to \\nmonitor response to therapy.\\nA complete blood count  is frequently obtained for evi -\\ndence of infection. The initial response to infection, especially \\nin children, is usually a leukocytosis (increased number of \\ncirculating leukocytes) with an initial neutrophilic response \\nto both bacterial and viral infections. With most viral infec-\\ntions, this response is transient and is followed quickly by \\na characteristic mononuclear response. In general, bacterial \\ninfections are associated with greater neutrophil counts than \\nviral infections (Table 93.3). A left-shift is an increase in the \\nnumbers of circulating immature cells of the neutrophil series, \\nincluding band forms, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes. It \\nindicates the rapid release of cells from the bone marrow and \\nis characteristic of both the early stages of infection and, if \\nsustained, bacterial infections.

A voiding cystourethrogram may be \\nused to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux, a predisposing factor \\nfor upper urinary tract infections. Radionuclide scans, such \\nas technetium-99m for osteomyelitis and dimercaptosuccinic \\nacid for acute pyelonephritis, are often informative.\\nCHAPTER 94 \\nImmunization and Prophylaxis\\nIMMUNIZATION\\nChildhood immunization has markedly reduced the impact of \\nmajor infectious diseases. Active immunization induces \\nimmunity through the administration of all or part of a \\nmicroorganism or a modified product of a microorganism (e.g., \\ntoxoid). Passive immunization involves administration of \\nprotective antibodies and includes transplacental transfer of \\nmaternal antibodies and the administration of preformed \\nantibody, either as immunoglobulin or as monoclonal \\nantibody.\\nVaccinations may be with live-attenuated viruses (measles, \\nmumps, rubella [MMR], varicella, nasal influenza, oral polio), \\nUltrasonography is a noninvasive, nonirradiating technique \\nwell suited to infants and children for imaging solid organs. It \\nalso is useful to identify soft tissue abscesses with lymphadenitis \\nand to diagnose suppurative arthritis of the hip.

The ACIP recommends that children in the United \\nStates routinely receive vaccines against 16 diseases (see Fig. \\n94.1). This schedule includes up to 23 injections in four to five \\nvisits by 18 months of age. Children who are at increased risk \\nfor pneumococcal infections should receive the pneumococcal \\npolysaccharide vaccine as well. Infants and children who are \\nat increased risk for meningococcal infections should receive \\nthe two- or four-dose meningococcal series depending on \\nage. Children who are behind in immunization should receive \\ncatch-up immunizations as rapidly as feasible. Infants born \\nprematurely, regardless of birth weight, should be vaccinated at \\nthe same chronological age and according to the same schedule \\nas full-term infants and children (see Fig. 94.2). The single \\nexception to this practice is providing hepatitis B vaccine at \\n1 month of age instead of at birth for infants weighing less \\nthan 2,000 g if t he mother is hepatitis B virus surface antigen \\n(HBsAg)-negative. Vaccines for adolescents should be given at \\ninactivated or killed viruses (intramuscular polio, hepatitis A, \\nintramuscular influenza), recombinant products (hepatitis \\nB, human papillomavirus), live reassortants (rotavirus), or \\nimmunogenic components of bacteria (pertussis, Haemophilus \\ninfluenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus \\npneumoniae), including toxoids (diphtheria, tetanus). Many \\npurified polysaccharides are T-cell independent antigens that \\ninitiate B-cell proliferation without involvement of CD4 T \\nlymphocytes and are poor immunogens in children younger \\nthan 2 years of age. Conjugation of a polysaccharide to a protein \\ncarrier induces a T-cell dependent response in infants and \\ncreates immunogenic vaccines for H. influenzae type b, S. \\npneumoniae, and N. meningitidis.\\nChildhood immunization standards and recommendations \\nin the United States (Figs. 94.1 and 94.2) are formulated by the \\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (ACIP), the American \\nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family \\nPhysicians.

Prophylaxis should be \\nadministered if the animal is rabid or suspected to be rabid, \\nor if the animal develops signs of rabies while under observation. \\nA captured wild animal should be euthanized (by animal control \\nofficials) without a period of observation and its brain examined \\nfor evidence of rabies. If the biting animal is not captured, \\nparticularly if it is a wild animal of a species known to harbor \\nthe virus in the region, rabies should be presumed and pro-\\nphylaxis administered to the victim. Bats, raccoons, skunks, \\nfoxes, coyotes, and bobcats are the most important wild animal \\npotential sources of rabies infection. Prophylaxis also should \\nbe provided following exposure to a bat for persons who might \\nbe unaware or unable to relate that a bite or direct contact has \\noccurred, such as a mentally disabled person, a sleeping child, \\nor an unattended infant. Local public health departments are \\nimportant resources for determining rabies risk based on local \\nepidemiology.\\nAll rabies postexposure management begins with immediate \\nthorough cleansing of the bite using soap and water. RIG at a \\ndose of 20  IU/kg s hould be administered, with the full dose \\nof RIG infiltrated subcutaneously into the area around the \\nwound, if possible. Any remaining RIG that cannot be infiltrated \\ninto the wound should be administered as an intramuscular \\ninjection. Inactivated rabies vaccine should be administered \\nsimultaneously as soon as possible, at a site away from where \\nRIG was administered, with additional vaccine doses at 3, 7, and  \\n14 days.\\nor to a vaccine component, immunocompromised states, or \\npregnancy (live-virus vaccines), and moderate or severe acute \\nillness with or without fever. History of anaphylactic-like reac-\\ntions to eggs has historically been a contraindication to influenza \\nand yellow fever vaccines, which are produced in embryonated \\nchicken eggs; however, in 2016 the ACIP recommended that \\neven persons with severe egg allergy could receive any licensed \\ninfluenza vaccine. Current preparations of measles and mumps \\nvaccines, which are produced in chick embryo fibroblast tissue \\nculture, do not contain significant amounts of egg proteins and \\nmay be administered without testing children with history of \\negg allergy. Mild acute illness with or without fever, convales-\\ncent phase of illness, recent exposure to infectious diseases, \\ncurrent antimicrobial therapy, breast feeding, mild to moderate \\nlocal reaction or low-grade to moderate fever after previous \\nvaccination, and a history of penicillin or other nonvaccine \\nallergy or receiving allergen extract immunotherapy are not \\ncontraindications to immunization.\\nSevere immunosuppression resulting from congenital \\nimmunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \\ninfection, leukemia, lymphoma, cancer therapy, or a prolonged \\ncourse of high-dose corticosteroids (≥2 m g/kg/day for >2 weeks) \\npredisposes to complications and is a contraindication for live-\\nvirus vaccines. For HIV-infected children who do not have \\nevidence of severe immunosuppression, MMR vaccination is \\nrecommended at 12 months and 4-6 years of age. Varicella \\nvaccine is contraindicated for persons with cellular immunodefi-\\nciency but is recommended for persons with impaired humoral \\nimmunity (hypogammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia) \\nand at 12 months of age for HIV-infected children without \\nevidence of severe immunosuppression, given as two doses  \\n3 months apart.\\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that \\nclinically significant adverse events after vaccination be reported \\nto the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) \\n(http://www.vaers.hhs.gov or (800) 822-7967). Suspected cases \\nof vaccine-preventable diseases should be reported to state or \\nlocal health departments. The act also established the National \\nVaccine Injury Compensation Program,  a no-fault system \\nin which persons thought to have suffered an injury or death \\nas a result of administration of a covered vaccine can seek \\ncompensation.\\nPROPHYLAXIS\\nProphylaxis may include antibiotics, immunoglobulin or \\nmonoclonal antibody, and vaccine, alone or in combination. \\nThey may be used preexposure, for perinatal exposure, and \\npostexposure for persons at increased risk for infection.

The bioavailability of orally administered \\nantibiotics varies depending on the acid stability of the drug, \\ndegree of gastric acidity, and whether it is taken with food, \\nantacids, H2 blockers, or other medications. An ileus, underlying \\nintestinal disease, or profuse diarrhea may alter intestinal transit \\ntime and result in unpredictable absorption.\\nThe site and nature of the infection may affect the choice of \\nantimicrobials.

Infections of the central nervous \\nsystem or the eye necessitate treatment with antimicrobials that \\npenetrate and achieve therapeutic levels in these sites.\\nLimited renal function (as in premature infants or those \\nwith renal failure) requires lengthening dosing intervals to \\nallow time for excretion of certain drugs. The larger volume of \\ndistribution of certain hydrophilic antimicrobials and increased \\nrenal clearance (e.g., in cystic fibrosis) requires higher doses to \\nachieve therapeutic levels. Weight-based dosage regimens may \\nresult in overdoses in obese children due to significantly smaller \\nvolumes of distribution for hydrophilic drugs.

Definitive \\ntherapy relies on microbiologic diagnosis by isolation or other \\ndirect evidence of a pathogen. Microbiological diagnosis through \\nculture permits characterization of the pathogen’s antiinfective \\ndrug susceptibilities and delivery of the appropriate antiinfective \\nagent to the site of infection in concentrations sufficient to kill or \\nalter the pathogen and facilitate an effective immune response. \\nAntiviral therapy must include consideration of the intracellular \\nnature of viral replication and, to avoid toxicity to host cells, \\nmust be targeted to viral-specific proteins, such as the thymidine \\nkinase of herpesviruses or the reverse transcriptase of HIV .\\nEmpirical antimicrobial therapy is best initiated after \\nobtaining appropriate cultures of fluids or tissues.

Sepsis is the systemic \\nresponse to infection that is manifested by hyperthermia or \\nhypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and shock (see Chapter \\n40). Children with septicemia and signs of central nervous \\nsystem dysfunction (irritability, lethargy), cardiovascular impair-\\nment (cyanosis, poor perfusion), and disseminated intravascular \\ncoagulation (petechiae, ecchymosis) are readily recognized as \\ntoxic appearing or septic. Most febrile illnesses in children \\nmay be categorized as follows:\\n•\\tFever of short duration  accompanied by localizing signs \\nand symptoms, in which a diagnosis can often be established \\nby clinical history and physical examination\\n•\\t Fever without localizing signs (fever without a focus) , \\nfrequently occurring in children younger than 3 years of \\nage, in which a history and physical examination fail to \\nestablish a cause\\n•\\t Fever of unknown origin (FUO), defined as fever for >14 \\ndays without an identified etiology despite history, physical \\nexamination, and routine laboratory tests, or after 1 week \\nof intense evaluation\\nFEVER IN INFANTS YOUNGER THAN 3 \\nMONTHS OF AGE\\nFever or temperature instability in infants younger than 3 \\nmonths of age is associated with a higher risk of serious bacterial \\ninfections than in older infants. These younger infants usually \\nexhibit only fever and poor feeding, without localizing signs \\nof infection. Most febrile illnesses in this age group are caused \\nby common viral pathogens, but serious bacterial infections \\ninclude bacteremia (caused by group B streptococcus [GBS], \\nEscherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes in neonates; and \\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], \\nnontyphoidal Salmonella, and Neisseria meningitidis in 1- to \\n3-month-old infants), urinary tract infection (UTI) (E. coli), \\npneumonia (S. pneumoniae, GBS, or Staphylococcus aureus ), \\nmeningitis (GBS, E. coli, L. monocytogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. \\nmeningitidis, Hib, herpes simplex virus [HSV], enteroviruses), \\nbacterial diarrhea (Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli),  and osteo -\\nmyelitis or septic arthritis (S. aureus or GBS).\\nDifferentiating between viral and bacterial infections in young \\ninfants is difficult, but emerging studies demonstrate that doing so \\nmay be possible with the examination of inflammatory markers \\nand gene expression profiles. Febrile infants <3 months of age \\nwho appear ill, especially if follow-up is uncertain, and all febrile \\ninfants <4 weeks of age should be admitted to the hospital for \\nempirical antibiotics pending culture results. After blood, urine, \\nand cerebrospinal fluid cultures are obtained, broad-spectrum \\nparenteral antibiotics (typically ampicillin with cefotaxime or \\ngentamicin) are administered. The choice of antibiotics depends \\non the pathogens suggested by localizing findings. The possibility \\nof neonatal HSV should also be considered in febrile children \\n<4 weeks old, and empirical acyclovir begun in those in whom \\nneonatal HSV is a concern. Well-appearing febrile infants ≥4 \\nweeks of age without an identifiable focus and with certainty \\nof follow-up are at a low risk of developing a serious bacterial \\ninfection (0.8% develop bacteremia, and 2% develop a serious \\nlocalized bacterial infection). Specific criteria identifying these \\nlow-risk infants include age older than 1 month, well-appearing \\namoxicillin-clavulanate) because of synergism (significantly \\ngreater bacterial killing or spectrum of activity than when \\neither is used alone). The use of a bacteriostatic drug, such as \\na tetracycline, along with a β-lactam agent, effective against \\ngrowing organisms only, may result in antibiotic antagonism, \\nor less bacterial killing in the presence of both drugs, than if \\neither is used alone.\\nCHAPTER 96 \\nFever Without a Focus\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFever Without a Source\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nCore body temperature is normally maintained within 1-1.5°C \\nin a range of 37-38°C. Normal body temperature is generally \\nconsidered to be 37°C (98.6°F; range, 97-99.6°F). Normal \\ndiurnal variation exists, with maximum temperature in the \\nlate afternoon. Rectal temperatures higher than 38°C (>100.4°F) \\ngenerally are considered abnormal, especially if associated with \\nsymptoms.\\nNormal body temperature is maintained by a complex regula-\\ntory system in the anterior hypothalamus. The development of \\nfever begins with the release of endogenous pyrogens into the \\ncirculation as the result of infection, inflammatory processes, \\nor malignancy. Microbes and microbial toxins act as exogenous \\npyrogens by stimulating release of endogenous pyrogens, \\nincluding cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor \\nnecrosis factor, and interferons. These cytokines reach the \\nanterior hypothalamus, liberating arachidonic acid, which is \\nmetabolized to prostaglandin E2. Elevation of the hypothalamic \\nthermostat occurs via a complex interaction of complement \\nand prostaglandin E2 production. Antipyretics (acetaminophen, \\nibuprofen, aspirin) inhibit hypothalamic cyclooxygenase, \\ndecreasing production of prostaglandin E2. Aspirin is associated \\nwith Reye syndrome in children and is not recommended as an \\nantipyretic. The response to antipyretics does not distinguish \\nbacterial from viral infections.\\nThe pattern of fever in children may vary, depending on age \\nand the nature of the illness. Neonates may not have a febrile \\nresponse and may be instead be hypothermic, despite significant \\ninfection, whereas older infants and children younger than 5 \\nyears of age may have an exaggerated febrile response with \\ntemperatures of up to 105°F (40.6°C) in response to either a \\nserious bacterial infection or an otherwise benign viral infection. \\nFever to this degree is unusual in older children and adolescents \\nand suggests a serious process.

Effective phagocytosis of these \\norganisms requires opsonic antibody. Transplacentally acquired \\nmaternal immunoglobulin (Ig)G initially provides immunity \\nto these organisms, but as the IgG gradually dissipates, the risk \\nof infection increases. In the United States, use of conjugate \\nHib and S. pneumoniae vaccines has dramatically reduced \\nthe incidence of these infections, and determining the child’s \\nimmunization status is essential to evaluate the risk of these \\ninfections. An approach to evaluating these children is outlined in  \\nFig. 96.1.\\nMost episodes of fever in children younger than 3 years of \\nage have a demonstrable source of infection elicited by history, \\nphysical examination, or a simple laboratory test. In this age \\ngroup, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection \\nis a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, \\nand urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should \\nbe considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with \\nongoing fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be \\nobtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. \\nIll-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and \\ntreated with empirical antibiotics.\\nApproximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3-36 \\nmonths of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and Hib and \\nwithout localizing signs have occult bacteremia. Risk factors \\nfor occult bacteremia include temperature of 102.2°F (39°C) \\nor greater, WBC count of 15,000/mm3 or more, and elevated \\nabsolute neutrophil count, band count, erythrocyte sedimenta-\\ntion rate, or C-reactive protein. No combination of demographic \\nfactors (socioeconomic status, race, gender, and age), clini-\\ncal parameters, or laboratory tests in these children reliably \\npredicts occult bacteremia. Occult bacteremia in otherwise \\nwithout a focus of infection, no history of prematurity or prior \\nantimicrobial therapy, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5,000 \\nto 15,000/µL, urine with <10 WBCs/high-power field, and spinal \\nfluid, if obtained, with less than 5-10 WBC per microliter. Fecal \\nleukocyte testing and chest radiograph can be considered in \\ninfants with diarrhea or respiratory signs.

Sinusitis, endo -\\ncarditis, intraabdominal abscesses (perinephric, intrahepatic, \\nsubdiaphragmatic), and central nervous system lesions \\n(tuberculoma, cysticercosis, abscess, toxoplasmosis) may be \\nrelatively asymptomatic.

Rash distribution and appear-\\nance provide important clues to the differential diagnosis, \\nincluding other infectious agents (Table 97.1).\\nMEASLES (RUBEOLA)\\nEtiology\\nMeasles (rubeola) is highly contagious and is caused by a \\nsingle-stranded RNA paramyxovirus with one antigenic type. \\nHumans are the only natural host. The measles virus infects \\nthe upper respiratory tract and regional lymph nodes and is \\nspread systemically during a brief, low-titer primary viremia. \\nA secondary viremia occurs within 5-7 days as virus-infected \\nmonocytes spread the virus to the respiratory tract, skin, and \\nother organs. The virus is present in respiratory secretions, \\nblood, and the urine of infected individuals. It is transmitted \\nby droplets or via the airborne route and is extremely contagious. \\nInfected persons are contagious from 1-2 days before onset of \\nsymptoms—from about 5 days before to 4 days after the appear-\\nance of rash—and immunocompromised persons can have \\nprolonged excretion of contagious virus.\\nEpidemiology\\nMeasles remains endemic in regions of the world where measles \\nvaccination is not readily available and is responsible for about \\n20 million infections and 150,000 deaths annually. There have \\ntypically been fewer than 100 cases of measles reported annually \\nin the United States; however, outbreaks have occurred resulting \\nfrom imported virus after international travel, and in 2014 \\nthere were over 650 measles cases in the United States. Infections \\nof nonimmigrant children may occur during outbreaks among \\nthose too young to be vaccinated or in communities with low \\nimmunization rates. Most young infants are protected by \\ntransplacentally acquired maternal antibody until the end of \\ntheir first year.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nMeasles infection is divided into four phases: incubation, \\nprodromal (catarrhal), exanthematous (rash), and recovery. \\nThe incubation period is 8-12 days from exposure to symptom \\nonset and a mean of 14 days (range: 7-21) from exposure to \\nrash onset.

Humans are the only \\nnatural host. Rubella virus invades the respiratory epithelium \\nand disseminates via a primary viremia. After replication in \\nthe reticuloendothelial system, a secondary viremia ensues, \\nand the virus can be isolated from peripheral blood monocytes, \\ncerebrospinal fluid, and urine. Rubella virus is most contagious \\nthrough direct or droplet contact with nasopharyngeal secretions \\nfrom 2 days before until 5-7 days after rash onset, although \\nthe virus may be present in nasopharyngeal secretions from 7 \\ndays before until 14 days after the rash.\\nInfection in utero  results in significant morbidity from \\ncongenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with associated ophthal-\\nmological, cardiac, and neurological manifestations (see Chapter \\n66). Maternal infection during the first trimester results in \\nfetal infection with generalized vasculitis in more than 90% of \\ncases. Infants with CRS may shed the virus in nasopharyngeal \\nsecretions and urine for >12 months after birth and transmit \\nit to susceptible contacts.\\nEpidemiology\\nIn unvaccinated populations, rubella usually occurs in the spring, \\nwith epidemics occurring in cycles of every 6-9 years. Approxi-\\nmately 25-50% of cases are subclinical. Fewer than 20 cases of \\nrubella now occur annually in the United States. Outbreaks \\noccasionally occur in nonvaccinated groups from internationally \\nimported cases. Transplacentally acquired antibody is protective \\nduring the first 6 months of life.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nthe outcome of infants with measles in developing countries. \\nThe World Health Organization recommends routine admin-\\nistration of vitamin A for 2 days to all children with acute \\nmeasles, regardless of country of residence.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nOtitis media is the most common complication of measles \\ninfection. Interstitial (measles) pneumonia can occur, or \\npneumonia may result from secondary bacterial infection with \\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or group A \\nstreptococcus. Persons with impaired cell-mediated immunity \\nmay develop giant cell (Hecht) pneumonia, which is usually \\nfatal. Myocarditis and mesenteric lymphadenitis are infrequent \\ncomplications.\\nEncephalomyelitis occurs in 1-2 per 1,000 cases and usually \\noccurs 2-5 days after the onset of the rash. Early encephalitis \\nprobably is caused by direct viral infection of brain tissue, \\nwhereas later onset encephalitis is a demyelinating, and probably \\nan immunopathological, phenomenon. Subacute sclerosing \\npanencephalitis (SSPE) is a late neurological complication \\nof slow measles infection that is characterized by progressive \\nbehavioral and intellectual deterioration and eventual death. It \\noccurs in approximately 1 in every 1 million cases of measles, \\nan average of 8-10 years after measles. There is no effective  \\ntreatment.\\nDeaths most frequently result from bronchopneumonia or \\nencephalitis, with much higher risk in persons with malignancy, \\nsevere malnutrition, age under 5 years, or immunocompromise \\n(such as HIV infection). Late deaths in adolescents and adults \\nusually result from SSPE. Other forms of measles encephalitis \\nin immunocompetent persons are associated with a mortality \\nrate of approximately 15%, with 20-30% of survivors having \\nserious neurological sequelae.\\nPrevention\\nLive measles vaccine prevents infection and is recommended \\nas measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) for children at 12-15 \\nmonths and 4-6 years of age. The MMRV (MMR combined \\nwith varicella vaccine) is an alternative vaccine for children 12 \\nmonths to 12 years of age, provided there are no contraindica-\\ntions, but is associated with a higher rate of febrile seizures \\nfollowing administration. The second dose of MMR is not a \\nbooster dose but significantly reduces the primary vaccine \\nfailure rate, from <5% to <1%. Contraindications to measles \\nvaccine include immunocompromised states or an immunosup-\\npressive course of corticosteroids ( >2 mg/kg/day or >20 mg/\\nday for those weighing >10 kg, for >14 days); pregnancy; or \\nrecent administration of immunoglobulin (within 3-11 months, \\ndepending on dose). MMR vaccination is recommended for \\nall HIV-infected persons without evidence of severe immunosup-\\npression (low age-specific CD4 T lymphocytes), children with \\ncancer in remission who have not received chemotherapy in \\nthe previous 3 months, and children who have not received \\nimmunosuppressive corticosteroids in the previous month. \\nSusceptible household contacts with a chronic disease or who \\nare immunocompromised should receive postexposure pro-\\nphylaxis with measles vaccine within 72 hours of measles \\nexposure or immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFever and Rash\\nThe incubation period for postnatal rubella is typically 16-18 \\ndays (range: 14-21 days). The mild catarrhal symptoms of the \\nprodromal phase of rubella may go unnoticed. The characteristic \\nsigns of rubella are retroauricular, posterior cervical, and \\nposterior occipital lymphadenopathy accompanied by an \\nerythematous, maculopapular, discrete rash. The rash begins \\non the face and spreads to the body, lasting for 3 days, and is \\nless prominent than that of measles. Rose-colored spots on the \\nsoft palate, known as Forchheimer spots, develop in 20% of \\npatients and may appear before the rash. Other manifestations \\nof rubella include mild pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, anorexia, \\nheadache, malaise, and low-grade fever.

HHV-6 and HHV-7 are large, \\nenveloped double-stranded DNA viruses that are members of \\nthe herpesvirus family. Two species of HHV-6―HHV-6A and \\nHHV-6B―exist, with almost all postnatal infections caused \\nby HHV-6B. These viruses infect mature mononuclear cells \\nand cause a relatively prolonged (3-5 days) viremia during \\nprimary infection. They can be detected in the saliva of \\nhealthy adults, which suggests, as with other herpesviruses, the \\ndevelopment of lifelong latent infection and intermittent viral  \\nshedding.\\nEpidemiology\\nTransplacentally acquired antibody protects most infants until \\n6 months of age. The incidence of infection increases as \\nmaternally derived antibody levels decline. By 12 months of \\nage, approximately 60-90% of children have antibodies to \\nHHV-6, and essentially all children are seropositive by 2-3 \\nyears of age. The virus is likely acquired from asymptomatic \\nadults who periodically shed these viruses. HHV-6 is a major \\ncause of acute febrile illnesses in infants and may be responsible \\nfor up to 20% of visits to the emergency department for children \\n6-18 months of age.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nRoseola is characterized by high fever (often >40°C) with an \\nabrupt onset that lasts 3-5 days. A maculopapular, rose-colored \\nrash erupts coincident with defervescence, although it may be \\npresent earlier. The rash usually lasts 1-3 days but may fade \\nrapidly and is not present in all infants with HHV-6 infection. \\nUpper respiratory symptoms, nasal congestion, erythematous \\ntympanic membranes, and cough may occur. Gastrointestinal \\nsymptoms are described. Roseola is associated with approxi-\\nmately one third of febrile seizures. Roseola caused by HHV-6 \\nand HHV-7 are clinically indistinguishable, although HHV-\\n6-associated roseola typically occurs in younger infants. \\nReactivation of HHV-6 following bone marrow transplantation \\nmay result in bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, rash, and \\nencephalitis.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nRoutine laboratory findings are nonspecific and do not aid in \\ndiagnosis. Encephalitis with roseola is characterized by pleo-\\ncytosis (30-200 cells/mm3) with mononuclear cell predominance, \\nelevated protein concentration, and normal glucose concentra-\\ntion. Serological testing showing a fourfold rise in acute and \\nconvalescent sera or documentation of HHV-6 DNA by PCR \\nin the cerebrospinal fluid is diagnostic. PCR has also been used \\nto detect HHV-6 in blood but may not be sensitive in primary \\ninfection.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe pattern of high fever for 3-5 days without significant \\nphysical findings followed by onset of rash with subsequent \\nnormal or low, and thrombocytopenia rarely occurs. Diag -\\nnosis is confirmed by serological testing for IgM antibodies \\n(typically positive 5 days after symptom onset) or by a four-\\nfold or greater increase in specific IgG antibodies in paired \\nacute and convalescent sera. CRS cases can have detectable \\nIgM until 3 months of age and stable or rising IgG titers \\nover the first 7-11 months of age. False-positive IgM results \\ncan occur. Cases of suspected CRS and postnatal rubella \\ninfection should be reported to the local and state health  \\ndepartment.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe rash must be differentiated from measles, roseola, enteroviral \\nor adenoviral infection, infectious mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, \\nscarlet fever, rickettsial disease, Kawasaki disease, serum sickness, \\nand drug rash.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific therapy for rubella, and treatment is \\nsupportive.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nOther than CRS (see Chapter 66) arising from rubella infection \\nduring pregnancy, complications are rare. Deaths rarely occur \\nwith rubella encephalitis.\\nPrevention\\nLive rubella vaccine prevents infection and is recommended \\nas MMR for children at 12-15 months and at 4-6 years of \\nage. After vaccination, rubella virus is shed from the naso-\\npharynx for several weeks, but it is not communicable. In \\nchildren, rubella vaccine rarely is associated with adverse \\neffects, but in postpubertal females, it causes arthralgias \\nin 25% of vaccinated individuals and acute arthritis-like \\nsymptoms in 10% of vaccinated individuals. These symp-\\ntoms typically develop 1-3 weeks after vaccination and last  \\n1-3 days.\\nContraindications to rubella vaccine include immuno-\\ncompromised states or an immunosuppressive course of \\ncorticosteroids (>2 m g/kg/day or >20 mg/day for those weighing \\n>10 kg, for >14 days); pregnancy; or recent administration of \\nimmunoglobulin (within 3-11 months, depending on dose). \\nVaccine virus has been recovered from fetal tissues, although no \\ncases of CRS have been identified among infants born to women \\ninadvertently vaccinated against rubella during pregnancy. \\nNevertheless, women are cautioned to avoid pregnancy for 28 \\ndays after receiving the rubella-containing vaccine. All pregnant \\nwomen should have prenatal serological testing to determine \\ntheir immune status to rubella, and susceptible mothers should \\nbe vaccinated after delivery and before hospital discharge.\\nSusceptible, nonpregnant persons exposed to rubella should \\nreceive rubella vaccination. Immunoglobulin is not recom -\\nmended for postexposure prophylaxis of susceptible, pregnant \\nwomen exposed to rubella.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The rash appears in three stages. The initial stage \\nis typically a “slapped cheek” rash with circumoral pallor. An \\nerythematous symmetric, maculopapular, truncal rash appears \\n1-4 days later, then fades as central clearing takes place, giving \\na distinctive lacy, reticulated rash that lasts 2-40 days (mean: \\n11 days). This rash may be pruritic, does not desquamate, and \\nmay recur with exercise, bathing, rubbing, or stress. Adolescents \\nand adults may experience myalgia, significant arthralgias or \\narthritis, headache, pharyngitis, coryza, and gastrointestinal \\nupset.\\nChildren with shortened erythrocyte life span (e.g., \\nsickle cell disease) may develop a transient aplastic crisis , \\nwhich is characterized by ineffective erythroid production \\ntypically lasting 7-10 days (see Chapter 150). Most children \\nwith parvovirus B19-induced transient aplastic crisis have \\nmultiple symptoms, including fever, lethargy, malaise, \\npallor, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and respiratory \\nsymptoms. The reticulocyte count is extremely low, and the \\nhemoglobin level is lower than usual for the patient. Tran-\\nsient neutropenia and thrombocytopenia also commonly  \\noccur.\\nPersistent parvovirus B19 infection may develop in children \\nwith immunodeficiency, causing severe anemia resulting from \\npure red blood cell aplasia. These children do not display the \\ntypical manifestations of erythema infectiosum.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nHematological abnormalities occur with parvovirus infection, \\nincluding reticulocytopenia lasting 7-10 days, mild anemia, \\nthrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia. Parvovirus \\nB19 can be detected by PCR and by electron microscopy of \\nerythroid precursors in the bone marrow. Serological tests \\nshowing specific IgM antibody to parvovirus are diagnostic, \\ndemonstrating an infection that probably occurred in the prior \\n2-4 months. Parvovirus PCR of blood and cerebrospinal fluid \\nis also available, primarily for use in severe illness or immuno-\\ncompromised patients.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of erythema infectiosum in children is established \\non the basis of the clinical findings of typical facial rash with \\nabsent or mild prodromal symptoms, followed by a reticulated \\nrash over the body that waxes and wanes. The differential \\ndiagnosis includes measles, rubella, scarlet fever, enteroviral \\nor adenoviral infection, infectious mononucleosis, Kawasaki \\ndisease, systemic lupus erythematosus, serum sickness, and \\ndrug reaction.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific therapy other than routine supportive care. \\nTransfusions may be required for transient aplastic crisis. \\nIntrauterine transfusion has been performed for hydrops fetalis \\nassociated with fetal parvovirus B19 infection. Intravenous \\nimmunoglobulin may be used for immunocompromised persons \\nwith severe anemia or chronic infection.\\ndefervescence is characteristic. Many febrile illnesses may \\nbe easily confused with roseola during the preeruptive stage. \\nSerious infections must be excluded, although most children \\nare alert, behave normally, and continue with their usual daily  \\nactivities.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific therapy for roseola. Routine supportive \\ncare includes maintaining adequate hydration and antipyretics. \\nIn immunocompromised hosts, use of ganciclovir or foscarnet \\ncan be considered.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nThe prognosis for roseola is excellent. A few deaths have been \\nattributed to HHV-6, usually in cases complicated by encephalitis \\nor virus-associated hemophagocytosis syndrome.\\nPrevention\\nNo preventative measures are available.\\nERYTHEMA INFECTIOSUM (FIFTH DISEASE)\\nEtiology\\nErythema infectiosum (fifth disease) is caused by the human \\nparvovirus B19, a single-stranded DNA virus producing a benign \\nviral exanthem in healthy children. The viral affinity for red \\nblood cell progenitor cells makes it an important cause of aplastic \\ncrisis in patients with hemolytic anemias, including sickle cell \\ndisease, spherocytosis, and thalassemia. Parvovirus B19 also \\ncauses fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis after primary infection \\nduring pregnancy. The cell receptor for parvovirus B19 is the \\nerythrocyte P antigen, a glycolipid present on erythroid cells. \\nThe virus replicates in actively dividing erythroid stem cells, \\nleading to cell death that results in erythroid aplasia  \\nand anemia.\\nEpidemiology\\nErythema infectiosum is common. Parvovirus B19 seropreva-\\nlence is only 2-9% in children younger than 5 years of age but \\nincreases to 15-35% in children 5-18 years and 30-60% in adults. \\nCommunity epidemics usually occur in the spring. The virus \\nis transmitted by respiratory secretions and by blood product \\ntransfusions.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe incubation period is typically 4-14 days and, rarely, may \\nlast 21 days. Parvovirus B19 infections usually begin with a \\nmild, nonspecific illness characterized by fever, malaise, myalgias, \\nand headache. In some cases, the characteristic rash appears \\n7-10 days later. Erythema infectiosum is manifested by rash, \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Fatalities \\nassociated with transient aplastic crisis are rare. Parvovirus \\nB19 is not teratogenic, but in utero infection of fetal ery-\\nthroid cells may result in fetal heart failure, hydrops fetalis, \\nand fetal death. Of the approximately 50% of women of \\nchildbearing age susceptible to parvovirus B19 infection, 30% \\nof exposed women develop infection, with 25% of exposed \\nfetuses becoming infected and 10% of these culminating in  \\nfetal death.\\nPrevention\\nThe greatest risk is to pregnant women. Effective control \\nmeasures are limited. The exclusion of affected children from \\nschool is not recommended because children generally are not \\ninfectious by the time the rash is present. Good handwashing \\nand hygiene are practical measures that should help reduce \\ntransmission.\\nVARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS INFECTION \\n(CHICKENPOX AND ZOSTER)\\nEtiology\\nChickenpox and zoster are caused by varicella-zoster virus \\n(VZV), an enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA virus \\nthat is a member of the herpesvirus family. Humans are the \\nonly natural host. Chickenpox (varicella) is the manifestation \\nof primary infection. VZV infects susceptible individuals via \\nthe conjunctivae or respiratory tract and replicates in the \\nnasopharynx and upper respiratory tract. It disseminates by a \\nprimary viremia and infects regional lymph nodes, the liver, \\nthe spleen, and other organs. A secondary viremia follows, \\nresulting in a cutaneous infection with the typical vesicular \\nrash. After resolution of chickenpox, the virus persists in latent \\ninfection in the dorsal root ganglia cells. Zoster (shingles) is \\nthe manifestation of reactivated latent infection of endogenous \\nVZV . Chickenpox is highly communicable in susceptible \\nindividuals, with a secondary attack rate of more than 90%. \\nThe period of communicability ranges from 2 days before \\nto 7 days after the onset of the rash, when all lesions are  \\ncrusted.\\nEpidemiology\\nIn the prevaccine era, the peak age of occurrence was 5-10 \\nyears, with peak seasonal infection in late winter and spring. \\nIn the postvaccine era, the incidence of varicella has declined \\nin all age groups, with the peak incidence now in 10-14-year-\\nolds. Transmission is by direct contact, droplet, and air. Zoster, \\nhowever, is contagious by direct contact. Only 5% of cases of \\nzoster occur in children younger than 15 years of age. The \\noverall incidence of zoster (215 cases per 100,000 person-years) \\nresults in a cumulative lifetime incidence of approximately \\n10-20%, with 75% of cases occurring after 45 years of age. The \\nincidence of zoster is increased in immunocompromised \\npersons.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAtaxia\\nAlopecia\\nVesicles and Bullae\\nFever and Rash\\nPetechiae/Purpura\\nThe incubation period of varicella is generally 14-16 days, with \\na range of 10-21 days after exposure. Prodromal symptoms of \\nfever, malaise, and anorexia may precede the rash by 1 day. \\nThe characteristic rash appears initially as small red papules \\nthat rapidly progress to nonumbilicated, oval, “teardrop” vesicles \\non an erythematous base. The fluid progresses from clear to \\ncloudy, and the vesicles ulcerate, crust, and heal. New crops \\nappear for 3-4 days, usually beginning on the trunk followed \\nby the head, the face, and, less commonly, the extremities. \\nThere may be a total of 100-500 lesions, with all forms of lesions \\nbeing present at the same time. Pruritus is universal and marked. \\nLesions may be present on mucous membranes. Lymphade-\\nnopathy may be generalized. The severity of the rash varies, as \\ndo systemic signs and fever, which generally abate after 3-4 \\ndays.\\nThe preeruption phase of zoster includes intense localized \\nand burning pain and tenderness (acute neuritis) along a \\ndermatome, accompanied by malaise and fever. In several days, \\nthe eruption of papules, which quickly vesiculate, occurs in \\nthe dermatome or in two adjacent dermatomes. Groups of \\nlesions occur for 1-7 days and then progress to crusting and \\nhealing. Thoracic and lumbar regions are typically involved. \\nLesions generally are unilateral and are accompanied by regional \\nlymphadenopathy. In one third of patients, a few vesicles occur \\noutside the primary dermatome. Any branch of cranial nerve \\nV may be involved, which also may cause corneal and intraoral \\nlesions. Involvement of cranial nerve VII may result in facial \\nparalysis and ear canal vesicles (Ramsay Hunt syndrome).  \\nOphthalmic zoster may be associated with ipsilateral cerebral \\nangiitis and stroke. Immunocompromised persons may have \\nunusually severe, painful herpes zoster that involves cutaneous \\nand, rarely, visceral dissemination (to liver, lungs, and central \\nnervous system). Postherpetic neuralgia, defined as pain \\npersisting longer than 1 month, is uncommon in children.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nLaboratory testing confirmation for diagnosis is usually unneces-\\nsary. PCR is the current diagnostic method of choice, and \\ngenotyping to distinguish vaccine and wild-type strains is \\navailable through the CDC. Detection of varicella-specific \\nantigen in vesicular fluid by immunofluorescence using mono-\\nclonal antibodies or demonstration of a fourfold antibody \\nincrease of acute and convalescent sera is also diagnostic but \\nnot as sensitive as PCR.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of varicella and zoster is based on the distinctive \\ncharacteristics of the rash.

The \\nmortality rate is much higher for persons older than 20 years \\nof age and for immunocompromised persons. Zoster usually is \\nself-limited, especially in children. Advanced age and severity of \\npain at presentation and at 1 month are predictors of prolonged \\npain. Scarring is more common with zoster because of the \\ninvolvement of the deeper layers of the skin.\\nPrevention\\nChildren with chickenpox should not return to school until \\nall vesicles have crusted. A hospitalized child with chickenpox \\nand immunocompromised patients with zoster should be \\nisolated in a negative-pressure room to prevent transmission. \\nZoster transmission can be minimized by covering the affected  \\narea.\\nA live, two-dose attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended \\nfor all children.

The differentiation between \\nzoster and HSV infection may be difficult because HSV may \\ncause eruption that appears to be in a dermatomal distribution. \\nCoxsackievirus A infection has a vesiculopustular appearance, \\nbut lesions are usually localized to the extremities and oro-\\npharynx. A previously healthy patient with more than one \\nrecurrence probably has the HSV infection, which can be \\nconfirmed by viral culture or PCR.\\nTreatment\\nSymptomatic therapy of varicella includes nonaspirin antipyret-\\nics, cool baths, and careful hygiene. Routine oral administration \\nof acyclovir is not recommended in otherwise healthy children \\nwith varicella. The decision to use antiviral medications, the \\nroute, and the duration of treatment depend on host factors \\nand the risk for severe infection or complications. Early therapy \\nwith antivirals (especially within 24 hours of rash onset) in \\nimmunocompromised persons is effective in preventing severe \\ncomplications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death \\nfrom varicella. Acyclovir or valacyclovir may be considered in \\nthose at risk of severe varicella, such as unvaccinated persons \\nolder than 12 years; those with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary \\ndisease; receiving short-course, intermittent, or aerosolized \\ncorticosteroids; or receiving long-term salicylate therapy. The \\ndose of acyclovir used for VZV infections is much higher than \\nthat for HSV .\\nAntiviral treatment of zoster accelerates cutaneous healing, \\nhastens the resolution of acute neuritis, and reduces the risk \\nof postherpetic neuralgia. Oral famciclovir and valacyclovir \\nhave much greater oral bioavailability than acyclovir and are \\nrecommended for treatment of zoster in adults. Acyclovir is \\nrecommended for children and is an alternative therapy for \\nadults.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nSecondary infection of skin lesions by streptococci or staphy-\\nlococci is the most common complication. These infections \\nmay be mild, resembling impetigo, or life-threatening with \\ntoxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis. Pneumonia is \\nuncommon in healthy children but occurs in 15-20% of healthy \\nadults and immunocompromised persons. Myocarditis, peri-\\ncarditis, orchitis, hepatitis, ulcerative gastritis, glomerulone -\\nphritis, and arthritis may complicate varicella. Reye syndrome \\nmay follow varicella; thus salicylate use is contraindicated during \\nvaricella infection.\\nNeurological complications frequently include postinfectious \\nencephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus, and tremor. Less \\ncommon neurological complications include Guillain-Barré \\nsyndrome, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, optic \\nneuritis, and hypothalamic syndrome.\\nPrimary varicella can be a fatal disease in immuno-\\ncompromised persons as a result of visceral dissemination, \\nencephalitis, hepatitis, and pneumonitis.

Warning \\nsigns of necrotizing fasciitis include pain out of proportion \\nto evident skin lesions, shock or toxic appearance, or crepitus \\ndue to subcutaneous gas formation by anaerobes. Necrotizing \\nfasciitis is a surgical emergency, and early consultation with an \\nexperienced surgeon is recommended. Adjunctive tests such \\nas magnetic resonance imaging can confirm the presence of \\ngas in tissues, but obtaining imaging should not delay surgical \\nconsultation. Treatment includes rapid surgical debridement of \\nall necrotic tissues and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, \\nsuch as clindamycin plus cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, with or \\nwithout an aminoglycoside or vancomycin.\\nFolliculitis\\nFolliculitis refers to small, dome-shaped pustules or erythe -\\nmatous papules predominantly caused by S. aureus and is located \\nin hair follicles, with superficial, limited inflammatory reaction \\nin the surrounding tissue. Furuncles (boils) are deeper hair \\nfollicle infections that manifest as nodules with intense sur -\\nrounding inflammatory reaction. These occur most frequently \\non the neck, trunk, axillae, and buttocks. A carbuncle represents \\nthe deepest of hair follicle infections and is characterized by \\nmultiseptate, loculated abscesses. Boils and carbuncles frequently \\nrequire incisional drainage. Superficial folliculitis can be treated \\nwith topical therapy, such as an antibacterial chlorhexidine \\nwash or an antibacterial lotion or solution such as clindamycin \\n1%, applied twice a day for 7-10 days. Oral antibiotics are \\nnecessary for unresponsive cases, or for furuncles and \\ncarbuncles.\\nP . aeruginosa folliculitis (hot tub folliculitis) presents \\nas pruritic papules; pustules; or deeper, purple-red nodules \\npredominantly on skin areas covered by a swimsuit after bathing \\nin hot tubs. Folliculitis develops 8-48 hours after exposure, \\nusually without associated systemic symptoms, and resolves \\nin 1-2 weeks without treatment.\\nPerianal Dermatitis\\nPerianal dermatitis (perianal streptococcal disease) is caused \\nby group A streptococcus and is characterized by well-\\ndemarcated, very tender, marked perianal erythema extending \\n2 cm f rom the anus. Manifestations include anal pruritus and \\npainful defecation, sometimes with blood-streaked stools.

Streptococcal impetigo is associated \\nwith increased risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, but not \\nacute rheumatic fever (see Chapter 163). Antibiotic treatment \\ndoes not decrease the risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, \\nbut it does decrease the possible spread of nephritogenic strains \\nto close contacts.

Cellulitis typically presents with indurated, warm, \\nand erythematous macules with indistinct borders that can \\nexpand rapidly. Additional manifestations commonly include \\nfever, lymphangitis, and regional lymphadenitis. Erysipelas \\nis a superficial variant of cellulitis usually caused by group \\nA streptococcus that involves the dermis only. The rapidly \\nadvancing lesions are tender, bright red in appearance, and \\nhave sharp margins. The patients may appear toxic. Blood \\ncultures are recommended for erysipelas. Empirical antibiotic \\ntreatment for cellulitis is recommended with a first-generation \\ncephalosporin unless the local S. aureus methicillin-resistance \\nrate is high, in which case alternatives include clindamycin \\nor trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Many patients may be \\nmanaged with oral antibiotics and close follow-up; hospi-\\ntalization and intravenous antibiotics are recommended for \\nerysipelas and cellulitis of the face, hands, feet, or perineum; \\nthose with lymphangitis; and those not responding to outpatient  \\ntherapy.\\nEcthyma usually is caused by group A streptococcus and \\nmay complicate impetigo. Initially it is characterized by a \\nlesion with a rim of erythematous induration surrounding an \\neschar, which, if removed, reveals a shallow ulcer. Ecthyma \\ngangrenosum is a serious skin infection occurring in \\nimmunocompromised persons due to hematogenous spread \\nof septic emboli to the skin, classically caused by Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa, other gram-negative organisms, or occasionally \\nAspergillus.

More than 100 HPV \\nserotypes have been identified, with different serotypes account-\\ning for the variation in location and clinical presentations. There \\nare 15-20 oncogenic (high-risk) types, including 16, 18, 31, \\n33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, and 58. HPV types 16 and 18 are associated \\nwith 70% of cases of cervical cancer as well as vulvar and vaginal \\ncancers. Common nononcogenic (low-risk) types include 1, \\n2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, and 54. Regardless of the infecting \\nserotype, all warts are associated with hyperplasia of the epi-\\ndermal cells.\\nWarts occur at all ages. Common warts (verruca vulgaris), \\nassociated with HPV types 1 and 2, are the most frequent form \\n(71%). They occur in school-age children, with a prevalence \\nof 4-20%. They are transmitted by direct contact or by fomites \\nand have an incubation period of approximately 1 month \\nbefore clinical presentation. The common wart is a painless, \\nwell-circumscribed, small (2-5  mm) p apule with a papillated \\nor verrucous surface typically distributed on the fingers, toes, \\nelbows, and knees. They also may be found on the nose, ears, \\nand lips. Filiform warts are verrucous, exophytic, 2-mm \\npapules that have a narrow or pedunculated base. Flat warts \\n(verruca plana) are associated with HPV types 3 and 10 and are \\nmultiple, flat-topped 2-4-mm papules clustered on the dorsal \\nsurface of the hands, on the soles of the feet (plantar warts), \\nor on the face. Plantar warts may be painful because of the \\neffect of pressure and friction on the lesions. Genital warts \\n(condylomata acuminata) are associated with the HPV types \\n6 and 11 (90%). They are flesh-colored, hyperpigmented, or \\nerythematous lesions that are filiform, fungating, or plaque-like \\nin appearance and involve multiple sites on the vulva, vagina, \\npenis, or perineum. Genital warts are the most common \\nsexually transmitted infection, with 1 million new cases  \\nannually.\\nWarts typically are self-limited and resolve spontaneously \\nover years without specific treatment. Treatment options \\nare available for common and flat warts as well as condy-\\nlomata acuminata. Topical preparations for common and \\nflat warts disrupt infected epithelium (using salicylic acid, \\nliquid nitrogen, or laser therapy) and result in the cure of \\napproximately 75% of patients. Treatment of anogenital warts \\nrequires assessment of size, number, patient preference, cost, \\nconvenience, and adverse effects. Medications may include \\ntopical podophyllotoxin or imiquimod. Additional treatment \\nmethods include laser ablation and immunotherapy with \\nintralesional interferon; immunotherapy may result in significant  \\ntoxicities.\\nThe most serious consequence of HPV infection is \\ncervical cancer  (more than 12,000 new cases annually) \\nas well as vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and head and neck \\ncancers. Three main recombinant HPV vaccines are avail-\\nable. A quadrivalent vaccine against serotypes 6, 11, 31, and \\n33 was licensed in 2006 for use in all children and adults \\nbetween 9 and 26 years of age. A 9-valent vaccine protect-\\ning against serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 \\nwas licensed in 2014 for use in females 9 through 26 years \\nand males 9 through 15 years. A bivalent vaccine against \\nserotypes 16 and 18 is also available for females only. The \\nthree-dose regimen of these vaccines has >98% efficacy in \\npreventing the precancerous dysplasia that precedes cervical  \\ncancer.\\nPrimary herpetic infections can occur after inoculation of the \\nvirus at any mucocutaneous site. Herpes simplex virus type 1 \\n(HSV-1) is common in children and classically causes gingi-\\nvostomatitis, whereas HSV-2 classically infects the genitalia as \\na sexually transmitted infection (see Chapter 116), though \\nHSV-1 may cause approximately 30% of genital herpes, and \\nHSV-2 can cause gingivostomatitis. For the cutaneous manifesta-\\ntions of neonatal HSV infection, see Chapter 65.\\nHerpes gingivostomatitis involves the gingivae and the \\nvermilion border of the lips. Herpes labialis (cold sores or \\nfever blisters) is limited to the vermilion border involving skin \\nand mucous membranes. Clinical manifestations of primary \\nHSV gingivostomatitis include typical oropharyngeal vesicular \\nlesions with high fever, malaise, stinging mouth pain, drooling, \\nfetid breath, and cervical lymphadenopathy.\\nHerpetic skin lesions are quite painful and characteristically \\nbegin as erythematous papules that quickly progress to the \\ncharacteristically grouped, 2-4  mm, fl uid-filled vesicles on \\nan erythematous base. Removal of the vesicle roof reveals a \\nsmall, sharply demarcated ulcer with a punched-out appear-\\nance. The characteristic grouped vesicles distinguish HSV \\nfrom chickenpox (see Chapter 97). Within several days, the \\nvesicles become pustular, rupture, and encrust. Diagnosis is \\nmade clinically, or with viral culture, fluorescent antibody \\nstaining, or most often polymerase chain reaction. Scarring \\nis uncommon, but there may be residual hyperpigmentation. \\nAfter primary infection, the virus remains latent in nerve dorsal \\nroot ganglia. About 20-40% of adults experience recurrent \\noral episodes of HSV labialis throughout life. Recurrences \\noccur in roughly the same location and may be preceded by \\nprodromal symptoms of tingling or burning without fever or  \\nlymphadenopathy.\\nViral paronychia (herpetic whitlow) is a painful, localized \\ninfection of a digit, usually of the distal pulp space, with \\nerythematous and occasionally vesiculopustular eruption. It \\noccurs in children who suck their thumbs, bite their nails, \\nand those with herpetic gingivostomatitis. Herpes gladiatorum \\noccurs in wrestlers and rugby players who acquire cutane -\\nous herpes from close body contact with other players’ \\ncutaneous infections. Cutaneous HSV infection in persons \\nwith an underlying skin disorder (e.g., atopic dermatitis) \\ncan result in eczema herpeticum (Kaposi varicelliform \\neruption), a disseminated cutaneous infection. There may \\nbe hundreds of herpetic vesicles over the body, usually \\nconcentrated in the areas of skin affected by the underlying  \\ndisorder.\\nTreatment with oral valacyclovir or famciclovir may shorten \\nduration of disease for primary and recurrent infection. Prophy-\\nlactic antiviral therapy may be warranted in those with frequent \\nrecurrences. Neonates, persons with eczema, and persons with \\nimmunodeficiency are at increased risk for disseminated and \\nsevere HSV disease and should receive intravenous acyclovir \\ntherapy.\\nHuman Papillomaviruses (Warts)\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHoarseness\\nVaginal Discharge\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Papules occur most commonly in inter-\\ntriginous regions, such as the axillae, groin, and neck. They \\nrarely occur on the face or in the periocular region. The infection \\ntypically affects toddlers and young children and is acquired \\nthrough direct contact with infected individuals. Spread occurs \\nby autoinoculation. Infection with molluscum contagiosum \\nmay be complicated by a surrounding dermatitis. Severely \\nimmunocompromised persons or persons with extensive atopic \\ndermatitis often have widespread lesions.\\nDiagnosis is clinical. Lesions are self-limited, resolving over \\nmonths to years, and usually no specific treatment is recom -\\nmended.

Normal lymph node size is 10 mm  \\nin diameter, with the exceptions of 15 mm f or inguinal nodes, \\n5 mm f or epitrochlear nodes, and 2  mm f or supraclavicular \\nnodes, which are usually not palpable. Lymphadenopathy is \\nenlargement of lymph nodes and occurs in response to a wide \\nvariety of infectious, inflammatory, and malignant processes. \\nGeneralized lymphadenopathy is enlargement of two or more \\nnoncontiguous lymph node groups, whereas regional lymph-\\nadenopathy involves one lymph node group only.\\nLymphadenitis is acute or chronic inflammation of lymph \\nnodes. Acute lymphadenitis usually results when bacteria and \\ntoxins from a site of acute inflammation are carried via lymph \\nto regional nodes. Numerous infections cause lymphadenopathy \\nand lymphadenitis (Tables 99.1 and 99.2). Causes of inguinal \\nregional lymphadenopathy also include sexually transmitted \\ninfections (see Chapter 116). Regional lymphadenitis associated \\nwith a characteristic skin lesion at the site of inoculation defines \\nvarious lymphocutaneous syndromes. Lymphangitis is an \\ninflammation of subcutaneous lymphatic channels that presents \\nas an acute bacterial infection, usually caused by Staphylococcus \\naureus and group A streptococci.\\nCervical lymphadenitis is the most common regional \\nlymphadenitis among children and is associated most commonly \\nwith pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcus (see Chapter \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Other \\nfindings include splenomegaly in 50% of cases, hepatomegaly \\nin 10-20%, and maculopapular or urticarial rash in 5-15%. A \\ndiffuse, erythematous rash develops in approximately 80% of \\nmononucleosis patients treated with amoxicillin. EBV , a member \\nof the herpesvirus family, infects B lymphocytes and is spread by \\nsalivary secretions. After primary infection, EBV is maintained \\nlatently in multiple episomes in the cell nucleus of resting B \\nlymphocytes and establishes a lifelong infection that remains \\nclinically inapparent. Most persons shed EBV intermittently, \\nwith approximately 20% of healthy individuals shedding EBV \\nat any given time.\\nCMV , Toxoplasma gondii, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus, \\nhepatitis C virus, and acute HIV infection, also known as acute \\nretroviral syndrome, can cause an infectious mononucleosis-like \\nsyndrome with lymphadenopathy. Compared with EBV infec-\\ntion, infectious mononucleosis-like illness caused by CMV has \\nminimal pharyngitis and often more prominent splenomegaly; it \\noften presents with fever only. The most common manifestation \\nof toxoplasmosis is asymptomatic cervical lymphadenopathy, but \\napproximately 10% of cases of acquired toxoplasmosis develop \\nchronic posterior cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue, usually \\nwithout significant fever.\\nThe cause of cat-scratch disease is B. henselae, a small, \\npleomorphic, gram-negative bacillus that stains with Warthin-\\nStarry silver stain. B. henselae causes apparently asymptomatic \\nbacteremia in cats; kittens under 1 year of age are more likely to \\nharbor the organism. B. henselae is transmitted to humans by \\nbites and scratches, which may be minor. B. henselae also causes \\nbacillary angiomatosis and peliosis hepatis in persons with HIV \\ninfection (see Chapter 125). Cat-scratch disease typically presents \\nwith a cutaneous papule or conjunctival granuloma at the site \\nof bacterial inoculation, followed by lymphadenopathy of the \\ndraining regional nodes. The nodes are tender with suppuration \\nin approximately 10% of cases. Lymphadenopathy may persist \\n1-4 months. Less common features of cat-scratch disease include \\nerythema nodosum, osteolytic lesions, encephalitis, oculoglan-\\ndular (Parinaud) syndrome, hepatic or splenic granulomas, \\nendocarditis, polyneuritis, and transverse myelitis.\\nLymphadenitis caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria \\nusually is unilateral in the cervical, submandibular, or pre -\\nauricular nodes and is more common in toddlers. The nodes \\nare relatively painless and firm initially, but gradually soften, \\nrupture, and drain over time. The local reaction is circumscribed, \\nand overlying skin may develop a violaceous discoloration \\nwithout warmth. Fever and systemic symptoms are minimal \\nor absent. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous in soil, \\nvegetation, dust, and water. Mycobacterium species commonly \\ncausing lymphadenitis in children includes M. avium complex, \\nM. scrofulaceum, and M. kansasii. M. tuberculosis uncommonly \\ncauses cervical lymphadenitis.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nInitial laboratory tests of regional lymphadenopathy include a \\ncomplete blood count and inflammatory markers. Infectious \\nmononucleosis is characterized by lymphocytosis with atypical \\nlymphocytes; thrombocytopenia and elevated hepatic enzymes \\nare common.\\nImportant findings include presence or absence of dental disease, \\noropharyngeal or skin lesions, ocular disease, other nodal \\nenlargement, and any other signs of systemic illness, including \\nhepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions.\\nAcute cervical lymphadenopathy associated with pharyngitis \\nis characterized by small and rubbery lymph nodes in the \\nanterior cervical chain with minimal to moderate tenderness. \\nSuppurative cervical lymphadenitis, frequently caused by S. \\naureus or group A streptococcus, shows erythema and warmth \\nof the overlying skin with moderate to exquisite tenderness.\\nEBV is the primary cause of infectious mononucleosis, a \\nclinical syndrome characterized by fever, fatigue and malaise, \\ncervical or generalized lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis, and \\npharyngitis.

Cultures \\nfor aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi \\nshould be performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nNoninfectious causes of cervical swelling and/or lymphade -\\nnopathy include congenital and acquired cysts, Kawasaki disease, \\nautoimmune diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis or Kikuchi-Fujimoto \\ndisease), benign neoplasms, and malignancies. The differential \\ndiagnosis for generalized lymphadenopathy includes juvenile \\nidiopathic arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; and serum \\nsickness and other adverse drug reactions, especially with \\nphenytoin and other antiepileptic medications, allopurinol, \\nisoniazid, antithyroid medications, and pyrimethamine. Leu-\\nkemia, lymphoma, and occasionally neuroblastoma may have \\nlymph nodes that are usually painless, uninflamed, matted, \\nand firm (see Chapters 155 and 156). A syndrome of periodic \\nfever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis is an \\noccasional cause of recurrent fever and cervical lymphadenitis \\n(see Chapter 103).\\nTREATMENT\\nManagement of lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis depends \\non patient age, associated findings, node size and location, and \\nseverity of the acute systemic symptoms. In children, most \\ncases of cervical lymphadenopathy, without other signs of acute \\ninflammation, require no specific therapy and usually regress \\nwithin 2-3 weeks. Progression to lymphadenitis or development \\nof generalized lymphadenopathy requires further evaluation.\\nThe specific treatment of cervical lymphadenitis depends on \\nthe underlying etiology. Empirical treatment targeting S. aureus \\nand group A streptococcus includes a penicillinase-resistant \\npenicillin (e.g., oxacillin) or first-generation cephalosporin \\n(e.g., cefazolin). For patients with hypersensitivity to β-lactam \\nantibiotics, or if community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. \\naureus is suspected, clindamycin is appropriate. Response to \\nempirical antibiotic therapy for suppurative cervical lymphad-\\nenitis obviates the need for further evaluation. Absence of a \\nclinical response within 48-72 hours is an indication for further \\nlaboratory evaluation and possible excisional biopsy and culture.\\nThere is no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis. \\nCat-scratch disease usually does not require treatment because \\nthe lymphadenopathy resolves in 2-4 months without sequelae. \\nAzithromycin may hasten resolution and reduces node size at \\n30 days, but no benefit is evident at 90 days. Aspiration and \\ndrainage are indicated for suppurative nodes. The recommended \\ntreatment of cervical lymphadenitis caused by nontuberculous \\nmycobacteria is complete surgical excision. Antimycobacterial \\ndrugs are necessary only if there is recurrence or inability to \\nexcise infected nodes completely, or if M. tuberculosis is identi-\\nfied, which requires 6 months of antituberculous chemotherapy \\n(see Chapter 124).\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nMost acute infections caused by S. aureus and group A strep-\\ntococcus respond to treatment and have an excellent prognosis. \\nComplications such as abscess formation, cellulitis, and bac-\\nteremia may occur. Abscess formation is treated with incision \\nand drainage in conjunction with appropriate antibiotic therapy.\\nCultures of infected skin lesions and tonsillar exudates \\nshould be obtained. Isolation of group A streptococci from \\nthe oropharynx suggests, but does not confirm, streptococcal \\ncervical lymphadenitis. A blood culture should be obtained \\nfrom children with systemic signs and symptoms of bacteremia.\\nSerological testing (or polymerase chain reaction) for EBV \\nand for B. henselae should be obtained if there are appropriate \\nfindings. The most reliable test for diagnosis of acute EBV infec-\\ntion is the IgM antiviral capsid antigen (Fig. 99.1). Heterophil \\nantibody is also diagnostic but is not reliably positive in children \\nyounger than 4 years with infectious mononucleosis.\\nExtended diagnostic work-up for lymphadenopathy is guided \\nby the specific risk factors in the history and physical examina-\\ntion findings. Chest radiograph, throat culture, antistreptolysin O \\ntiter, and serological tests for CMV , HIV , toxoplasmosis, syphilis, \\ntularemia, Brucella, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis may \\nbe indicated. Genital tract evaluation and specimens should be \\nobtained with regional inguinal lymphadenopathy (see Chapter \\n116). Screening for tuberculosis can be performed using the \\nstandard tuberculin skin test or an interferon-gamma release \\nassay; both may be positive with atypical mycobacterial infection.\\nAspiration is indicated for acutely inflamed, fluctuant cervical \\nlymph nodes, especially those larger than 3  cm in diameter \\nor not responding to antibiotic treatment. Ultrasound or \\ncomputed tomography may help in establishing the extent \\nof lymphadenopathy and defining whether the mass is solid, \\ncystic, or suppurative with abscess formation. Pus from fluctuant \\nlesions should be examined by Gram and acid-fast stains and \\ncultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. \\nBiopsy should be performed if lymphoma is suspected because \\nof firm, matted, nontender nodes and other systemic findings.\\nIf the diagnosis remains uncertain and lymphadenopathy \\npersists despite empirical antibiotic therapy for presumed S. \\naureus and group A streptococcus, excisional biopsy of the \\nentire node should be performed, if possible. This is curative \\nfor nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis. Biopsy \\nmaterial should be submitted for histopathology as well as \\nGram, acid-fast, Giemsa, periodic acid-Schiff, Warthin-Starry \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The bacteria causing \\nneonatal meningitis are the same as those causing neonatal \\nsepsis (see Chapter 65). In older children, S. pneumoniae and \\nN. meningitidis remain the most common causes of bacterial \\nmeningitis. Staphylococcal meningitis primarily occurs after \\nneurosurgery or penetrating head trauma.\\nPartially treated meningitis refers to bacterial meningitis \\ncomplicated by antibiotic treatment before the lumbar puncture \\n(LP), which may result in negative CSF cultures, although other \\nCSF findings suggestive of bacterial infection persist. In this \\ncase, the etiology can sometimes be confirmed by polymerase \\nchain reaction (PCR) of the CSF .\\nThe most common viruses causing meningitis are entero -\\nviruses and parechoviruses. Other viruses that can cause \\nmeningitis include herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr \\nvirus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), lymphocytic choriomen-\\ningitis virus (LCMV), many arboviruses (see Chapter 101), and \\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The mumps virus can \\ncause meningitis in unvaccinated children. Less frequent infec-\\ntious causes of meningitis include Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme \\ndisease), Bartonella henselae (cat-scratch disease), Mycobacterium \\ntuberculosis, Toxoplasma, fungi (Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, \\nBlastomycosis, and Coccidioides), and parasites (Angiostrongylus \\ncantonensis, Naegleria fowleri, and Acanthamoeba).\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe incidence of bacterial meningitis is highest among children \\nunder 1 year of age, especially infants <2 months. Extremely \\nhigh rates are found in Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, \\nand Australian aboriginals, suggesting that genetic factors play \\na role in susceptibility. Other risk factors include acquired  \\nor congenital immunodeficiencies, functional or anatomical \\nasplenia, cochlear implantation, penetrating head trauma, recent \\nneurosurgical procedure, and crowding, such as that which \\nInfectious mononucleosis usually resolves in 2-4 weeks, but \\nfatigue and malaise may wax and wane for several weeks to \\nmonths. EBV also is associated with numerous complications \\nduring the acute illness. Neurological complications include \\nseizures, aseptic meningitis syndrome, Bell palsy, transverse \\nmyelitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Hema-\\ntological complications include Coombs-positive hemolytic \\nanemia, antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, hemophagocytic \\nsyndrome, and, rarely, aplastic anemia. Corticosteroids have \\nbeen used for respiratory compromise resulting from tonsillar \\nhypertrophy, which responds rapidly, and for thrombocytopenia, \\nhemolytic anemia, and neurological complications. Splenic \\nrupture is very rare. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, \\nwhich results from a mutation of the SH2D1A gene located in the \\nXq25 region, manifests as fulminant infectious mononucleosis \\nwith primary EBV infection, and progresses to malignant \\nlymphoproliferative disease or dysgammaglobulinemia.\\nEBV infection, as with other herpesviruses, persists for life, \\nbut no symptoms are attributed to intermittent reactivation \\nin immunocompetent hosts. EBV is causally associated with \\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma; Burkitt lymphoma; Hodgkin disease; \\nleiomyosarcoma in immunocompromised persons; and EBV \\nlymphoproliferative disease, especially in posttransplant patients \\nand in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\\nLymphadenitis caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria has \\nan excellent prognosis. Surgical excision of cervical lymphad-\\nenitis caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria is curative in \\n>97% of cases.\\nPREVENTION\\nThe incidence of suppurative regional lymphadenitis reflects \\nthe incidence of predisposing conditions, such as dental disease, \\nstreptococcal pharyngitis, otitis media, impetigo, and other \\ninfections involving the face and scalp.

Seizures can be associated with central \\nnervous system (CNS) infection or can be the sequelae of brain \\nedema, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, or vasculitis.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment of bacterial meningitis focuses on sterilization of \\nthe CSF by antibiotics (Table 100.3) and maintenance of adequate \\ncerebral and systemic perfusion. Due to increasing S. pneumoniae \\nresistance, an empiric third-generation cephalosporin plus \\nvancomycin should be administered until culture results and \\nantibiotic susceptibility testing are available. Cefotaxime or \\nceftriaxone are also adequate to treat N. meningitidis , H. \\ninfluenzae, and some E. coli. For infants younger than 2 months \\nof age, ampicillin is added to cover the possibility of Listeria \\nmonocytogenes. Duration of treatment is 5-7 days for N. \\nmeningitidis, 7-10 days for H. influenzae, and 10-14 days for \\nS. pneumoniae.

Morbidity and mortality \\nare highest with S. pneumoniae. Of survivors, up to 30% have \\nsequelae, including deafness, seizures, blindness, paresis, ataxia, \\nor hydrocephalus. All patients with meningitis should have a \\nhearing evaluation before discharge and at follow-up.

Numerous other infectious \\netiologies for encephalitis are possible in the appropriate setting, \\nincluding prion-diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and \\nparasites such as amoeba, Bartonella henselae, Mycobacterium \\ntuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Mycoplasma pneu -\\nmoniae. Encephalitis also may result from metabolic, toxic, and \\nneoplastic disorders. In many cases, the cause remains unknown.\\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)  is the \\nabrupt development of multiple neurological signs related to \\nan inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the brain and spinal \\ncord. ADEM can follow childhood viral infections (such as \\nmeasles and chickenpox) or vaccinations, and can clinically \\nresemble multiple sclerosis.\\nAutoimmune encephalitis is a relatively common cause \\nof encephalitis and is associated with specific autoantibodies \\ndirected to brain antigens, such as anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate \\nreceptor antibodies. The presentation is often subacute with \\npsychological manifestations, cortical dysfunction, movement \\ndisorders, autonomic dysfunction, and seizures.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nArboviral and enteroviral encephalitides characteristically appear \\nin clusters or epidemics that occur from midsummer to early \\nfall, although sporadic cases of enteroviral encephalitis occur \\nthroughout the year. Herpesviruses and other infectious agents \\naccount for additional sporadic cases throughout the year.\\nArboviruses tend to be limited to certain geographic areas, \\nreflecting the reservoir and mosquito vector. In North America, \\nWest Nile virus and La Crosse encephalitis occur in the summer \\ntime, resulting in a range of manifestations from asymptomatic \\ninfection to severe neurological involvement. La Crosse virus is \\nfound in the Midwest and southeastern United States, whereas \\nWest Nile virus is more disseminated across the country. The \\nprincipal vectors for West Nile virus are Culex mosquitoes, and \\na broad range of birds serves as its major reservoir.\\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis can occur in \\nneonates with or without skin lesions via perinatal or postnatal \\ntransmission. Beyond the neonatal period, HSV encephalitis \\ncan result from primary or recurrent infection with HSV type \\n1. In the immunocompromised host, other herpes viruses, such \\nas cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human \\nherpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), as \\nwell as Toxoplasma gondii and JC viruses can reactivate and \\ncause encephalitis. Fungal infections of the CNS are rare but \\ncan also cause disease in this patient population.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nazithromycin, or ceftriaxone to eradicate the carrier state and \\ndecrease transmission is recommended both for index cases \\nwith N. meningitidis and for their close contacts. For invasive \\nH. influenzae type B, prophylaxis consists of rifampin.\\nCHAPTER 101 \\nEncephalitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nEncephalitis is an inflammatory process of the brain paren -\\nchyma, which usually presents with fever, headache, and mental \\nstatus changes. Encephalitis is a challenging diagnosis in many \\naspects, as determining its etiology is difficult and treatment \\noptions are quite limited. The term meningoencephalitis is \\nused when meningeal inflammation is also present. Encephalitis \\nis usually an acute infectious process, but also may be a \\npostinfectious, autoimmune, part of a systemic disorder (lupus), \\nor the result of an indolent viral infection. Encephalitis may \\nbe diffuse or localized. Organisms cause encephalitis by one \\nof two mechanisms: (1) direct infection of the brain parenchyma \\nvia an extension of meningitis, secondary to viremia, or ret-\\nrograde spread via peripheral nerves or (2) a postinfectious, \\nimmune-mediated response in the CNS that usually begins \\nseveral days to weeks after clinical manifestations of the \\ninfection.\\nViruses are the principal infectious causes of acute infectious \\nencephalitis (Table 101.1). The most common viral causes of \\nencephalitis in the United States are enteroviruses, arboviruses, \\nand herpesviruses. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is \\nalso an important cause of subacute encephalitis in children \\nand adolescents and may present as an acute febrile illness \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nStiff or Painful Neck\\nHeadaches\\nAtaxia\\nAltered Mental Status\\nHearing Loss Query\\nPolyuria\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Even with extensive testing and the use \\nof PCR assays, the cause of encephalitis remains undetermined \\nin one third of cases. Both blood and CSF should be sent to \\ndetect brain-specific antibodies present in ~95% of patients \\nwith autoimmune encephalitis.\\nBrain biopsy is seldom performed and is generally recom -\\nmended only if the etiology remains unknown and a patient \\ncontinues to deteriorate. Rabies encephalitis and prion-related \\ndiseases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru) may be routinely \\ndiagnosed by culture or pathological examination of brain \\nbiopsy tissue. Brain tissue can be sent for pathology, culture, \\nand PCR testing and may be helpful to identify arbovirus and \\nenterovirus infections, tuberculosis, fungal infections, and \\nnoninfectious illnesses, particularly primary CNS vasculopathies \\nand malignancies.\\nTREATMENT\\nWith the exception of HSV , VZV , CMV , HHV-6, and HIV , there \\nis no specific therapy for viral encephalitis.

CMV disease is treated with ganciclovir. HHV-6 \\nencephalitis in patients who are post–bone marrow transplant \\ncan also be treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet.

Autoimmune encephalitis has \\nbeen treated with steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), \\nand rituximab.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nAmong survivors, symptoms usually resolve over several days \\nto 2-3 weeks. Although most patients with epidemic forms of \\ninfectious encephalitis (St. Louis, California, West Nile, and \\nenterovirus infections) in the United States recover without \\nsequelae, severe cases leading to death or substantial neurological \\nsequelae can occur with virtually any of these neurotropic \\nviruses. Sequelae can include paresis or spasticity, cognitive \\nimpairment, weakness, ataxia, and recurrent seizures. Most \\npatients gradually recover some or all of their function. The \\noverall mortality for infectious encephalitis is low, depending \\non the etiology.\\nDisease caused by HSV , Eastern equine encephalitis, or M. \\npneumoniae is associated with a worse prognosis, especially \\nin children younger than 1 year of age or with coma. Rabies, \\nwith very rare exceptions, is fatal.\\nAcute infectious encephalitis may be preceded by a prodrome \\nof several days of nonspecific symptoms, such as sore throat, \\nfever, headache, and abdominal complaints followed by the \\ncharacteristic symptoms of progressive lethargy, behavioral \\nchanges, and neurological deficits. Seizures are common at \\npresentation. Children with encephalitis also may have a maculo-\\npapular rash and severe complications, such as fulminant coma, \\ntransverse myelitis, anterior horn cell disease, or peripheral  \\nneuropathy.\\nNeonates with HSV encephalitis can present with fever, \\nlethargy, and/or seizures. Vesicular skin lesions typical of \\ncutaneous infection may or may not be present.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis is established presumptively by the presence of \\ncharacteristic neurological signs, typical epidemiological find-\\nings, and evidence of infection by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \\nanalysis, electroencephalogram (EEG), and brain imaging \\ntechniques. Encephalitis may result from infections with bacteria, \\nMycoplasma, Rickettsia, fungi, and parasites, and from many \\nnoninfectious diseases, including metabolic diseases (encepha-\\nlopathy), such as Reye syndrome, hypoglycemia, collagen \\nvascular disorders, drugs, hypertension, and malignancies.\\nElucidating a careful history, including immunization \\nrecord, travel, and geographic and social risk factors, may \\nhelp to establish the etiology of encephalitis in a patient. If the \\npatient is known to be or found to be immunocompromised, \\nthe differential diagnosis must be broadened accordingly.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe diagnosis of viral encephalitis is supported by examination \\nof the CSF , which typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, \\na slight elevation in protein content, and a normal glucose \\nlevel. The CSF occasionally may be normal. Extreme eleva -\\ntions of protein and reductions of glucose suggest tuberculosis, \\ncryptococcal infection, or meningeal carcinomatosis. Blood \\ncan be sent for a complete blood count with differential \\nand culture, as well as liver function tests and infectious  \\nserologies.\\nNeuroimaging studies are often required prior to a lumbar \\npuncture (LP) in these children as they generally have altered \\nmental status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally \\nthe study of choice in the diagnosis of encephalitis; however, \\ncomputed tomography (CT) may be used to exclude contrain-\\ndications to LP or if MRI is unavailable. Brain imaging may be \\nnormal or may show diffuse cerebral swelling of the parenchyma \\nor focal abnormalities. EEG can show diffuse, slow wave activity, \\nalthough focal changes may be present. A temporal lobe focus \\non EEG or brain imaging is a characteristic feature of HSV \\ninfection.\\nSerum and CSF testing may help determine an infectious \\netiology for encephalitis. Depending on the risk factors, sero -\\nlogical studies should be obtained for arboviruses (including \\nWest Nile virus, if indicated by the patient risk factors), HIV , \\nEBV , M. pneumoniae, B. henselae, and Lyme disease.

URIs are the most \\ncommon cause of human disease and are often a cause of missed \\nwork or school, as well as visits to primary care pediatricians. \\nY oung children are at highest risk for frequent URI due to their \\nlack of immunity from previous infection and close contact \\nwith others who frequently shed virus.\\nThe viruses most commonly associated with colds are \\nrhinoviruses. Other viruses that cause URIs include respiratory \\nsyncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses, \\ncoxsackieviruses, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses. \\nViral infection of nasal epithelium causes an acute inflammatory \\nresponse with mucosal infiltration by inflammatory cells and \\nrelease of cytokines. The host inflammatory response is partly \\nresponsible for many of the symptoms.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nURIs occur throughout the year with peak incidence from fall \\nthrough late spring, reflecting the seasonal prevalence of viral \\npathogens and confined habitation during colder months. Y oung \\nchildren have an average of seven to eight viral infections each \\nyear. The number decreases with age, to two to three colds \\neach year by adulthood. Children in out-of-home day care \\nduring the first year of life have 50% more URIs than children \\ncared for at home only. With preschool attendance, it is not \\nunusual for children to experience one infection/month of the \\nrespiratory virus season. This difference diminishes during \\nsubsequent years in day care.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nRhinorrhea\\nSore Throat\\nURI symptoms typically develop 1-3 days after viral infection \\nand include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore or scratchy throat, \\nand occasional nonproductive cough. Fever, although uncom-\\nmon in adults, may occur in infants and young children. \\nSymptoms usually persist for approximately 5-7 days, although \\nit can be longer in preschool aged children. Constitutional \\nsymptoms such as fever, myalgia, and headaches generally are \\npresent only early in the illness. Respiratory symptoms tend \\nto persist for the duration of the illness. There is often a change \\nin the color or consistency of nasal secretions, which is not \\nnecessarily indicative of sinusitis or bacterial superinfection. \\nExamination of the nasal mucosa may reveal swollen, \\nerythematous nasal turbinates.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nLaboratory studies often are not helpful. A nasopharyngeal \\nswab for respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction is some-\\ntimes obtained in the inpatient setting in immunocompromised \\npatients or for infection prevention reasons. A nasal smear for \\neosinophils may be useful in the evaluation for allergic rhinitis \\n(see Chapter 79).\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of URI includes allergic rhinitis, \\nforeign body (especially with unilateral nasal discharge), \\nsinusitis, pertussis, and pharyngitis. Allergic rhinitis is character-\\nized by absence of fever, eosinophils in the nasal discharge, \\nand other manifestations, such as allergic shiners, nasal polyps, \\na transverse crease on the nasal bridge, and pale, edematous, \\nnasal turbinate mucosa. Other, rare causes of chronic rhinorrhea \\nare choanal atresia or stenosis, cerebrospinal fluid fistula, \\ndiphtheria, tumor, congenital syphilis (with snuffles), nasopha-\\nryngeal malignancy, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\\nTREATMENT\\nThere is no specific therapy for URIs. Antibacterial therapy is \\nnot beneficial and instead may cause harm. Management consists \\nof symptomatic therapies. Antihistamines and decongestants \\nare not recommended for children younger than 6 years of age \\nbecause of adverse effects and lack of benefits. Similarly, cough \\nsuppressants and expectorants have not been shown to be \\nbeneficial. Vitamin C and inhalation of warm, humidified air \\nare no more effective than placebo. The benefit of zinc lozenges \\nor sprays has been inconsistent.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nOtitis media is the most common complication and occurs in \\nabout 5% of children with a URI (see Chapter 105).

Group A streptococcus  \\n(Streptococcus pyogenes) is the most common important bacterial \\ncause of pharyngitis. Other bacterial organisms less often \\nassociated with pharyngitis include groups C and G streptococci \\n(also β-hemolytic) and rarely Arcanobacterium haemolyticum \\n(β-hemolytic, gram-positive rod) and Francisella tularensis \\n(gram-negative coccobacillus and cause of tularemia). Chla-\\nmydophila pneumonia is associated with lower respiratory disease \\nbut can also cause sore throat. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is \\nassociated with atypical pneumonia and may cause mild \\npharyngitis without distinguishing clinical manifestations. \\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae should be considered in a sexually active \\nadolescent or adult with pharyngitis. Other bacteria, including \\nStaphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and S. pneu-\\nmoniae, are cultured frequently from the throats of children, \\nbut their role in causing pharyngitis is unclear.\\nMany viruses cause acute pharyngitis. Some viruses, such as \\nadenoviruses, are more likely than others to cause pharyngitis \\nas a prominent symptom, whereas other viruses, such as rhi-\\nnoviruses, are more likely to cause pharyngitis as a minor part \\nof an illness that primarily features other symptoms, such as \\nrhinorrhea or cough. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), enteroviruses \\n(herpangina), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and primary human \\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can also produce \\npharyngitis.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nSore throat is the primary symptom in approximately one third \\nof upper respiratory tract illnesses. Streptococcal pharyngitis \\nis relatively uncommon before 2-3 years of age, but the incidence \\nincreases in young school-age children and then declines in \\nlate adolescence and adulthood. Streptococcal pharyngitis occurs \\nthroughout the year in temperate climates. The illness often \\nspreads to siblings and classmates. Viral infections generally \\nspread via close contact with an infected person and peak during \\nwinter and spring. EBV or cytomegalovirus related mononucleo-\\nsis (see Chapter 99) can feature pharyngitis as a prominent \\nsymptom and is most common in adolescents and young adults.\\nTABLE 103.1 Major Microbial Causes of Acute Pharyngitis\\nAGENT\\nSYNDROME OR \\nDISEASE\\nESTIMATED \\nPROPORTION OF \\nALL PHARYNGITIS \\n(%)\\nBACTERIAL\\nGroup A \\nstreptococcus \\n(Streptococcus \\npyogenes)\\nPharyngitis, \\ntonsillitis, scarlet \\nfever\\n15-30\\nGroup C and G \\nstreptococcus\\nPharyngitis, \\ntonsillitis\\n1-5\\nArcanobacterium \\nhaemolyticum\\nPharyngitis (Scarlet \\nfever-like syndrome)\\n0.5-3\\nFusobacterium \\nnecrophorum\\nLemierre syndrome Unknown\\nMycoplasma \\npneumoniae\\nPharyngitis, \\npneumonia\\nUnknown\\nOther (e.g., Neisseria \\ngonorrhoeae, \\nCorynebacterium \\ndiphtheriae, \\nFrancisella tularensis)\\nPharyngitis, \\nlaryngitis, tularemia\\n<5\\nVIRAL\\nRhinoviruses (>100 \\ntypes)\\nURI 20\\nCoronaviruses (>4 \\ntypes)\\nURI >5\\nAdenoviruses (types \\n3, 4, 7, 14, 21)\\nPharyngoconjunctival \\nfever, acute \\nrespiratory disease\\n5\\nHerpes simplex \\nviruses (types 1 and \\n2)\\nGingivitis, \\nstomatitis, \\npharyngitis\\n4\\nParainfluenza viruses \\n(types 1-4)\\nURI, croup 2\\nInfluenza viruses \\n(types A and B)\\nInfluenza 2\\nEpstein-Barr virus Mononucleosis Unknown\\nCytomegalovirus Mononucleosis Unknown\\nCoxsackie virus Herpangina, hand, \\nfoot and mouth \\ndisease\\nUnknown\\nUNKNOWN 40\\nURI, Upper respiratory tract infection.\\nModified from Hayden GF, Hendley JO, Gwaltney JM Jr. Management of the \\nambulatory patient with a sore throat.

If involvement of the tonsils is prominent, the term \\ntonsillitis or tonsillopharyngitis is often used.\\nThe onset of streptococcal pharyngitis is often rapid and \\nassociated with prominent sore throat and moderate to high \\nfever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are \\nfrequent. In a typical, florid case, the pharynx is distinctly red. \\nThe tonsils are enlarged and may be covered with a yellow, \\nblood-tinged exudate. There may be petechiae on the soft palate \\nand posterior pharynx and the uvula may be red, stippled, \\nand swollen. Anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and \\ntender to touch. However, some children present with only \\nmild pharyngeal erythema without tonsillar exudate or cervical \\nlymphadenitis. Compared with classic streptococcal pharyngitis, \\nthe onset of viral pharyngitis is typically more gradual, and \\nsymptoms more often include rhinorrhea, cough, and diarrhea. \\nConjunctivitis, coryza, or oral ulcerations also suggest a viral \\netiology. The diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis cannot be \\nmade on clinical features alone.\\nIn addition to sore throat and fever, some patients with \\nstreptococcal pharyngitis exhibit the stigmata of scarlet \\nfever: circumoral pallor, strawberry tongue, and a fine diffuse \\nerythematous macular-papular rash. The tongue initially has \\na white coating, but red and edematous lingual papillae later \\nproject through this coating, producing a white strawberry \\ntongue. When the white coating peels off, the resulting red \\nstrawberry tongue is beefy red with prominent papillae. Patients \\ninfected with A. haemolyticum may present with similar findings.\\nGingivostomatitis is characteristic of HSV type 1. Herpan-\\ngina is an enteroviral infection with sudden onset of high fever, \\nvomiting, headache, malaise, myalgia, poor intake, drooling, sore \\nthroat, and dysphagia. The oral lesions of herpangina may be \\nnonspecific, but classically there are one or more small, tender, \\npapular, or pinpoint vesicular lesions on an erythematous base \\nscattered over the soft palate, uvula, and tongue. These vesicles \\nenlarge from 1 to 4  mm o ver 3-4 days, rupture, and produce \\nsmall, punched-out ulcers that persist for several days. Similar \\nlesions may have been seen in hand, foot, and mouth disease \\ncaused by coxsackieviruses.\\nLABORATORY EVALUATION\\nThe principal challenge is to distinguish pharyngitis caused by \\ngroup A streptococcus from pharyngitis caused by viral organ-\\nisms. A rapid streptococcal antigen test, a throat culture, or \\nboth should be performed to improve diagnostic precision and \\nto identify children most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. \\nAntigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for streptococcal phar-\\nyngitis have excellent specificity of 95-99%. However, the \\nsensitivity of these rapid tests varies, and negative rapid tests \\nshould be confirmed by a throat culture. Throat culture or \\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the definitive diagnostic \\ntests to establish the presence of streptococcal pharyngitis. \\nHowever, as many as 20% of positive cultures in children during \\nwinter months represent chronic streptococcal carriage and \\nnot acute pharyngitis.\\nThe predictive values of white blood cell count, erythrocyte \\nsedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein are not sufficient to \\ndistinguish streptococcal from nonstreptococcal pharyngitis, \\nand these tests are not routinely recommended. The white blood \\ncell count in patients with infectious mononucleosis usually \\nshows a predominance of atypical lymphocytes.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLymphadenopathy\\nThe differential diagnosis of infectious pharyngitis includes \\nother local infections of the oral cavity, retropharyngeal abscesses \\n(S. aureus, streptococci, anaerobes), diphtheria (if unimmu-\\nnized), peritonsillar abscesses (streptococci, anaerobes, or, rarely, \\nS. aureus), and epiglottitis. In addition, neutropenic mucositis \\n(leukemia, aplastic anemia), thrush (candidiasis secondary to \\nT-cell immune deficiency), autoimmune ulceration (systemic \\nlupus erythematosus, Behçet disease), and Kawasaki disease \\nmay cause pharyngitis. Pharyngitis can be a feature of the acute \\nretrovirus syndrome associated with primary HIV infection \\n(see Chapter 125).\\nVincent angina or trench mouth refers to a virulent \\nform of anaerobic gingivitis and pharyngitis; gray pseudo -\\nmembranes are found on the tonsils. Lemierre syndrome is \\nacute pharyngitis complicated by thrombosis of the internal \\njugular vein and septic pulmonary emboli. It primarily occurs \\nin adolescents and is caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. \\nLudwig angina is a mixed anaerobic bacterial cellulitis of the \\nsubmandibular and sublingual regions. It is typically due to \\nspreading from an abscess of the second or third mandibular \\nmolar. It also has been associated with tongue piercing. A \\npropensity for rapid spread, glottic and lingual swelling, and \\nconsequent airway obstruction makes prompt intervention  \\nimperative.\\nA syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyn-\\ngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAP A) is a rare cause of recurrent \\nfever in children. The fevers begin at a young age (usually <5 \\nyears). Episodes last approximately 5 days, with a mean of 28 \\ndays between episodes. Episodes are shorter with oral prednisone \\nand do not respond to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or \\nantibiotics. Long-term sequelae do not develop.\\nTREATMENT\\nEven if untreated, most episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis \\nresolve uneventfully over a few days. Early antimicrobial therapy \\naccelerates clinical recovery by 24-48 hours. The major benefit \\nof antimicrobial therapy is the prevention of acute rheumatic \\nfever (see Chapter 146). Because the latent (incubation) period \\nof acute rheumatic fever is relatively long (1-3 weeks), treatment \\ninstituted within 9 days of illness onset is virtually 100% suc-\\ncessful in preventing rheumatic fever. Treatment begun after \\nthis period, although less than 100% successful, has some \\npreventive value. Therefore antibiotic therapy should be started \\npromptly in children with a positive rapid test or throat culture \\n(or PCR) for group A streptococcus or a diagnosis of scarlet \\nfever. In addition, a child who has symptomatic pharyngitis \\nand a history of rheumatic fever, or a recent family history of \\nrheumatic fever, or whose sibling has documented streptococcal \\ninfection should be treated.\\nA variety of antimicrobial agents can be used to treat strep-\\ntococcal pharyngitis (Table 103.2).

Only the maxillary and \\nethmoid sinuses are present at birth, whereas the sphenoid \\nsinuses are present by 5 years of age. Frontal sinuses begin to \\ndevelop at 7 years of age and are not completely developed \\nuntil adolescence. The ostia draining the sinuses are narrow \\n(1-3 mm) a nd drain into the middle meatus in the ostiomeatal \\ncomplex. The mucociliary system maintains the sinuses as \\nnormally sterile. Indwelling nasogastric and nasotracheal tubes \\npredispose to nosocomial sinusitis.\\nObstruction to mucociliary flow, such as mucosal edema \\nresulting from a URI, impedes sinus drainage and predisposes to \\nbacterial proliferation. The bacterial causes of most cases of acute \\nsinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypable Haemophilus \\ninfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus  \\nand anaerobes emerge as important pathogens in subacute and \\nchronic sinusitis.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe true incidence of sinusitis is unknown. In addition to \\npredisposing URI, other risk factors include allergic rhinitis, \\ncystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV) infection, nasogastric or nasotracheal intubation, \\nprimary ciliary dyskinesia, nasal polyps, and nasal foreign  \\nbody.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nremain first-line therapy. Ten days of treatment is recommended \\nto prevent rheumatic fever. Intramuscular penicillin G can be \\nused for children who cannot tolerate oral therapy. Cephalo-\\nsporins have superior pharyngeal bacterial eradication rates \\ncompared to penicillin; however, they are only recommended \\nas an alternative option. Five days of azithromycin is also an \\nalternate treatment option for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, \\nalthough rates of resistance to azithromycin are higher than \\nthose to penicillins. Test of cure for patients who respond \\nclinically to treatment is not required. Children with recurrent \\nepisodes of group A streptococcal pharyngitis pose a particular \\nproblem. True treatment failure is rare. Recurrent infection \\nmay represent nonadherence, chronic streptococcal carriage \\nin the setting of a viral pharyngitis, or reinfection. A second \\ncourse of treatment can be administered. Amoxicillin-clavulanate \\nor clindamycin can be effective for eliminating streptococcal  \\ncarriage.\\nSpecific antiviral therapy is unavailable for most cases of viral \\npharyngitis. Patients with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis \\nbenefit from early treatment with oral acyclovir.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nPharyngitis caused by streptococci or respiratory viruses usually \\nresolves completely. The complications of group A streptococcal \\npharyngitis include local suppurative complications, such as \\nparapharyngeal abscess and other infections of the deep fascial \\nspaces of the neck, and nonsuppurative complications, such as \\nacute rheumatic fever and acute postinfectious glomerulone-\\nphritis. Viral upper respiratory tract infections, including \\ninfections caused by influenza A, adenoviruses, parainfluenza \\ntype 3, and rhinoviruses, may predispose the patient to bacterial \\nmiddle ear infections.\\nPREVENTION\\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis with daily oral penicillin V prevents \\nrecurrent streptococcal infections and is recommended to \\nprevent recurrences of rheumatic fever in at-risk patients.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nRhinorrhea\\nCough\\nVomiting\\nHeadaches\\nTABLE 103.2 Antimicrobial Treatment of Group A \\nStreptococcal Pharyngitis\\nOral penicillin V (2-3 times daily for 10 days) 250-500  mg/dose\\nIntramuscular benzathine penicillin G (single dose)―For children \\n≤27 kg: 600,000 U; For larger children and adults: 1.2 million U\\nFor persons allergic to penicillin\\nCephalexin 25 mg/kg/dose BID, maximum dose 500  mg/dose × \\n10 days\\nClindamycin 7 mg/kg/dose TID, maximum dose 300  mg/dose × \\n10 days\\nFor persons allergic to β-lactams\\nAzithromycin, children: 12 mg/kg (maximum: 500  mg/dose) on day \\n1 followed by 6  mg/kg/dose (maximum: 250 mg/dose) OD on \\ndays 2 through 5\\nBID, Twice daily; OD, once daily; TID, three times daily.\\nThe most common presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis is \\npersistent rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and cough, especially \\nat night.

Bacteria gain access to the middle ear when the \\nnormal patency of the eustachian tube is blocked by upper \\nairway infection or hypertrophied adenoids. Air trapped in \\nthe middle ear is resorbed, creating negative pressure in this \\ncavity and facilitating reflux of nasopharyngeal bacteria.\\nBacteria are the most common pathogens in OM, most \\nfrequently as a co-infection with viruses. Viruses can be the \\nsole pathogen in OM, but this is less common (<20%). The \\ncommon bacterial pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, \\nnontypable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and, \\nless frequently, group A streptococcus. S. pneumoniae that is \\nrelatively resistant to penicillin (minimal inhibitory concen -\\ntration 2-8 µg/mL) or highly resistant to penicillin (minimal \\ninhibitory concentration ≥8 µg/mL) is isolated with increasing \\nfrequency from young children, particularly those who attend \\nday care or have recently received antibiotics.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nDiseases of the middle ear account for approximately one third \\nof office visits to pediatricians. The peak incidence of acute \\notitis media (AOM) is between 6 and 15 months of life. By the \\nsecond birthday, 90% of children will have experienced at least \\none episode of symptomatic or asymptomatic OM. OM is more \\ncommon in younger children, children exposed to young \\nchildren, and those with a positive family history. In most of \\nthe United States, OM is a seasonal disease with a distinct peak \\nin late winter/early spring, which corresponds to the rhinovirus, \\nrespiratory syncytial virus, and influenza seasons.\\nApproximately 10% of children in the general population \\nhave recurrent OM, as defined by the presence of three or \\nmore AOM episodes in the preceding 6 months or four or more \\nepisodes in the preceding 12 months, with at least one episode \\nin the past 6 months, and would be considered otitis prone. \\nCraniofacial anomalies (cleft palate) and immunodeficiencies \\noften are associated with recurrent OM, although most children \\nwith recurrent AOM are otherwise healthy.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nCulture of the nasal mucosa is not useful. Sinus aspirate culture \\nis the most accurate method of determining etiology but is not \\npractical or necessary in immunocompetent patients.\\nRoutine imaging is not recommended in uncomplicated \\ninfections. Plain x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal sinus cloud-\\ning, mucosal thickening, or air-fluid levels in the sinuses. \\nHowever, abnormal radiographic findings do not differentiate \\ninfection from allergic disease and often show abnormalities \\nin the sinuses of children with a simple viral URI. Conversely, \\nnormal imaging can have a high negative predictive value for \\nbacterial sinusitis. Bony erosion may be seen on imaging studies \\nin immunocompromised hosts.\\nTREATMENT\\nAmoxicillin for 10-14 days can be used as first-line therapy of \\nuncomplicated sinusitis in children. Broadening therapy to \\namoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate if there is no clinical \\nresponse to amoxicillin within 2-3 days, if risk factors for \\nresistant organisms are present (antibiotic treatment in the \\npreceding 1-3 months, day care attendance, age <2 years), if \\nthere is chronic sinusitis, or if any amount of eye swelling is \\npresent.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nComplications of bacterial sinusitis include orbital cellulitis, \\nepidural or subdural empyema, brain abscess, dural sinus \\nthrombosis, osteomyelitis of the frontal sinus (Pott puffy tumor), \\nand meningitis. These all should be managed with sinus drainage \\nand broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics. Sinusitis also may \\nexacerbate bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma.\\nOrbital (postseptal) cellulitis is a serious complication of \\nsinusitis that follows bacterial spread into the orbit through the \\nwall of the infected sinus. It typically begins as ethmoid sinusitis \\nand spreads through the lamina papyracea, a thin, bony plate \\nthat separates the medial orbit and the ethmoid sinus. Orbital \\ninvolvement can lead to subperiosteal abscess, cavernous sinus \\nthrombosis, and vision loss. Clinical manifestations of orbital \\ncellulitis include a swollen edematous eye, eye pain, propto-\\nsis, chemosis, and limitations in extraocular muscle motion, \\ndiplopia, and reduced visual acuity. Infection of the orbit must \\nbe differentiated from that of the preseptal (anterior to the \\npalpebral fascia) or periorbital space. Preseptal (periorbital) \\ncellulitis is most common in young children; these patients \\ndo not have proptosis or ophthalmoplegia. Preseptal cellulitis \\nmay be associated with a skin lesion or trauma and usually is \\ncaused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus.\\nThe diagnosis of orbital cellulitis is confirmed by a CT \\nscan of the orbit, which helps determine the extent of orbital \\ninfection and the need for surgical drainage. Therapy for orbital \\ncellulitis involves broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics, such \\nas vancomycin and ceftriaxone.\\nPREVENTION\\nThe best means of prevention are good handwashing to  \\nminimize acquisition of URIs and management of allergic \\nrhinitis.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nEar Pain\\nStrabismus\\nAbnormal Eye Movements\\nDiarrhea\\nHearing Loss\\nFever without a Source\\nIn infants, the most frequent symptoms of AOM are nonspecific \\nand include fever, irritability, and poor feeding.

AOM also may present with otorrhea \\n(ear drainage) after spontaneous rupture of the tympanic \\nmembrane. Signs of a common cold, which predisposes to \\nAOM, are often present (see Chapter 102). A bulging tympanic \\nmembrane, air fluid level, or visualization of purulent material \\nby otoscopy are reliable signs of infection (Table 105.1).\\nExamination of the ears is essential for diagnosis and should \\nbe part of the physical examination of any child with fever. The \\nhallmark of OM is the presence of effusion in the middle ear \\ncavity (see Table 105.1). The presence of an effusion does not \\nconfirm the presence of a bacterial OM, but it does define the \\nneed for appropriate diagnosis and therapy.\\nPneumatic otoscopy, using an attachment to an otoscope, \\nallows evaluation of ventilation of the middle ear and is a \\nstandard for clinical diagnosis. The tympanic membrane of \\nthe normal, air-filled middle ear has much greater compliance \\nthan if the middle ear is fluid-filled. With AOM, the tympanic \\nmembrane is often characterized by hyperemia, or red color \\nrather than the normal pearly gray color, but may appear pink, \\nwhite, or yellow depending on the degree of bulging (Fig. \\n105.1). The light reflex is lost, and the middle ear structures \\nare obscured and difficult to distinguish. There should be poor \\nor absent mobility to negative and positive pressure; this is \\na necessary finding for the diagnosis of OM. A hole in the \\ntympanic membrane or purulent drainage confirms perforation. \\nOccasionally bullae are present on the lateral aspect of the \\ntympanic membrane, which characteristically are associated \\nwith severe ear pain.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nRoutine laboratory studies, including complete blood count \\nand erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are not useful in the evalu-\\nation of OM. Tympanometry provides objective acoustic \\nmeasurements of the tympanic membrane–middle ear system \\nby reflection or absorption of sound energy from the external \\near duct as pressure in the duct is varied. Measurements of the \\nresulting tympanogram correlate well with the presence or \\nabsence of middle ear effusion.\\nInstruments using acoustic reflectometry are available for \\noffice use. Use of reflectometry as a screening test for AOM \\nshould be followed by examination with pneumatic otoscopy \\nwhen abnormal reflectometry is identified.\\nBacteria recovered from the nasopharynx do not correlate \\nwith bacteria isolated by tympanocentesis. Tympanocentesis and \\nmiddle ear exudate culture are not always necessary, but they \\nare required for accurate identification of bacterial pathogens \\nand may be useful in neonates, immunocompromised patients, \\nand patients not responding to therapy.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe major difficulty is differentiation of AOM from OM with \\neffusion (OME), which also is referred to as chronic OM. \\nAOM is accompanied by signs of acute illness, such as fever, \\npain, and upper respiratory tract inflammation. OME is the \\npresence of effusion without any of the other signs and symp-\\ntoms. OME may occur either as the sequel of AOM or eustachian \\ntube dysfunction secondary to an upper respiratory tract \\ninfection. It may also predispose to the development of AOM. \\nBecause OME is not an acute infectious process, it is important \\nto be able to differentiate between OME and AOM accurately \\nto prevent overprescribing of antibiotics.\\nTREATMENT\\nRecommendations for treatment are based on age, certainty \\nof diagnosis, and severity of illness (Table 105.2). The recom-\\nmended first-line therapy for most children meeting criteria \\nfor antibiotic therapy is amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg/day in two \\ndivided doses).

Evaluating young children for this \\ncondition is an important part of all well-child examinations \\nbecause, although not an infectious process, it is associated \\nwith hearing loss.\\nConductive hearing loss should be assumed to be present with \\npersistent middle ear effusion; the loss is mild to moderate and \\noften is transient or fluctuating. In children at developmental \\nrisk or with frequent episodes of recurrent AOM, 3 months \\nof persistent effusion with significant bilateral hearing loss is \\na reasonable indicator of need for intervention with insertion \\nof pressure equalization tubes.\\nPREVENTION\\nParents should be encouraged to continue exclusive breast \\nfeeding as long as possible and should be cautioned about the \\nrisks of bottle-propping and of children taking a bottle to bed. \\nThe home should be a smoke-free environment, and pacifier \\nuse should be limited.\\nThe conjugate S. pneumoniae vaccine reduces pneumococcal \\nOM caused by vaccine serotypes by 50%, all pneumococcal OM \\nby 33%, and all OM by 6-10%.

The most common bacterial pathogens are Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa, especially in association with swimming in pools \\nor lakes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Otitis externa develops in \\napproximately 20% of children with tympanostomy tubes, \\nassociated with S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella \\ncatarrhalis, Proteus, Klebsiella, and occasionally anaerobes. \\ndiagnosis may be observed if appropriate follow-up within \\n48-72 hours can be arranged with initiation of antibiotic therapy \\nif symptoms do not self-resolve (Table 105.2). The failure of \\ninitial therapy with amoxicillin at 3 days suggests infection \\nwith β-lactamase-producing H. influenza, M. catarrhalis, or \\nresistant S. pneumoniae. Recommended next-step treatments \\ninclude high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxicillin 80-90 m g/\\nkg/day), cefdinir, or ceftriaxone (50 m g/kg intramuscularly in \\ndaily doses for 3 days). Intramuscular ceftriaxone is especially \\nappropriate for children with vomiting that precludes oral \\ntreatment. Tympanocentesis may be required for patients who \\nare difficult to treat or who do not respond to therapy. Acet-\\naminophen and ibuprofen are recommended for fever. Decon-\\ngestants or antihistamines are not effective.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nA B C\\nFIGURE 105.1 Appearance of tympanic membrane in acute otitis media.

These preparations are equally \\neffective and are active against S. aureus and most gram-negative \\nbacteria, including P . aeruginosa. None of these antibiotics has \\nany antifungal activity. Use of aminoglycosides such as neomycin \\nshould be avoided in cases of tympanic membrane rupture due \\nto their ototoxicity. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is best treated \\nwith quinolone otic drugs, which are considered less likely to \\nbe ototoxic.\\nTreatment with topical otic analgesics and ceruminolytics \\nis usually unnecessary. It is important with any topical therapy \\nto remove purulent discharge from the external auditory canal \\nwith a swab or with suction to permit instillation of the solu-\\ntion. Excess water should be removed after bathing and the ear \\ncanal dried using a hairdryer. The predisposing activity, such as \\nswimming or diving, should be avoided until the inflammation \\nhas resolved.\\nFungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, and dermatophytes are \\noccasionally isolated from the external ear. It may be difficult to \\ndetermine whether they represent normal flora or are the cause \\nof inflammation. In most cases, local therapy and restoration \\nof normal pH as recommended for bacterial otitis externa are \\nsufficient.\\nMalignant otitis externa is treated by parenteral antimicrobi-\\nals with activity against P . aeruginosa, such as an extended-\\nspectrum penicillin (piperacillin-tazobactam), a cephalosporin \\nwith activity against P . aeruginosa (ceftazidime, cefepime), or \\na fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin).\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nAcute otitis externa usually resolves promptly without complica-\\ntions within 1-2 days of initiating treatment. Persistent pain, \\nespecially if severe or if accompanied by other symptoms (e.g., \\nfever) should prompt re-evaluation for other conditions.\\nComplications of malignant otitis externa include invasion \\nof the bones at the base of the skull, which may cause cranial \\nnerve palsies. A mortality of 15-20% occurs in adults with \\nmalignant otitis media. Relapses within the first year after \\ntreatment are common.\\nPREVENTION\\nOverly vigorous cleaning of an asymptomatic auditory canal \\nshould be avoided. Drying the auditory canals with acetic acid \\n(2%), Burow solution, or diluted isopropyl alcohol (rubbing \\nalcohol) after swimming may be used prophylactically to help \\nprevent the maceration that facilitates bacterial invasion.

Fever is notably absent, and \\nhearing is unaffected. Tenderness with movement of the pinna, \\nespecially the tragus, and with chewing is particularly charac-\\nteristic, which are symptoms notably absent in otitis media. \\nInspection usually reveals that the lining of the auditory canal \\nis inflamed with mild to severe erythema and edema. Scant to \\ncopious discharge from the auditory canal may obscure the \\ntympanic membrane. The most common symptoms of malig-\\nnant otitis externa are similar, but facial nerve palsy occasionally \\noccurs. The most common physical findings are swelling and \\ngranulation tissue in the canal, usually with a discharge from \\nthe external auditory canal.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe diagnosis of uncomplicated otitis externa usually is estab-\\nlished solely on the basis of the clinical symptoms and physical \\nexamination findings without the need for additional laboratory \\nor microbiologic evaluation. Cultures are required to identify \\nthe etiological agent, which is usually P . aeruginosa, and the \\nantimicrobial susceptibility.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nOtitis media with tympanic perforation and discharge into \\nthe auditory canal may be confused with otitis externa.

Lateral radiograph reveals \\nthickened and bulging epiglottis (thumb sign) and swelling of \\nthe aryepiglottic folds. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct \\nobservation of the inflamed and swollen supraglottic structures \\nand swollen, cherry red epiglottitis. Direct observation of the \\nlarynx should only be performed in the operating room with an \\nanesthesiologist and a competent surgeon prepared to place an \\nendotracheal tube or perform a tracheostomy if needed. Epiglot-\\ntitis requires antibiotic therapy and endotracheal intubation to \\nmaintain the airway. Both onset and clinical recovery are rapid, \\nand most children can be extubated safely within 48-72 hours.\\nBacterial tracheitis is a rare but serious superinfection \\nof the trachea that may follow viral croup and is most com-\\nmonly caused by S. aureus.

During inspiration, the walls of the subglottic \\nspace are drawn together, aggravating the obstruction and \\nproducing the stridor characteristic of croup. Croup is most \\ncommon in children 6 months to 3 years of age, with a peak \\nin fall and early winter.

For significant airway compromise, administration of \\naerosolized racemic (D- and L-)epinephrine reduces subglottic \\nedema by adrenergic vasoconstriction, temporarily producing \\nmarked clinical improvement. The peak effect is within 10-30 \\nminutes and fades within 60-90 minutes. A rebound effect may \\noccur, with worsening of symptoms as the effect of the drug \\ndissipates. Aerosol treatment may need to be repeated every \\n20 minutes (for no more than 1-2 hours) in severe cases.\\nChildren should be kept as calm as possible to minimize \\nforceful inspiration. One useful calming method is for a child \\nwith croup to sit on the parent’s lap. Sedatives should be \\nused cautiously and in the intensive care unit only. Cool mist \\nadministered by face mask may help prevent drying of the \\nsecretions around the larynx.\\nHospitalization is often required for children with cyanosis, \\nor stridor at rest. Children receiving aerosol treatment should \\nbe hospitalized or observed for at least 2-3 hours because of the \\nrisk of rebound airway obstruction. Decreased symptoms may \\nindicate improvement or fatigue, and impending respiratory \\nfailure.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nThe most common complication of croup is viral pneumonia, \\nwhich occurs in 1-2% of children. Parainfluenza virus pneu-\\nmonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia are more common \\nin immunocompromised patients. Bacterial tracheitis may also \\nbe a complication of croup.\\nThe prognosis for croup is excellent. Illness usually lasts \\napproximately 5 days.

B. pertussis infects only humans and is \\ntransmitted person to person by coughing.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nThe typical incubation period is 7-10 days but can range between \\n5 and 21 days. Patients are most contagious during the first 2 \\nweeks of cough. The annual rate of pertussis was approximately \\n100-200 cases per 100,000 population in the prevaccination \\nera; worldwide there continue to be an estimated 15 million \\ncases of pertussis and 200,000 childhood deaths annually. In \\nthe United States the incidence of pertussis decreased after the \\nintroduction of vaccine, but it has increased steadily since the \\n1980s, with more than 18,000 cases reported in 2015. Pertussis \\nincidence peaks among those less than 6 months of age—infants \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable at StudentConsult.com\\nCough\\nCyanosis\\nApnea\\nClassic pertussis is seen in children between 1 and 10 years \\nold. The progression of the disease is divided into catarrhal, \\nparoxysmal, and convalescent stages. The catarrhal stage is \\nmarked by nonspecific signs (increased nasal secretions and \\nlow-grade fever) lasting 1-2 weeks. The paroxysmal stage is \\nthe most distinctive stage of pertussis and lasts 2-4 weeks. \\nCoughing occurs in paroxysms during expiration, causing \\nyoung children to lose their breath. This pattern of coughing \\nis needed to dislodge plugs of necrotic bronchial epithelial \\ntissues and thick mucus. The forceful inhalation against a \\nnarrowed glottis that follows this paroxysm of cough produces \\nthe characteristic whoop. Posttussive emesis is common. The \\nconvalescent stage is marked by gradual resolution of symptoms \\nover 1-2 weeks. Coughing becomes less severe, and the par -\\noxysms and whoops slowly disappear. Although the disease \\ntypically lasts 6-8 weeks, residual cough may persist for months, \\nespecially with physical stress or respiratory irritants.\\nInfants may not display the classic findings, and the first \\nsign in the neonate may be apnea. Y oung infants are unlikely \\nto have the classic whoop, more likely to have central nervous \\nsystem damage as a result of hypoxia, and more likely to have \\nsecondary bacterial pneumonia. Adolescents and adults with \\npertussis usually present with a prolonged bronchitic illness \\nwith persistent, nonproductive cough that often begins as \\na nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection. In general, \\nadolescents and adults do not have a whoop with the cough, \\nalthough they may have severe paroxysms.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe diagnosis depends on isolation of B. pertussis or detection \\nof its nucleic acids. Culture on specialized media is usually \\nperformed during the early phases of illness on specimens from \\nnasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates, but this can be difficult to \\naccomplish given the organism’s fastidious nature. Polymerase \\nchain reaction is available in many clinical laboratories. False-\\npositive results can occur. Direct fluorescent antibody staining \\nis not recommended. Serological tests are not useful for diagnos-\\ning acute infection but can be confirmatory in the convalescent \\nphase of illness, though there are no commercial kits approved \\nby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\\nLymphocytosis is present in 75-85% of infants and young \\nchildren but is not diagnostic.

All \\nclose contacts should receive prophylactic antibiotics for 5 days \\n(azithromycin) or 7-14 days (clarithromycin or erythromycin, \\nduration based on age).\\nCHAPTER 109 \\nBronchiolitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nBronchiolitis is a disease of small bronchioles with increased \\nmucus production and occasional bronchospasm, sometimes \\nleading to airway obstruction. It is most commonly caused by \\na viral lower respiratory tract infection. Bronchiolitis is most \\ncommonly seen in infants and young children, with most severe \\ncases occurring among infants. Bronchiolitis is potentially \\nlife-threatening.\\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of \\nbronchiolitis, followed in frequency by human metapneumo-\\nvirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, \\nrhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and, infrequently, Mycoplasma \\npneumoniae. Viral bronchiolitis is extremely contagious and is \\nspread by contact with infected respiratory secretions. Although \\ncoughing produces aerosols, hand carriage of contaminated \\nsecretions is the most frequent mode of transmission.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nBronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospitalization of infants. \\nBronchiolitis occurs almost exclusively during the first 2 years \\nof life, with a peak age at 2-6 months. Many healthy children \\nwith bronchiolitis can be managed as outpatients; however, \\npremature infants and children with chronic lung disease of \\nprematurity, hemodynamically significant congenital heart \\ndisease, neuromuscular weakness, or immunodeficiency are at \\nincreased risk of severe, potentially fatal disease. Children \\nacquire infection after exposure to infected family members, \\nwho typically have symptoms of an upper respiratory tract \\ninfection, or from infected children in day care. In the United \\nStates, annual peaks are usually in the late winter months from \\nDecember through March.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nincrease from 20,000/mm3 to more than 50,000/mm3, consisting \\nprimarily of mature lymphocytes. Physical examination and \\nradiographic signs of segmental lung atelectasis may develop \\nduring pertussis, especially during the paroxysmal stage. \\nPerihilar infiltrates are common and are similar to those seen \\nin viral pneumonia.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nFor a young child with classic pertussis, the diagnosis based \\non the pattern of illness is quite accurate. The paroxysmal stage \\nis the most distinctive part of the syndrome. Other causes of \\npertussis-like prolonged cough illnesses include Bordetella \\nparapertussis and Bordetella holmesii—which cause a similar \\nbut milder illness and are not prevented by B. pertussis  \\nvaccination—Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneu-\\nmoniae, adenoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus.\\nTREATMENT\\nMacrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or eryth-\\nromycin) are recommended for treatment. Azithromycin is \\npreferred in neonates due to the association between erythro-\\nmycin treatment and the development of pyloric stenosis. \\nTreatment during the catarrhal phase eradicates nasopharyngeal \\ncarriage of organisms within 3-4 days and may lessen symptom \\nseverity. Treatment in the paroxysmal stage does not alter the \\ncourse of illness but decreases the potential for spread to others. \\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternative therapy among \\nchildren older than 2 months, although studies of its use for \\nthis indication are limited.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nMajor complications are most common among infants and \\nyoung children and include hypoxia, apnea, pneumonia, seizures, \\nencephalopathy, malnutrition, and death. The most frequent \\ncomplication is pneumonia caused by B. pertussis  itself or \\nresulting from secondary bacterial infection with Streptococcus \\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. \\nAtelectasis may develop secondary to mucous plugs. The force \\nof the paroxysm may produce pneumomediastinum, pneumo-\\nthorax, or interstitial or subcutaneous emphysema; epistaxis; \\nhernias; and retinal and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Otitis \\nmedia and sinusitis may occur.\\nMost children recover normal pulmonary function with \\ncomplete healing of the respiratory epithelium. Most permanent \\ndisability is a result of encephalopathy.\\nPREVENTION\\nActive immunity is induced with acellular pertussis components \\ngiven as a vaccine in combination with the tetanus and diphtheria \\ntoxoids (DTaP). The acellular pertussis vaccines contain two \\nto five antigens of B. pertussis , including pertussis toxin, \\npertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and fimbrial agglutinogens \\nFIM-2 and FIM-3. DTaP vaccine is recommended at 2, 4, 6, \\nand 15-18 months, with a booster at 4-6 years, and has an \\nefficacy of 70-90%.

Indications \\nfor hospitalization include moderate to marked respiratory \\ndistress, hypoxemia, apnea, inability to tolerate oral feeding, \\nand lack of appropriate care available at home. Hospitalization \\nof high-risk children with bronchiolitis should be considered. \\nAmong hospitalized infants, supplemental oxygen by nasal \\ncannula is often necessary, but intubation and ventilatory \\nassistance for respiratory failure or apnea are required in <10% \\nof these infants. Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chest phys -\\niotherapy, and hypertonic saline are seldom effective and are \\nnot generally recommended. Likewise, antibiotics should be \\navoided unless there is strong suspicion for concomitant bacterial \\ninfection.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nMost hospitalized children show marked improvement in 2-5 \\ndays with supportive treatment alone. The course of the wheezing \\nphase varies, however. Tachypnea and hypoxia may progress \\nto respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation. Apnea is a \\nmajor concern for very young infants with bronchiolitis.\\nMost cases of bronchiolitis resolve completely, although \\nminor abnormalities of pulmonary function and bronchial \\nhyperreactivity may persist for several years. Recurrence is \\ncommon but tends to be mild and should be assessed and \\ntreated similarly to the first episode. The incidence of asthma \\nseems to be higher in children hospitalized for bronchiolitis \\nas infants, but it is unclear whether this is causal or whether \\nchildren prone to asthma are more likely to be hospitalized with \\nbronchiolitis. There is a 1-2% mortality rate, highest among \\ninfants with preexisting cardiopulmonary or immunological \\nimpairment.\\nPREVENTION\\nMonthly injections of palivizumab, an RSV-specific monoclonal \\nantibody, initiated just before the onset of the RSV season \\nconfers some protection from severe RSV disease. Palivizumab \\nis indicated for some infants with prematurity (born before 29 \\nweeks, 0 days’ gestation), chronic lung disease of prematurity, \\nand those with hemodynamically significant cyanotic and \\nacyanotic congenital heart disease in the first year of life, and \\nrarely in the second year of life. Immunization with influenza \\nvaccine is recommended for all children older than 6 months \\nand may prevent influenza-associated disease.\\nCHAPTER 110 \\nPneumonia\\nETIOLOGY\\nPneumonia is an infection of the lower respiratory tract that \\ninvolves the airways and parenchyma, with consolidation of \\nthe alveolar spaces. The term lower respiratory tract infection \\nrespiratory illness similar to the common cold in its early phase, \\nwith cough and rhinorrhea. It progresses over 3-7 days to noisy, \\nraspy breathing and audible wheezing. There is usually a low-\\ngrade fever accompanied by irritability, which may reflect the \\nincreased work of breathing. In contrast to the classic progression \\nof disease, young infants infected with RSV may not have a \\nprodrome and may have apnea as the first sign of infection.\\nPhysical signs of bronchiolar obstruction include pro -\\nlongation of the expiratory phase of breathing, nasal flaring, \\nintercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, and air trapping \\nwith hyperexpansion of the lungs. During the wheezing phase, \\npercussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, \\nbut auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles \\nthroughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, \\ngrunting and cyanosis may be present.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nRoutine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diag-\\nnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of \\nbronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen \\nsaturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory \\nmonitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure \\nmay develop precipitously in very tired infants even though \\nblood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are \\nreassuring.\\nRapid viral diagnosis of nasopharyngeal secretions performed \\nby polymerase chain reactions for RSV , parainfluenza viruses, \\ninfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses are sensitive tests to confirm \\nthe infection. Identifying the viral agent is helpful for cohorting \\nchildren with the same infection but is not necessary to make \\nthe diagnosis of bronchiolitis.\\nChest radiographs are not always necessary but frequently \\nshow signs of lung hyperinflation, including increased lung \\nlucency and flattened or depressed diaphragms. Areas of \\nincreased density may represent either viral pneumonia or \\nlocalized atelectasis.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe major difficulty in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is to \\ndifferentiate other diseases associated with wheezing. It may \\nbe difficult to differentiate asthma from bronchiolitis by physical \\nexamination, but age of presentation, presence of fever, and \\nabsence of personal or family history of asthma are the major \\ndifferential factors. Bronchiolitis occurs primarily in the first \\nyear of life and is accompanied by fever, whereas asthma usually \\npresents in older children with previous wheezing episodes \\ntypically unaccompanied by fever unless a respiratory tract \\ninfection is the trigger for the asthma exacerbation.\\nWheezing may also be due to an airway foreign body, \\ncongenital airway obstructive lesion, cystic fibrosis, exacerba-\\ntion of chronic lung disease, viral or bacterial pneumonia, \\nand other lower respiratory tract diseases (see Chapter 78). \\nCardiogenic asthma, which can be confused with bronchiolitis \\nin infants, is wheezing associated with pulmonary congestion \\nsecondary to left-sided heart failure. Wheezing associated with \\ngastroesophageal reflux is likely to be chronic or recurrent, and \\nthe patient may have a history of frequent emesis. Cystic fibrosis \\nis associated with poor growth, chronic diarrhea, and a positive \\nfamily history. A focal area on radiography that remains inflated \\ndespite changes in position suggests foreign body aspiration.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Pneumonia in patients \\nwith cystic fibrosis is usually caused by S. s aureus in infancy \\nand Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia cepacia in older \\npatients.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nImmunizations have markedly reduced the incidence of \\npneumonia caused by pertussis, diphtheria, measles, Haemophi-\\nlus influenzae type b, and S. pneumoniae. Where used, bacille \\nCalmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization for tuberculosis has \\nalso had some impact. Pneumonia is the single largest contribu-\\ntor of childhood mortality worldwide, killing an estimated 1 \\nmillion children under 5 years of age annually. Risk factors  \\nfor lower respiratory tract infections include gastroesopha -\\ngeal reflux, neurological impairment (aspiration), immuno -\\ncompromised states, anatomical abnormalities of the respiratory \\ntract, residence in residential care facilities, and hospitalization, \\nespecially in an intensive care unit.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nis often used to encompass bronchitis, bronchiolitis (see Chapter \\n109), pneumonia, or any combination of the three. Pneumonitis \\nis a general term for lung inflammation that may or may not \\nbe associated with consolidation. Lobar pneumonia describes \\npneumonia localized to one or more lobes of the lung. Atypical \\npneumonia describes patterns typically more diffuse or inter-\\nstitial than lobar pneumonia. Bronchopneumonia refers to \\ninflammation of the lung that is centered in the bronchioles \\nand leads to the production of a mucopurulent exudate that \\nobstructs some of these small airways and causes patchy \\nconsolidation of the adjacent lobules. Interstitial pneumonitis \\nrefers to inflammation of the interstitium, which is composed \\nof the walls of the alveoli, the alveolar sacs and ducts, and the \\nbronchioles. Interstitial pneumonitis is characteristic of acute \\nviral infections but may also be a chronic inflammatory or \\nfibrosing process.\\nDefects in host defenses increase the risk of pneumonia. \\nLower airways and secretions are sterile as a result of a \\nmultifactorial system. Airway contaminants are caught in the \\nmucus secreted by the goblet cells. Cilia on epithelial surfaces, \\ncomposing the ciliary elevator system, beat synchronously to \\nmove particles upward toward central airways and into the \\nthroat, where they are swallowed or expectorated. Polymor-\\nphonuclear neutrophils from the blood and tissue macrophages \\ningest and kill microorganisms. IgA secreted into the upper \\nairway fluid protects against invasive infections and facilitates \\nviral neutralization.\\nInfectious agents that commonly cause community-acquired \\npneumonia vary by age (Table 110.1). Streptococcus pneumoniae \\nis the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia (particularly \\nlobar pneumonia) and occurs in children of any age outside \\nthe neonatal period. Other common causes include respiratory \\nsyncytial virus (RSV) in infants (see Chapter 109), other respira-\\ntory viruses (parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, human \\nmetapneumovirus, adenoviruses) in children younger than 5 \\nyears old, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children older than \\nage 5 years. M. pneumoniae  and Chlamydophila pneumoniae \\nare principal causes of atypical pneumonia.\\nChlamydia trachomatis and less commonly Mycoplasma \\nhominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) \\ncause a similar respiratory syndrome in infants 2 weeks to 3 \\nmonths of age, with subacute onset of an afebrile pneumonia; \\ncough and hyperinflation are the predominant signs. These \\ninfections are difficult to diagnose and distinguish from each \\nother. In adults these organisms are carried primarily as part \\nof the genital mucosal flora. Women who harbor these agents \\nmay transmit them perinatally to newborns.\\nAdditional agents occasionally cause pneumonia. Severe \\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is due to SARS-associated \\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV). Avian influenza (bird flu) is a highly \\ncontagious viral disease of poultry and other birds caused by \\ninfluenza A (H5N1). There were outbreaks among humans in \\nSoutheast Asia in 1997 and 2003-2004, with high mortality rates. \\nA novel influenza A (H1N1) of swine origin began circulating \\nin 2009. Other etiological agents to consider, based on specific \\nexposure history, include Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus \\npyogenes (especially after influenza infection), Mycobacterium \\ntuberculosis, Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, \\nChlamydophila psittaci, Legionella pneumophila,  hantavirus, \\nHistoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces \\ndermatitidis, and oral flora or gram-negative bacilli (after \\naspiration).\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nCough\\nWheezing\\nHemoptysis\\nChest Pain\\nAbdominal Pain\\nFailure to Thrive\\nAcidemia\\nAge is a determinant in the clinical manifestations of pneumonia. \\nNeonates may have fever or hypoxia only, with subtle or absent \\nphysical examination findings (see Chapter 65).

Dullness \\nto percussion may be due to lobar or segmental infiltrates or \\npleural fluid. Auscultation may be normal in early or very focal \\npneumonia, but the presence of localized crackles, rhonchi, and \\nwheezes may help one detect and locate pneumonia. Distant \\nbreath sounds may indicate a large, poorly ventilated area of \\nconsolidation or pleural fluid.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nBacterial flora of the upper respiratory tract do not accurately \\nreflect flora present in lower respiratory tract infections, and \\nhigh-quality sputum is rarely obtainable from children. In \\notherwise healthy children without life-threatening disease, \\ninvasive procedures to obtain lower respiratory tissue or secre-\\ntions are seldom indicated. Serological tests are not useful for \\nthe most common causes of bacterial pneumonia.\\nThe white blood cell (WBC) count with viral pneumonias \\nis often normal or mildly elevated, with a predominance of \\nlymphocytes, whereas with bacterial pneumonias the WBC \\ncount is elevated (>15-20,000/mm3), with a predominance of \\nneutrophils. Mild eosinophilia is characteristic of infant C. \\ntrachomatis pneumonia. Blood cultures should be performed on \\nill, hospitalized children to attempt to diagnose a bacterial cause \\nof pneumonia. Blood cultures identify a bacterial respiratory \\npathogen in 5-10% of children hospitalized for pneumonia \\n(and 10-20% of those with pneumonia with empyema or \\nlarge effusion). Urinary antigen tests are especially useful for \\nL. pneumophila (Legionnaires disease).\\nViral respiratory pathogens can be diagnosed using poly -\\nmerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid viral antigen detection, \\nbut neither can rule out concomitant bacterial pneumonia. \\nM. pneumoniae can be confirmed by Mycoplasma PCR.

Lung abscess is an uncommon problem in \\nchildren and is usually caused by aspiration, infection behind an \\nobstructed bronchus, or certain virulent organisms. Anaerobic \\nbacteria usually predominate, along with various streptococci, \\nEscherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P . aeruginosa, and S. \\naureus. Chest radiograph or CT scan reveals a cavitary lesion, \\noften with an air-fluid level, surrounded by parenchymal \\ninflammation. If the cavity communicates with the bronchi, \\norganisms may be isolated from sputum. Diagnostic bronchos-\\ncopy may be indicated to exclude a foreign body and obtain \\nmicrobiologic specimens.

The management \\nof infections on the endothelial surfaces of blood vessels \\n(endovascular infections) is very similar. Turbulent flow from \\ncongenital heart disease or an indwelling central venous catheter \\ncan result in endothelial damage. Fibrin and platelets gather \\nat the site, forming a thrombus. In the setting of transient \\nbacteremia, this lesion can become infected and can result in \\na vegetation, which usually occurs on a valve leaflet and is \\ncomposed of microorganisms trapped in a fibrin mesh that \\nextends into the bloodstream.\\nMany microorganisms have been reported to cause endocar-\\nditis, although there are only a few common causes in children \\n(Table 111.1). Streptococcus viridans is the principal cause in \\nchildren with congenital heart diseases without previous surgery. \\nStaphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci \\n(CONS) are important causes of endocarditis, especially fol -\\nlowing cardiac surgery and in the presence of prosthetic cardiac \\nand endovascular materials. Gram-negative endocarditis is rare. \\nCandida species can cause fungal endocarditis, especially in \\npremature infants with central venous catheters and/or on \\nparenteral nutrition.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nRheumatic heart disease used to be a major risk factor for IE \\nbut has become much less common. Patients at highest risk \\nfor IE include those with prosthetic cardiac valves and children \\nwho have cyanotic congenital heart disease, either with or \\nwithout repair. The risk in these patients is increased after dental \\nand oral procedures, instrumentation, or surgical procedures \\nof the respiratory, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal tracts.

Multiple blood cultures should \\nbe obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy. For optimal \\nsensitivity, adequate volumes of blood should be obtained, \\n1-3 mL f or infants and young children and at least 5-7  mL f or \\nolder children. If volumes are not adequate, emphasis should \\nbe placed on obtaining aerobic blood cultures, as anaerobic \\norganisms rarely cause IE. If possible, in patients who are not \\ncritically ill, empiric antibiotic therapy should be held until at \\nleast three sets of blood cultures (from different venipuncture \\nsites) are obtained. Patients who have recently been treated \\nwith antibiotics or who are currently receiving antibiotics should \\nhave additional serial cultures performed. Despite adequate \\nblood culture techniques, the microbiologic diagnosis is not \\nconfirmed in 5-15% of cases, known as culture-negative \\nendocarditis.\\nThe agent in culture-negative endocarditis may be identi -\\nfied by antibody testing and examination of the valve tissue \\n(following surgery) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for \\nbacterial (16S) or fungal (18S) ribosomal RNA.\\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are \\noften elevated. Leukocytosis, anemia, and hematuria are common \\nlaboratory findings.\\nEchocardiography should be performed in all cases where \\nIE is suspected. It can be used to visualize vegetations and \\nassess valvular regurgitation and conduit flow. Transesophageal \\nechocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than transthoracic \\nechocardiography (TTE) for adolescents and adults and for \\npatients with prosthetic valves, but it is often unnecessary in \\nchildren.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nIE must be differentiated from other causes of bacteremia and \\nother cardiac conditions. The modified Duke criteria can be \\nused to assist in the diagnosis of IE (Table 111.2). Noninfectious \\ncauses of endocardial vegetations must be excluded, such as \\nsterile clots. Prolonged bacteremia can be caused by infectious \\nendothelial foci outside of the heart, often associated with \\ncongenital vascular malformations, vascular trauma, an infected \\nvenous thrombosis, or previous vascular surgery.\\nTREATMENT\\nSeverely ill patients must be stabilized with supportive therapies \\nfor cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and low cardiac output \\n(see Chapter 145). Empirical antibiotic therapy may be started \\nfor acutely ill patients after blood cultures are obtained. With \\nsubacute disease, awaiting results of blood cultures to confirm \\nthe diagnosis is recommended to direct therapy according  \\nto the susceptibility of the isolate. Because antibiotics must \\nreach the organisms by passive diffusion through the fibrin \\nmesh, high doses of bactericidal antibiotics are required for an \\nextended period of treatment (4-8 weeks). Exact duration of \\ntherapy varies depending on the presence of prosthetic material \\nand the causative organism. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia \\ncan be persistent, and if associated with an indwelling catheter, \\nrequires line removal in most cases.

In general, diarrhea is caused \\nby a variety of infectious or inflammatory processes in the \\nintestine that directly affect enterocyte secretory and absorptive \\nfunctions. Gastroenteritis or enteritis has many infectious causes, \\nincluding viruses, bacteria, and parasites (Table 112.1). Based \\non pathogenesis, diarrhea can be classified as invasive or \\ninflammatory, or it can be classified as secretory, producing \\neither bloody stools with abdominal cramping and fever or \\nlarge quantities of watery stool without other symptoms (Table \\n112.2).\\nInfectious diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and \\nmortality in children around the world. Rates of disease and \\ndeath vary with age and access to health care, clean water, and \\nsanitation. Gastrointestinal infections are generally acquired via \\nfecal-oral transmission or through ingestion of contaminated \\nfood or water. The patient’s immune status and environmental \\nexposures (i.e., food, water, travel, antibiotics, child care) \\nhelp guide the differential diagnosis in the presence of acute \\ngastrointestinal symptoms. Traveler’s diarrhea occurs frequently, \\nespecially within the first 1-2 weeks of arrival. Epidemiology \\nvaries with destination, but in general children are at risk for \\nthe same illnesses that affect adult travelers.\\nViral gastroenteritis is the most common cause of diarrhea in \\nchildren globally. These illnesses may be associated with vomiting \\nas well as diarrhea, have incubation periods of hours to days, \\nand are usually self-limited illnesses lasting 3-7 days.

Infants \\n<12 months of age should not be tested for C. difficile as they \\nare frequently asymptomatically colonized with the organism \\nin their stool, possibly due to a lack of the receptor required \\nfor infection.

Amebiasis occurs in warmer \\nclimates, whereas giardiasis is endemic throughout the United \\nStates and is common among infants in daycare centers. E. \\nhistolytica infects the colon; amebae may pass through the \\nbowel wall and invade the liver, lung, and brain. Diarrhea is \\nof acute onset, is bloody, and contains leukocytes. G. lamblia \\nis transmitted through ingestion of cysts, either from contact \\nwith an infected individual or from food or freshwater or well \\nwater contaminated with infected feces. The organism adheres to \\nthe microvilli of the duodenal and jejunal epithelium. Insidious \\nonset of progressive anorexia, nausea, gaseousness, abdominal \\ndistention, watery diarrhea, secondary lactose intolerance, and \\nweight loss is characteristic of giardiasis. Cryptosporidium \\ncauses mild, watery diarrhea in immunocompetent persons \\nthat resolves without treatment. It produces severe, prolonged \\nreasons. In the United States, the most common bacterial \\nfood-borne causes (in order of frequency) are nontyphoidal \\nSalmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, \\nYersinia, Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. Food-borne \\ndiarrhea can also result from ingestion of preformed enterotoxins \\nproduced by bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus \\ncereus, which multiply in contaminated foods, and nonbacterial \\ntoxins such as from fish, shellfish, and mushrooms. After a \\nshort incubation period, vomiting and cramps are prominent \\nsymptoms, and diarrhea may or may not be present. Heavy \\nmetals that leach into canned food or drinks causing gastric \\nirritation and emetic syndromes may mimic symptoms of acute \\ninfectious enteritis.\\nNontyphoidal Salmonella produces diarrhea by invading \\nthe intestinal mucosa. The organisms are transmitted through \\ncontact with infected animals (chickens, iguanas, other reptiles, \\nturtles) or from contaminated food products, such as dairy \\nproducts, eggs, and poultry. A large inoculum of organisms \\nis required for disease because Salmonella is killed by gastric \\nacidity. The incubation period for gastroenteritis ranges from \\n6 to 72 hours but is usually less than 24 hours.\\nShigella dysenteriae may cause disease by producing Shiga \\ntoxin. The incubation period is 1-7 days. Infected adults may \\nshed organisms for 1 month. Infection is spread by person-\\nto-person contact or by the ingestion of contaminated food \\nwith 10-100 organisms. The colon is selectively affected. High \\nfever and febrile seizures may occur in addition to diarrhea.\\nOnly certain strains of E. coli produce diarrhea. Strains \\nassociated with enteritis are classified by the mechanism of \\ndiarrhea: enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) \\nor Shiga toxin–producing (STEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), \\nenteropathogenic (EPEC), or enteroaggregative (EAEC). \\nETEC strains produce heat-labile (cholera-like) enterotoxin, \\nheat-stable enterotoxin, or both. ETEC is a frequent cause of \\ntraveler’s diarrhea. ETEC adhere to the epithelial cells in the \\nupper small intestine and produces disease by liberating toxins \\nthat induce intestinal secretion and limit absorption. EHEC \\nor STEC, especially the E. coli O157:H7 strain, produces a \\nShiga-like toxin that is responsible for a hemorrhagic colitis \\nand most cases of diarrhea associated with hemolytic uremic \\nsyndrome (HUS), which presents with microangiopathic hemo-\\nlytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure (see Chapter \\n164). STEC is associated with contaminated food, including \\nunpasteurized fruit juices and especially undercooked beef, \\nand can present with nonbloody diarrhea that then becomes \\nTABLE 112.2 Mechanisms of Infectious Diarrhea\\nPRIMARY MECHANISM DEFECT STOOL EXAMINATION EXAMPLES COMMENTS\\nSecretory Decreased absorption, \\nincreased secretion: \\nelectrolyte transport\\nWatery, normal osmolality Cholera, toxigenic \\nEscherichia coli (EPEC, \\nETEC); carcinoid, \\nClostridium difficile, \\ncryptosporidiosis (in AIDS)\\nPersists during fasting; \\nbile salt malabsorption \\nalso may increase \\nintestinal water secretion; \\nno stool leukocytes\\nMucosal invasion Inflammation, decreased \\nmucosal surface area and/\\nor colonic reabsorption, \\nincreased motility\\nBlood and increased \\nWBCs in stool\\nCeliac disease, \\nSalmonella infection, \\nshigellosis, amebiasis, \\nyersiniosis, \\nCampylobacter infection\\nDysentery (blood, mucus, \\nand WBCs)\\nWBCs, White blood cells; infection may also contribute to increased motility.\\nFrom Wyllie R.

The degree of dehydration dictates the urgency of \\nthe situation and the volume of fluid needed for rehydration. \\nMild to moderate dehydration can usually be treated with oral \\nrehydration; severe dehydration usually requires intravenous \\nrehydration and may even require admission to an intensive \\ncare unit.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nInitial laboratory evaluation of moderate to severe diarrhea \\nincludes electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and \\nurinalysis for specific gravity as an indicator of hydration. Stool \\nspecimens should be examined for mucus, blood, and leukocytes, \\nwhich indicate colitis in response to bacteria that diffusely \\ninvade the colonic mucosa. Patients infected with Shiga toxin–\\nproducing E. coli and E. histolytica generally have minimal \\nfecal leukocytes.\\nViral polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—also called the \\nnucleic and amplification test (NAAT)—assays may be used \\nif the diagnosis will alter management.

Many noninfectious causes \\nof diarrhea produce chronic diarrhea, with persistence for more \\nthan 14 days. Persistent or chronic symptoms may require tests \\nfor malabsorption or invasive studies, including endoscopy and \\nsmall bowel biopsy.\\nTREATMENT\\nMost infectious causes of diarrhea in children are self-limited. \\nAntibiotics are not generally useful and may be a risk factor \\nin the development of HUS when E. coli O157:H7 is present. \\nManagement of viral and most bacterial causes of diarrhea is \\nprimarily supportive and consists of correcting dehydration \\nand ongoing fluid and electrolyte deficits.\\nHyponatremia is common; hypernatremia is less common. \\nMetabolic acidosis results from losses of bicarbonate in stool, \\nlactic acidosis results from shock, and phosphate retention results \\nfrom transient prerenal-renal insufficiency.

Among \\ninfectious causes of hepatitis, viruses play an important role. \\nThe six primary hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis A to G, differ \\nin their virological characteristics, transmission, severity, likeli-\\nhood of persistence, and subsequent risk of causing hepatocel-\\nlular carcinoma (Table 113.1). The cause of 10-15% of cases of \\nacute hepatitis is unknown.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nHepatitis A virus (HAV) is the most common cause of acute \\nviral hepatitis and is spread by fecal-oral transmission. HAV \\nis common in children globally, especially in areas of poor \\nsanitation. Among U.S. children, infection due to HAV was \\noften associated with childcare settings; however, rates have \\ndecreased since the introduction of routine vaccination. Hepatitis \\nB virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis D virus \\n(HDV) infections can result in chronic hepatitis, or a chronic \\ncarrier state, which facilitates spread. HDV , also known as the \\ndelta agent, is a defective virus that requires HBV for spread \\nand causes either coinfection with HBV or superinfection in \\nchronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Routine \\nvaccination has also been effective in reducing the rates of \\nHBV infection, especially in children.\\nThe major risk factors for HBV and HCV are injectable \\ndrug use, frequent exposure to blood products, and perinatal \\ntransmission from maternal infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) \\ninfection occurs following travel to endemic areas (South Asia) \\noutside of the United States. Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is prevalent \\nin HIV-infected persons. HBV and HCV cause chronic infection, \\nwhich may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and \\nrepresents a persistent risk of transmission.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nTreatment of traveler’s diarrhea is generally supportive, \\nalthough antibiotics can be indicated in instances of bloody \\ndiarrhea or a febrile illness, in which case azithromycin is a \\nrecommended choice for children. Due to lack of consistent \\naccess to health care in many areas, providing a prescription \\nto a family in advance of travel to a high-risk area such as in \\nAsia, Africa, or South America may be considered.\\nTreatment of C. difficile (pseudomembranous colitis) includes \\ndiscontinuation of the inciting antibiotic and oral metroni -\\ndazole or vancomycin. E. histolytica dysentery is treated with \\nmetronidazole followed by a luminal agent, such as iodoquinol. \\nThe treatment of G. lamblia is metronidazole, tinidazole, or \\nnitazoxanide.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nThe major complication of gastroenteritis is dehydration and \\nhypovolemic shock. Seizures may occur with high fever, \\nespecially with Shigella. Intestinal abscesses can form with \\nShigella, Yersinia, and Salmonella infections, leading to intestinal \\nperforation, a life-threatening complication. Severe vomiting \\nassociated with gastroenteritis can cause esophageal tears or \\naspiration pneumonia.\\nDeaths resulting from diarrhea reflect the principal problem \\nof disruption of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, which can \\nlead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hemodynamic \\ninstability, and shock. Diarrheal diseases cause approximately \\n10% of childhood deaths worldwide.\\nPREVENTION\\nThe most important means of preventing childhood diarrhea \\nis the provision of clean, uncontaminated water and proper \\nhygiene in growing, collecting, and preparing foods. Good \\nhygienic measures, especially appropriate handwashing with \\nsoap and water, are the best means of controlling person-to-\\nperson spread of most organisms causing gastroenteritis. Poultry \\nproducts should be considered potentially contaminated with \\nSalmonella and should be handled and cooked appropriately. \\nFamilies should also be aware of the risk of acquiring salmonel-\\nlosis from household reptile pets. Transmission of Salmonella \\nfrom reptiles can be prevented by thorough handwashing after \\nhandling the animals or their cages. Children under 5 years of \\nage and immunocompromised persons should avoid contact \\nwith reptiles.\\nImmunization against rotavirus infection is recommended \\nfor all children beginning at 6 weeks of age, with the first dose \\nby 14 weeks 6 days and the last dose by 8 months (see Chapter \\n94). Two typhoid vaccines are licensed in the United States: \\nan oral live-attenuated vaccine (Ty21a) for children 6 years of \\nage and older and a capsular polysaccharide vaccine (ViCPS) \\nfor intramuscular administration for children 2 years of age \\nand older. These are recommended for travelers to endemic \\nareas of developing countries or for household contacts of S. \\ntyphi chronic carriers.\\nThe risk for traveler’s diarrhea, caused primarily by ETEC, \\nmay be minimized by avoiding uncooked food and untreated \\ndrinking water. Symptomatic self-treatment for mild diarrhea \\nwith an oral rehydration solution is recommended for children \\nat least 6 years of age and adults.

In acute HBV infection the likelihood of symptoms \\nincreases with age, ranging from 1% of infants <12 months of \\nage to 30-50% of people >5 years. In HBV infection, the \\npreicteric phase, which lasts approximately 1 week, is character-\\nized by headache, anorexia, malaise, abdominal discomfort, \\nnausea, and vomiting; it usually precedes the onset of clinically \\ndetectable disease. Extrahepatic manifestations such as arthralgia, \\narthritis, rash, thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis, or papular \\nacrodermatitis (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) can occur early \\nin the illness. Jaundice and tender hepatomegaly occur later \\nand characterize the icteric phase. Prodromal symptoms, \\nparticularly in children, may abate during the icteric phase. \\nHepatic enzymes may increase 15- to 20-fold. Resolution of \\nthe hyperbilirubinemia and normalization of the transaminases \\nmay take 6-8 weeks.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase \\n(AST) levels are elevated and generally reflect the degree of \\nparenchymal inflammation. Alkaline phosphatase and total and \\ndirect (conjugated) bilirubin levels indicate the degree of \\ncholestasis, which results from hepatocellular and bile duct \\ndamage. The prothrombin time is a good predictor of severe \\nhepatocellular injury and progression to fulminant hepatic \\nfailure (see Chapter 130).\\nThe diagnosis of viral hepatitis is confirmed by serologi -\\ncal testing (see Table 113.1 and Fig. 113.1). The presence of \\nIgM-specific antibody to HAV with low or absent IgG antibody \\nis presumptive evidence of acute HAV infection.\\nThe presence of HBsAg signifies acute or chronic infection \\nwith HBV . Antigenemia appears early in the illness and is usually \\ntransient but is characteristic of chronic infection. Maternal \\nHBsAg status should always be determined when HBV infection \\nis diagnosed in children younger than 1 year of age because of \\nthe likelihood of vertical transmission. Hepatitis B early antigen \\n(HBeAg) appears in the serum with acute HBV . The continued \\npresence of HBsAg and HBeAg in the absence of antibody to e \\nantigen (anti-HBe) indicates high risk of transmissibility that is \\nassociated with ongoing viral replication. Clearance of HBsAg \\nfrom the serum precedes a variable window period, followed \\nby the emergence of the antibody to surface antigen (anti-HBs), \\nwhich indicates development of lifelong immunity and is also a \\nmarker of immunization. Antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc) \\nis a useful marker for recognizing HBV infection during the \\nwindow phase (when HBsAg has disappeared but before the \\nappearance of anti-HBs). Anti-HBe is useful in predicting a \\nlow degree of infectivity during the carrier state.\\nSeroconversion after HCV infection may occur 6 months \\nafter infection. A positive result of HCV enzyme-linked \\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) should be confirmed with the \\nmore specific recombinant immunoblot assay, which detects \\nantibodies to multiple HCV antigens. Detection of HCV RNA \\nby polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive marker for \\nactive infection, and results may be positive just 3 days after \\ninoculation.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Bacterial sepsis can also cause hepatic inflam-\\nmation and dysfunction. Patients with cholecystitis, cholangitis, \\nand choledocholithiasis may present with acute symptoms and \\njaundice. Other causes of acute liver disease in childhood include \\ndrugs (isoniazid, phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, oral \\ncontraceptives, acetaminophen), parenteral nutrition, toxins \\n(ethanol, poisonous mushroom), Wilson disease, metabolic \\ndisease (galactosemia, tyrosinemia, mitochondrial disorders), \\nα1-antitrypsin deficiency, tumor, shock, anoxia, autoimmune \\nhepatitis, hemophagocytic syndromes, and graft-versus-host \\ndisease (see Chapter 130).\\nTREATMENT\\nThe treatment of acute hepatitis is largely supportive and involves \\nrest, hydration, and adequate nutrition. Hospitalization is \\nindicated for children with severe vomiting and dehydration, \\na prolonged prothrombin time, or signs of hepatic encepha-\\nlopathy. When the diagnosis of viral hepatitis is established, \\nattention should be directed toward preventing its spread to \\nclose contacts. For HAV , hygienic measures include hand -\\nwashing and careful disposal of excreta, contaminated diapers \\nor clothing, needles, and other blood-contaminated items.\\nThe treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infections is evolv-\\ning with the development of new antivirals. The decision to \\ntreat is based on the patient’s age, viral genotype, and stage of \\nviral infection.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nMost cases of acute viral hepatitis resolve without specific \\ntherapy, with less than 0.1% of cases progressing to fulminant \\nhepatic necrosis. HAV and HEV cause acute infection only. \\nHBV , HCV , and HDV may persist as chronic infection, with \\nchronic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis and the associated \\nrisk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\\nFrom 5 to 10% of adults with HBV develop persistent \\ninfection, defined by persistence of HBsAg in the blood for \\nmore than 6 months, compared with 90% of children who \\nacquire HBV by perinatal transmission. Chronic HBsAg carriers \\nare usually HBeAg-negative and have no clinical, biochemi-\\ncal, or serological evidence of active hepatitis unless there is \\nsuperinfection with HDV . Approximately 10-15% of HBsAg \\ncarriers eventually clear HBsAg.\\nApproximately 85% of persons infected with HCV remain \\nchronically infected, which is characterized by fluctuating \\ntransaminase levels (see Fig. 113.1). There is poor correlation \\nof symptoms with ongoing liver damage. Approximately 20% of \\npersons with chronic infection develop cirrhosis, and approxi-\\nmately 25% of those develop hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV \\ninfection and ethanol use increase the risk of HCV progression.\\nPREVENTION\\nGood hygienic practices significantly reduce the risk of fecal–oral \\ntransmission of HAV .

It is only during the first year of life that the incidence \\nof UTIs in males exceeds that in females; during this period \\nuncircumcised boys are at 10-fold greater risk of developing a \\nUTI compared to circumcised boys. After 12 months of age, \\nUTI in healthy children usually is seen in girls.\\nA short urethra predisposes girls to UTIs. Obstruction to \\nurine flow and urinary stasis is the major risk factor and may \\nresult from anatomical abnormalities, nephrolithiasis, renal \\ntumor, indwelling urinary catheter, ureteropelvic junction \\nobstruction, megaureter, extrinsic compression, and pregnancy. \\nSevere vesicoureteral reflux, whether primary or secondary \\nto urinary tract obstruction, predisposes to chronic infection \\nand renal scarring. Scarring may also develop in the absence \\nof reflux. Constipation or withholding urine also increases the \\nrisk of UTI.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nUnvaccinated household and sexual contacts of persons with \\nHAV should receive postexposure prophylaxis as soon as possible \\nand within 2 weeks of the last exposure. A single dose of HAV \\nvaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred for persons 12 \\nmonths to 40 years of age. Immunoglobulin (0.02 mL/kg) g iven \\nintramuscularly (IGIM) is preferred for children under 12 \\nmonths of age, persons over 40 years of age, and immuno-\\ncompromised persons. For preexposure prophylaxis, unvac -\\ncinated travelers to endemic regions who are 12 months of age \\nor older should also receive a single dose of HAV vaccine \\nadministered at any time before departure. Infants <12 months \\nof age, older adults, immunocompromised people, or those \\nwith chronic liver disease or other chronic medical conditions \\ncan receive IGIM along with the HAV vaccine dose to optimize \\nprotection. This regimen can also be considered for travel <2 \\nweeks in the future.\\nHBV vaccine is recommended for routine immunization of \\nall infants beginning at birth and for all children and adolescents \\nthrough 18 years of age who have not been immunized previ-\\nously (see Fig. 94.1). It is also recommended as a preexposure \\nvaccination for older children and adults at increased risk of \\nsexual, percutaneous, or mucosal exposure to HBV as well as \\nthose with chronic liver disease, human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), and travelers to areas of endemic HBV infection. \\nRoutine prenatal screening for HBsAg is recommended for all \\npregnant women in the United States. Infants born to HBsAg-\\npositive mothers should receive HBV vaccine and hepatitis B \\nimmunoglobulin (HBIG; 0.5 mL) w ithin 12 hours of birth, with \\nsubsequent vaccine doses at 1 and 6 months of age followed by \\ntesting for HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9-15 months of age. Infants \\nborn to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive \\nvaccine within 12 hours of birth. If maternal testing is positive \\nfor HBsAg, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible \\n(no later than 1 week of age). The combination of HBIG and \\nvaccination is 99% effective in preventing vertical transmission \\nof HBV . Vaccination alone without HBIG may prevent 75% of \\ncases of perinatal HBV transmission and approximately 95% \\nof cases of symptomatic childhood HBV infection.\\nPostexposure prophylaxis of unvaccinated persons using \\nHBIG and vaccine is recommended following needle-stick \\ninjuries with blood from an HBsAg-positive patient and for \\nsexual or needle-sharing contacts or victims of sexual abuse \\nby an HBsAg-positive person.

The urinary tract and urine \\nare normally sterile. Escherichia coli, ascending from bowel \\n(perineum) flora, accounts for 85% of first infections. Other \\nbacteria commonly causing infection include Klebsiella, Proteus, \\nEnterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter.

Older children with UTI are treated for \\n7-14 days of enteral antibiotics or a combination of parenteral \\nfollowed by enteral antibiotic therapy. Initial treatment with \\nparenteral antibiotics in this age group is determined by clinical \\nstatus. Parenteral antibiotics should be continued until there is \\nclinical improvement (typically 24-48 hours), defined as resolu-\\ntion of fever and improved oral intake. Empiric antibiotic therapy \\nshould be guided by the local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns \\nand the results of the patient’s prior urine cultures because of \\nincreasing problems related to antimicrobial resistance. Defini-\\ntive antibiotic therapy should be guided by the patient’s urine \\nculture results. Commonly used empiric parenteral antibiotics \\ninclude cefazolin, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin plus gentamicin. \\nOral regimens include a cephalexin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic \\nacid, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Infants and children \\nwho do not show the expected clinical response within 2 days \\nof starting antimicrobial therapy should be re-evaluated, have \\nanother urine specimen obtained for culture, and undergo \\nimaging promptly to evaluate for renal abscess.\\nThe degree of toxicity, dehydration, and ability to retain \\noral intake of fluids should be assessed carefully. Restoring \\nor maintaining adequate hydration, including correction of \\nelectrolyte abnormalities that are often associated with vomiting \\nor poor oral intake, is important.\\nCOMPLICATIONS AND PROGNOSIS\\nBacteremia occurs in approximately 5% of patients with \\npyelonephritis and is more likely in infants than in older \\nchildren. Focal renal abscesses are an uncommon complication. \\nParents should be counseled to follow up for evaluation for \\nsubsequent fevers to determine the possibility of a recurrence \\nof UTI. If a recurrent UTI is diagnosed, further imaging studies \\n(VCUG) are indicated, if not already performed, to evaluate \\nthe possibility of vesicoureteral reflux (see Chapter 167).\\nPREVENTION\\nPrimary prevention is achieved by promoting good perineal \\nhygiene and managing underlying risk factors for UTI, such \\nas chronic constipation, encopresis, and daytime and nighttime \\nurinary incontinence. There is evidence that antibiotic prophy-\\nlaxis may prevent more severe symptomatic recurrent infections, \\nalthough the effect is small and is associated with the develop-\\nment of resistant organisms. The impact of secondary prophylaxis \\nto prevent renal scarring is unknown. Acidification of the urine \\nwith cranberry juice is not recommended as the sole means of \\npreventing UTI in children at high risk.\\nCHAPTER 115 \\nVulvovaginitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nVulvovaginitis, which is inflammation of the vulva or vagina or \\nboth, is the most common gynecological problem in prepubertal \\nof infection, collect urine by catheterization prior to starting \\nantibiotics.\\nUrinalysis showing pyuria (leukocyturia of >10 white blood \\ncells [WBCs]/mm 3) suggests infection but is also consistent \\nwith urethritis, vaginitis, nephrolithiasis, glomerulonephritis, \\nand interstitial nephritis. Other urinalysis findings suggestive \\nof infection include any bacteria per high-powered field in the \\nunstained uncentrifuged urinary sediment, positive urinary leu-\\nkocyte esterase test, and positive urinary nitrite test. Combined \\ntesting for leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and microscopic bacteria \\nhas almost 100% sensitivity for detecting UTI by positivity of ≥1 \\nof the three tests. The negative predictive value of a urinalysis \\nis about 100% if all three tests are negative and may obviate the \\nneed for culture except in neonates, where urinalysis results \\nare less reliable predictors of infection.\\nUltrasonography of the bladder and kidneys is recommended \\nfor infants and non–toilet trained children with first-time febrile \\nUTIs so as to exclude structural abnormalities or detect hydro-\\nnephrosis. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is indicated if \\nthe ultrasound is abnormal (hydronephrosis, scarring, or other \\nfindings suggesting obstruction or congenital abnormality). \\nVesicoureteral reflux is the most common abnormality found \\nand is ranked from grade I (ureter only) to grade V (complete \\ngross dilation of the ureter and obliteration of caliceal and pelvic \\nanatomy) (see Chapter 167). A technetium-99m dimercaptosuc-\\ncinic acid (DMSA) scan can identify acute pyelonephritis and \\nis most useful to define renal scarring as a late effect of UTI.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe diagnosis of a UTI is confirmed by a positive urine culture, \\nbut this does not distinguish between upper and lower tract \\ninfection. Localization of a UTI is important because upper \\nPyelonephritis is associated more frequently with bacteremia \\nand anatomical abnormalities than is uncomplicated cystitis. \\nThe clinical manifestations of UTI do not reliably distinguish \\nthe site of infection in neonates, infants, and toddlers. Fever \\nand abdominal pain may occur with either lower or upper \\nUTI, although high fever, vomiting, costovertebral tenderness, \\nleukocytosis on complete blood count (CBC), and bacteremia \\neach suggest upper tract involvement.\\nThe manifestations of UTI overlap with signs of sepsis seen \\nin young children and with enteritis, appendicitis, mesenteric \\nlymphadenitis, and pneumonia in older children.

There is significant DNA homology \\nbetween types 1 and 2. The virus initially infects mucosal surfaces \\nand enters cutaneous neurons, where it migrates along the \\naxons to sensory ganglia. As viral replication occurs in the \\nganglia, infectious virus moves along the axon to infect and \\ndestroy epithelial cells. Infection may disseminate to other \\norgans in immunocompromised patients. Virus latency is \\nmaintained in the ganglia where it undergoes periodic reactiva-\\ntion and replication triggered by undefined events. Although \\neither virus can be found in any site, HSV-1 more commonly \\noccurs in the central nervous system, eyes, and mouth, whereas \\nHSV-2 more commonly involves the genitalia. Reinfection can \\noccur with exposure to the other type or even a second strain \\nof the same type.\\nPrimary genital herpes is characterized by multiple painful, \\ngrouped vesicles or ulcerative and crusted external genital lesions \\non an erythematous base (see Table 116.2). In females the cervix \\nmay also be involved. Symptoms may include fever, regional \\nlymphadenopathy, discharge, and dysuria. Primary illness lasts \\n10-20 days. Asymptomatic primary infection may also occur. \\nSecondary, recurrent, or reactivation eruptions are not as \\ndramatic and are not associated with systemic symptoms. In \\nprimary infection, viral shedding lasts an average of 11 days, \\nand the entire course from vesicle and ulcer onset resolves \\nover 20 days. In recurrent disease, virus shedding lasts for an \\naverage of 4 days, and the course resolves over 9-10 days. Many \\npersons experience 4-6 recurrences per year. Some primary \\nand many recurrent episodes are asymptomatic.\\nViral cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are \\nthe preferred methods of diagnosis; culture typically shows \\ncytopathic effect in 1-3 days and seldom takes longer than 5 \\ndays. PCR assays have increased sensitivity over culture. Viral \\nshedding is intermittent after primary infection, so both culture \\nand PCR can fail to detect latent infection. Serological testing \\nis useful for primary infection only (to show seroconversion \\nbetween acute and convalescent sera), and positive serologies \\npersist lifelong. Titers are not helpful in guiding management \\nof recurrences.\\nOral famciclovir and valacyclovir are effective treatments in \\nreducing the severity and duration of symptoms in primary cases \\nand may reduce recurrences. Once-daily suppressive therapy \\nreduces the frequency of genital herpes recurrences by >75%, \\nand lesions tend to be mild when they do occur. Local hygiene \\nand sitz baths may relieve discomfort. The use of condoms \\nprovides some protection against sexual transmission of HSV .\\nTRICHOMONIASIS (TRICHOMONAS \\nVAGINALIS)\\nmanifested as fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a dis-\\nseminated maculopapular rash that is also present on the palms \\nand soles. Plaque-like skin lesions, condylomata lata, and \\nmucous membrane lesions occur, particularly in moist areas \\naround the vulva and anus, and are infectious. Secondary syphilis \\nresolves spontaneously within 3-12 weeks. Tertiary syphilis is \\na slowly progressive disease involving the cardiovascular, \\nneurological, and musculoskeletal systems that manifests 15-30 \\nyears after initial infection. Latent syphilis is an asymptomatic \\ninfection detected by serological testing. Early latent syphilis \\nindicates acquisition within the preceding year; all other cases \\nof latent syphilis are designated as either late latent syphilis or \\nlatent syphilis of unknown duration. Infection can be passed \\nfrom pregnant women to infect their infants, resulting in \\ncongenital syphilis (see Chapter 66).\\nThe diagnosis of syphilis is based on serological testing. There \\nare different types of serological tests for syphilis, and both are \\nrequired to make a diagnosis: nontreponemal antibody tests: the \\nVenereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, the rapid \\nplasma reagin (RPR) test; specific treponemal antibody tests: \\nthe microhemagglutination assay–T. pallidum (MHA-TP), the \\nfluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test, \\nvarious enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), and chemiluminescence \\nimmunoassays. The syphilis screening algorithm starts with \\na screening-specific treponemal EIA or chemiluminescence \\nimmunoassay. Screening with specific treponemal antibody \\ntests will identify persons with active disease but will also be \\npositive in persons who were previously adequately treated for \\nsyphilis, those with incompletely treated syphilis, and those with \\nfalse-positive results. Positive treponemal screening antibody \\ntests should be followed by a nontreponemal test with titer. \\nThe titer can help guide management, as it increases with \\nincreasing duration of infection and decreases in response to \\ntherapy. Negative nontreponemal tests should be confirmed \\nwith a different treponemal test to confirm the results of the \\ninitial treponemal test. A nonquantitative VDRL test can be \\nperformed on cerebrospinal fluid but is insensitive. Rheumatic \\ndisease and other infectious diseases may cause false-positive \\nVDRL results. Dark-field examination of chancres, mucous \\nmembranes, or cutaneous lesions may reveal motile organisms.\\nThe treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis is parenteral \\npenicillin G. Primary syphilis, secondary syphilis, and early latent \\nsyphilis are treated with a single IM dose of benzathine penicillin \\nG. Tertiary, late latent, and latent syphilis of unknown duration \\nare treated with three doses at 1-week intervals.

Subacute osteomyelitis may also follow local \\ninoculation by penetrating trauma and is not associated with \\nsystemic symptoms; chronic osteomyelitis results from an \\nuntreated or inadequately treated (usually subacute) \\nosteomyelitis.\\nIn children beyond the newborn period and without \\nhemoglobinopathies, bone infections occur almost exclusively \\nin the metaphyses of long bones due to sluggish blood flow \\nthrough tortuous vascular loops unique to this site. Preceding \\nnonpenetrating trauma is often reported and may lead to local \\nbone injury that predisposes to infection. Bone infections in \\nchildren with sickle cell disease occur in the diaphyseal portion \\nof the long bones, probably as a consequence of antecedent \\nfocal infarction. In children younger than 12-18 months of \\nage, capillaries perforate the epiphyseal growth plate, permit-\\nting spread of infection across the epiphysis and leading to \\nsuppurative arthritis, whereas in older children, infection is \\ncontained in the metaphysis because these vessels no longer \\ncross the epiphyseal plate (Fig. 117.1A and B).\\nStaphylococcus aureus is responsible for more than 80% \\nof acute skeletal infections. Other common causes include \\ngroup A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Neisseria \\nmeningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bartonella henselae, \\nActinomyces spp., and anaerobes are less common causes. Group \\nB streptococcus and enteric gram-negatives are other major \\ncauses in neonates. Sickle cell disease and other hemoglo-\\nbinopathies predispose to osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella \\nand S. aureus. Pasteurella multocida osteomyelitis may follow \\ncat or dog bites. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \\ntesting reveals that a significant proportion of culture-negative \\nosteomyelitis is due to Kingella kingae, particularly in children \\nunder 5 years of age. Conjugate vaccine has greatly reduced the \\nincidence of Haemophilus influenzae type b infections.\\nSubacute focal bone infections caused by Pseudomonas aeru-\\nginosa and S. aureus usually occur in ambulatory persons who \\nsustain puncture wounds of the foot. Pseudomonas chondritis \\nis strongly associated with puncture wounds through sneakers, \\nwhich harbor Pseudomonas in the foam insole. S. aureus is the \\nmost common cause of chronic osteomyelitis. Chronic recurrent \\nmultifocal osteomyelitis is an autoinflammatory noninfectious \\nsyndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, bone \\npain, and radiographic findings of osteomyelitis. Bones uncom-\\nmonly involved in acute hematogenous osteomyelitis—such as \\nSymptomatic females have vaginitis, with thin, malodorous, \\nfrothy yellow-green discharge, vulvar irritation, and cervical \\n“strawberry hemorrhages” (see Table 116.3). Diagnosis is based \\non visualization of motile, flagellated protozoans in the urine \\nor in a saline wet mount, which has a sensitivity of only 60-70% \\namong symptomatic women. T. vaginalis–specific NAAT is \\navailable for testing vaginal, endocervical, and urine samples \\nand is highly sensitive (95-100%) and specific (95-100%). Rapid \\npoint-of-care testing has become available in recent years, with \\na turnaround time of approximately 10 minutes. Treatment of \\nsexual partners with oral metronidazole or tinidazole in a single \\ndose is recommended.\\nGENITAL WARTS (HUMAN \\nPAPILLOMAVIRUSES)\\nHPV , the cause of genital warts (condylomata acuminata), is \\nthe most common STI in the United States, with the highest \\nprevalence rates among 15- to 24-year-olds. Most HPV infections \\nare asymptomatic or subclinical (90%) and self-resolve within \\n2 years. HPV types 6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts and \\nare nononcogenic. HPV types 16 and 18 are associated with \\n70% of cases of cervical cancer. HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and \\n58 are also oncogenic.\\nGenital warts can occur on the squamous epithelium or \\nmucous membranes of the genital and perineal structures of \\nfemales and males (see Table 116.4). Genital warts are usually \\nmultiple, firm, gray-to-pink excrescences. Untreated genital \\nwarts may remain unchanged, increase in size or number, or \\nresolve spontaneously. Warts can become tender if macerated \\nor secondarily infected. The diagnosis is usually established by \\nappearance without biopsy. The differential diagnosis includes \\ncondylomata lata (secondary syphilis) and tumors.\\nThe goal of treatment is removal of symptomatic warts to \\ninduce wart-free periods. Treatment modalities involve destruc-\\ntion of infected epithelium; patient-applied therapies include \\npodofilox, sinecatechins, or imiquimod; and provider-applied \\ntherapies include cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe \\nand trichloroacetic acid or bichloroacetic acid. An alternative \\nis surgical removal. Intralesional interferon and laser surgery \\nhave also been effective. Factors that may influence selection \\nof treatment include wart number, size, anatomical sites, wart \\nmorphology, patient preference, treatment cost, convenience, \\nadverse effects, and provider experience. Recurrences after \\ntreatment are common and are frequently asymptomatic.\\nPUBIC LICE (PHTHIRUS PUBIS)\\nPubic lice, or pediculosis pubis, are caused by infestation with \\nPhthirus pubis, the pubic crab louse. The louse is predominantly \\nsexually transmitted and lives out its life cycle on pubic hair, \\nwhere it causes characteristic, intense pruritus (see Table 116.4). \\nDiagnosis can be made clinically; lice are visible to the naked \\neye. Erythematous papules and egg cases (nits) are not seen \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The value of \\noral prophylactic antibiotics for preventing osteomyelitis after \\npenetrating injury is uncertain.\\nCHAPTER 118 \\nInfectious Arthritis\\nETIOLOGY\\nInfectious arthritis (suppurative or septic arthritis) is a serious \\nbacterial infection of the joint space resulting from hematog -\\nenous bacterial dissemination. Infectious arthritis less often \\nresults from contiguous spread of infection from surrounding \\nsoft tissues or direct inoculation into the joint (penetrating \\ntrauma). Spread of osteomyelitis into the joint space is more \\ncommon in children under 18 months of age and occurs via \\norganisms passing through transphyseal vessels to the epiphysis \\n(see Fig. 117.1A). The bacteria causing infectious arthritis are \\nsimilar to those causing osteomyelitis (Table 118.1). Lyme disease \\nmay also cause arthritis (see Chapter 122).\\nThe arthritis of disseminated gonococcal infections \\nincludes both reactive and suppurative forms in early and late \\ngonococcal disease, respectively. With untreated genital infec-\\ntion, gonococcemia may occur with fever and a polyarticular, \\nsymmetric arthritis and rash, known as the arthritis-dermatitis \\nsyndrome. Bacterial cultures of the synovium are sterile at \\nthis stage, despite a relatively high prevalence of bacteremia. \\nMonarticular arthritis of large, weight-bearing joints develops \\ndays to weeks later. Cultures of affected synovial fluid at this \\nstage often yield the pathogen.\\nReactive arthritis is immune-mediated synovial inflamma-\\ntion that follows a bacterial or viral infection, especially with \\nChlamydia trachomatis, Yersinia, and other enteric infections. \\nReactive arthritis of the hip joints in children 3-6 years of age \\nis known as toxic or transient synovitis (see Chapter 200).\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nInfectious arthritis occurs most commonly in children younger \\nthan 5 years of age and adolescents.\\nTABLE 118.1 Pathogenic Organisms Causing Arthritis in \\nChildren\\nCOMMON UNCOMMON\\nYOUNG INFANT (<2 MO)\\nGroup B streptococci Neisseria gonorrhoeae\\nStaphylococcus aureus Candida\\nEscherichia coli\\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\\nOLDER INFANTS AND CHILDREN (2 MO TO MATURITY)\\nS. aureus Anaerobic bacteria\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa\\nGroup A streptococci Enterobacteriaceae\\nKingella kingae Haemophilus influenzae type b*\\nN. gonorrhoeae Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\nBorrelia burgdorferi (Lyme \\ndisease)\\nREACTIVE ARTHRITIS\\nYersinia enterocolitica\\nCampylobacter jejuni\\nShigella flexneri\\nChlamydia trachomatis\\nSalmonella\\nGroup A streptococci\\nNeisseria meningitidis\\nCoccidioides immitis\\nRubella virus\\n*The incidence of invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b \\nhas diminished greatly with universal childhood Hib vaccination.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLimp\\nArthritis\\nKnee Pain\\nExtremity Pain\\nThe typical features of suppurative arthritis include monarticular \\ninvolvement with erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness \\nover the affected joint with a palpable effusion and markedly \\ndecreased range of movement secondary to pain.

With \\ninsertion of the joint capsule below the epiphysis in these \\nSmall joints, such as those of the hand, are usually involved \\nafter penetrating trauma or closed fist injuries.\\nMinor genital tract symptoms that have been ignored may \\nprecede development of the early arthritis–dermatitis syndrome \\nassociated with disseminated gonococcal infection. A history \\nof febrile illness antedating the development of monarticular \\narthritis characterizes late gonococcal arthritis.\\nReactive arthritis is typically symmetric and polyarticular, and \\nit usually involves the large joints, especially the hips. Patients \\nmay have had a preceding episode of gastroenteritis or urethritis. \\nUrethritis may appear with the arthritis.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nLeukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate \\n(ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are common. Arthrocentesis \\nis important to distinguish among the causes of arthritis (Table \\n118.2). Adolescents with acute infectious arthritis should have \\nurethral, cervical, rectal, and pharyngeal examinations and \\ncultures or nucleic acid amplification tests performed for Neis-\\nseria gonorrhoeae.\\nBlood or joint cultures are positive in approximately 50% \\nof cases. Joint fluid that exhibits the characteristics of pyogenic \\ninfection may not reveal bacterial pathogens, even in the absence \\nof preceding antibiotic therapy, because of the bacteriostatic \\neffects of synovial fluid. Gram stain should be performed and is \\noften informative even if the cultures are negative. PCR testing \\nfor Kingella is essential in all culture-negative samples.\\nUltrasound is especially useful for identifying joint effusions \\nand is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating \\nsuppurative infections of the hip.

The major \\ncomplications of neonatal, childhood, and gonococcal arthritis \\nare loss of joint function resulting from damage to the articular \\nsurface. The highest incidence of these complications occurs \\nwith hip and shoulder infections, presumably resulting from \\navascular necrosis. The high incidence of concurrent suppurative \\narthritis with adjacent osteomyelitis in neonates places the \\nepiphyseal growth plate at high risk for growth abnormalities. \\nNeonates with osteomyelitis have an approximately 40-50% \\nlikelihood of growth disturbances with loss of longitudinal bone \\ngrowth and ultimate limb shortening.\\nPREVENTION\\nThere are no effective means of preventing hematogenous S. \\naureus arthritis. Universal immunization of infants with \\nconjugate Hib vaccine has practically eliminated serious bacterial \\ninfections from this organism, including bone and joint \\ninfections.\\nCHAPTER 119 \\nOcular Infections\\nETIOLOGY\\nAcute conjunctivitis is usually a viral or bacterial infection \\nof the eye characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms that \\npersist for a few days. Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae, \\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis account \\nfor approximately two thirds of bacterial causes (Table 119.1). \\nOther causes include Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Pseudomonas \\naeruginosa; the latter is associated with extended-wear soft  \\ncontact lenses. Bartonella henselae can cause a granulomatous \\nconjunctivitis associated with preauricular lymphadenopathy or \\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome. Viral conjunctivitis most \\ncommonly is caused by adenoviruses, which cause epidemic \\nkeratoconjunctivitis, and less frequently by coxsackieviruses and \\nother enteroviruses. Keratitis, or inflammation of the cornea, \\nis not commonly associated with conjunctivitis but occurs with \\nN. gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and adenovirus  \\ninfections.\\nNeonatal conjunctivitis, or ophthalmia neonatorum, is puru-\\nlent conjunctivitis during the first month of life, usually acquired \\nduring birth. The common causes of neonatal conjunctivitis, \\nin order of decreasing prevalence, are chemical conjunctivitis \\nsecondary to silver nitrate gonococcal prophylaxis, Chlamydia \\ntrachomatis, common bacterial causes of conjunctivitis, Esch -\\nerichia coli, other gram-negative enteric bacilli, HSV , and N. \\ngonorrhoeae.\\nball-and-socket joints, increased pressure in the joint space \\ncan adversely affect the vascular supply to the head of the femur \\nor humerus, leading to avascular necrosis. Infections of the \\nknee may be treated with repeated arthrocenteses in addition \\nto appropriate parenteral antibiotics.\\nSeveral antimicrobial agents provide adequate antibiotic \\nlevels in joint spaces (Table 118.3). Initial therapy for neonates \\nshould include antibiotics such as nafcillin and cefotaxime with \\nactivity against S. aureus, group B streptococcus, and aerobic \\ngram-negative rods. Initial therapy for children 3 months to \\n5 years old should include antibiotics with activity against S. \\naureus. Addition of appropriate antibiotics should be considered \\nif the child is unimmunized against Haemophilus influenzae type \\nb (Hib). Confirmed methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infections \\nare best treated with nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin initially; \\nmethicillin-resistant S. aureus infections are best treated with \\nclindamycin if susceptible or vancomycin otherwise.\\nThe duration of therapy depends on clinical resolution \\nof fever and pain and decline of the ESR and CRP . Infection \\nwith virulent organisms, such as S. aureus, usually necessitates \\ntreatment for at least 21 days, although shorter courses of 10-14 \\ndays have been used in some circumstances. Treatment may \\nbe transitioned to oral antibiotics if adherence can be ensured. \\nTABLE 118.3 Recommended Antibiotic Therapy for \\nInfectious Arthritis in Children\\nAGE GROUP\\nCOMMON \\nPATHOGENS\\nRECOMMENDED \\nTREATMENT*\\nInfants (younger \\nthan 2 mo of age)\\nGroup B \\nstreptococci\\nAmpicillin plus \\naminoglycoside\\nEscherichia coli Cefotaxime with or \\nwithout aminoglycoside\\nKlebsiella \\npneumoniae\\nCefotaxime with or \\nwithout aminoglycoside\\nStaphylococcus \\naureus\\nNafcillin (or oxacillin or \\ncefazolin), or \\nclindamycin or \\nvancomycin\\nOlder infants and \\nchildren\\nS. aureus Nafcillin (or oxacillin or \\ncefazolin), or \\nclindamycin or \\nvancomycin\\nStreptococcus \\npneumoniae\\nAmpicillin or cefotaxime \\n(or ceftriaxone) or \\nvancomycin\\nGroup A \\nstreptococci\\nPenicillin G\\nKingella kingae Amoxacillin, ampicillin, \\nor cefotaxime\\nHaemophilus \\ninfluenzae type b†\\nAmpicillin or cefotaxime \\nor ceftriaxone\\nNeisseria \\ngonorrhoeae: \\ndisseminated \\ngonococcal \\ninfection\\nCeftriaxone\\n*Use the narrowest-spectrum agent available based on organism’s \\nsusceptibilities.\\n†The incidence of invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b \\nhas diminished greatly with universal childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b \\nvaccination.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Physical examination \\nfindings include chemosis, injection of the conjunctiva, and \\nedema of the eyelids. Corneal involvement suggests gonococ-\\ncal or herpetic infection. Herpetic corneal lesions appear as \\ndendritic or ameboid ulcers or, more commonly, in recurrent \\ninfection, as a deep keratitis. Unilateral conjunctivitis with \\nipsilateral otitis media is often caused by nontypable H.  \\ninfluenzae.\\nThe timing and manifestations of neonatal conjunctivitis are \\nhelpful in identifying the cause (Table 119.2). N. gonorrhoeae \\ncauses severe conjunctivitis with profuse purulent discharge. \\nChlamydial conjunctivitis usually occurs in the second week \\nof life but may appear 3 days to 6 weeks after delivery. There is \\nmild to moderate inflammation with purulent discharge issuing \\nfrom one or both eyes.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nCultures are not routinely obtained because bacterial conjunc-\\ntivitis is usually self-limited or responds quickly to topical \\nantibiotic treatment. If gonococcal conjunctivitis is suspected, \\nespecially in neonates, Gram stain and culture must be obtained. \\nIn these infants, blood and other sites of infection (such as \\ncerebrospinal fluid) should also be cultured. Additional testing \\nfor Chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and \\nsyphilis should be performed on the mother and infant as \\nnecessary.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDistinguishing bacterial from viral conjunctivitis by presentation \\nand appearance is difficult (see Table 119.1). Vesicular lid lesions, \\nif present, suggest HSV . Hyperpurulent conjunctivitis character-\\nized by reaccumulation of purulent discharge within minutes \\nis characteristic of N. gonorrhoeae infection. The differential \\ndiagnosis is delineated in Table 119.3.\\nBlepharitis is associated with staphylococcal infections, \\nseborrhea, and meibomian gland dysfunction. The child com-\\nplains of photophobia, burning, irritation, and a foreign body \\nsensation that causes the child to rub the eyes. Eyelid hygiene \\nwith an eyelid scrub routine is the initial step in treatment.\\nHordeola are acute suppurative nodular inflammatory \\nlesions of the eyelids associated with pain and redness. External \\nhordeola or styes occur on the anterior eyelid, in the Zeis glands, \\nor in the lash follicles and usually are caused by staphylococci. \\nInternal hordeola occur in the meibomian glands and may be \\ninfected with staphylococci or may be sterile. If the meibomian \\ngland becomes obstructed, the gland secretions accumulate, and \\na chalazion develops. Hordeola usually respond spontaneously \\nto local treatment measures, but may recur.\\nDacryocystitis is an infection or inflammation of the lacrimal \\nsac, which is usually obstructed, and is most commonly caused \\nby Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. A \\nmucopurulent discharge can be expressed with gentle pressure \\non the nasolacrimal sac. Treatment usually requires probing of \\nthe nasolacrimal system to establish communication.\\nEndophthalmitis is an emergent, sight-threatening infection \\nthat usually follows trauma, surgery, or hematogenous spread \\nfrom a distant focus. Causative organisms include coagulase-\\nnegative staphylococci, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, \\nand Candida albicans. Examination is difficult because of severe \\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nConjunctivitis is common in young children, especially if they \\ncome in contact with other children with conjunctivitis. Pre-\\ndisposing factors for bacterial infection include nasolacrimal \\nduct obstruction, sinus disease, ear infection, and allergic disease \\nwhen children rub their eyes frequently.

Chlamydial conjunctivitis may progress \\nin infants to chlamydial pneumonia, which typically develops \\nfrom 2-18 weeks of age (see Chapter 110).\\nPREVENTION\\nCareful hand washing is important to prevent spread of con-\\njunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is considered contagious for \\n24 hours after initiating effective treatment. Children may return \\nto school, but treatment measures must be continued until \\nthere is complete clinical resolution.\\nAll newborns, whether delivered vaginally or by cesarean \\nsection, should receive prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthal -\\nmia neonatorum as soon as possible after delivery. A single \\napplication of erythromycin 0.5% ointment is used most \\noften. Alternative methods include tetracycline 1% ointment \\nand silver nitrate 1% solution. These are equally effective in \\npreventing gonococcal ophthalmia, but silver nitrate usually \\ncauses a chemical conjunctivitis. Neither silver nitrate solution \\nnor tetracycline ophthalmic ointment is manufactured in the \\nUnited States currently. Erythromycin ointment does not prevent \\nchlamydial ophthalmia.\\nblepharospasm and extreme photophobia. A hypopyon and \\nhaze in the anterior chamber may be visible on examination.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe lids should be treated as needed with warm compresses \\nto remove accumulated discharge. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis \\nis frequently self-limited, but topical antibiotics hasten resolution. \\nAntibiotics are instilled between the eyelids four times a day \\nuntil the discharge and chemosis subside. Recommended \\ntreatment includes topical trimethoprim-polymyxin B solution, \\nsulfacetamide 5% solution, or erythromycin ointment. Cipro-\\nfloxacin solution should be restricted to corneal infections and \\nresistant gram-negative infections in hospitalized patients. \\nGonococcal conjunctivitis in adults is treated with a single \\nintramuscular (IM) dose of ceftriaxone (1 g) p lus azithromycin \\n(1 g in a sin gle dose, to treat possible concomitant chlamydial \\ninfection and cover for the possibility of antimicrobial resistance \\nto ceftriaxone).\\nThe treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum depends on the \\ncause (see Table 119.2). Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum is \\ntreated with a single dose of ceftriaxone (25-50 m g/kg intrave-\\nnous [IV] or IM; maximum dose 125 m g). These infants should \\nbe hospitalized. Antibiotic treatment also is recommended for \\ninfants born to mothers with untreated gonorrhea. Chlamydial \\nconjunctivitis is treated with oral erythromycin for 14 days, \\npartly to reduce the risk of subsequent chlamydial pneumonia.\\nTABLE 119.2 Clinical Manifestations and Treatment of Neonatal Conjunctivitis\\nETIOLOGICAL \\nAGENT CASES (%)\\nDISCHARGE AND \\nEXTERNAL \\nEXAMINATION\\nTYPICAL \\nAGE AT \\nONSETDIAGNOSIS\\nASSOCIATED \\nMANIFESTATIONSTREATMENT\\nChemical: silver \\nnitrate\\nVariable (1%), \\ndepending on use \\nof silver nitrate\\nWatery discharge 1-3 days No organisms on \\nsmear or culture\\nNone None\\nChlamydia \\ntrachomatis \\n(inclusion \\nconjunctivitis)\\n2-40 Scant discharge; mild \\nswelling; hyperemia; \\nfollicular response; late \\ncorneal staining\\n4-19 days Test of discharge \\nwith a DIF test or \\nPCR assay\\nMay presage C. \\ntrachomatis \\npneumonia (at \\n3 wk-3 mo of age)\\nErythromycin \\n(oral)\\nBacterial: \\nStaphylococcus, \\nStreptococcus, \\nPseudomonas, \\nE. coli\\n30-50 Purulent moderate \\ndischarge; mild lid and \\nconjunctival swelling; \\ncorneal involvement with \\nrisk for perforation\\n2-7 days Gram stain; \\nculture on blood \\nagar\\nTopical \\ntherapy\\nNeisseria \\ngonorrhoeae\\n<1 Copious, purulent \\ndischarge; swelling of \\nlids and conjunctivae; \\ncorneal involvement \\ncommon; risk for \\nperforation and corneal \\nscar\\n1-7 days Gram stain \\n(gram-negative \\nintracellular \\ndiplococci); \\nculture on \\nchocolate agar. \\nCulture other \\nsites including \\nblood and CSF\\nMay be associated \\nwith severe \\ndisseminated \\ngonococcal \\ninfection\\nCeftriaxone\\nHospitalize \\npatient\\nHSV <1 Clear or \\nserosanguineous \\ndischarge; lid swelling; \\nkeratitis with cloudy \\ncornea; dendrite \\nformation\\n3 days-3 wk Viral culture; DIF \\ntest, PCR assay\\nMay be associated \\nwith disseminated \\nperinatal HSV \\ninfection\\nAcyclovir \\n(intravenous)\\nCSF, Cerebrospinal fluid; DIF, direct immunofluorescence; HSV, herpes simplex virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) \\ncan also cause focal or systemic disease in immunocompromised \\npersons, especially in transplant patients. Manifestations of CMV \\ndisease include retinitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, esophagitis, \\nencephalitis, and colitis. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \\nis associated with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder \\n(PTLD). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause serious primary \\ninfection in susceptible persons, sometimes with accompanying \\nencephalitis, hepatitis, or pneumonitis. VZV can also reactivate \\nas shingles during chemotherapy and may cause disseminated \\ninfection.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nChemotherapeutic agents target rapidly dividing cells, especially \\nmyeloproliferative cells, which causes myelosuppression. \\nChildren receiving allogeneic transplants are at greater risk for \\ninfection than children receiving autologous transplants. \\nProlonged time to hematological engraftment is a significant \\nrisk factor for infection in these patients (Fig. 120.1). Foreign \\nbodies (shunts, central venous catheters) and mucositis interfere \\nwith cutaneous barriers against infection and, together with \\nneutropenia and/or lymphopenia, increase the risk of bacterial \\nor fungal infections. Multiple antimicrobial exposures put these \\npatients at risk for resistant bacterial, fungal, and viral \\ninfections.\\nThe relative rate of some infection in patients with cancer \\nis 10-15%. The most frequently infected sites, in descending \\norder, are the respiratory tract (lung, sinuses), the bloodstream, \\nsurgical wounds, and the urinary tract.\\nimpair the activation of T lymphocytes increases the risk for \\npathogens normally controlled by T cell–mediated responses, \\nsuch as Pneumocystis jiroveci and Toxoplasma gondii, as well \\nas intracellular pathogens, such as Salmonella, Listeria, and \\nMycobacterium.

Organisms most commonly isolated in this case \\ninclude coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, gram-\\nnegative bacteria, Enterococcus, and Candida (see Chapter 121).\\nFungal pathogens account for approximately 10% of all \\ninfections associated with childhood cancer. Candida species are \\nthe most common cause of all fungal infections, with Aspergillus \\nbeing the second most common pathogen. Other risk factors \\nfor fungal infections include oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal \\nmucositis facilitating systemic fungal invasion, presence of long-\\nterm indwelling intravascular catheters, parenteral nutrition, \\nhyperglycemia, extreme prematurity, and broad-spectrum \\nantibacterial therapy that promotes fungal colonization as a \\nprecursor to infection.\\nInfection with T. gondii represents reactivation of quiescent \\ninfection facilitated by cancer-associated or therapy-associated \\ncellular immunodeficiency.

Chest \\nradiographs are important to assess for the presence of pul-\\nmonary infiltrates.

Sinus \\ninfection with bacteria, Aspergillus, or Zygomycetes is common \\nin neutropenic hosts and may be detected only on the CT scan. \\nViruses can be detected in blood, respiratory samples, cere-\\nbrospinal fluid, and skin lesions by polymerase chain reaction \\n(PCR).\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nInitially the patient should have a complete physical examination, \\nincluding careful scrutiny of the oropharynx, nares, external \\nauditory canals, skin and axilla, groin, perineum, and rectal \\narea. The exit site and subcutaneous tunnel of any indwelling \\nvascular catheter should be examined closely for erythema and \\npalpated for tenderness and expression of purulent material. \\nPerirectal abscess is a potentially serious infection in neutropenic \\nhosts, with tenderness being the only clue on examination. \\nAny presumptive infection identified during the evaluation \\nshould direct appropriate cultures and tailor anti-infective \\ntherapy.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment should be provided as appropriate for focal infections \\nidentified by physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Select \\nlow-risk patients may be managed as outpatients. Empirical \\ntreatment of fever and neutropenia without an identified source \\nshould include an extended-spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin \\nwith activity against gram-negative bacilli, including P . aeru-\\nginosa. If the patient has an indwelling vascular catheter, \\nvancomycin may be added because of the increasing prevalence \\nof methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) but can be discon-\\ntinued if S. aureus is not cultured after 48-72 hours. Specific \\nantibiotic regimens should be guided by local antibiotic \\nresistance patterns at each institution.\\nIf no microbiologic cause is isolated, empirical broad-\\nspectrum antibiotics are continued as long as the patient remains \\nneutropenic, regardless of whether the fever resolves. Antibiotic \\ntherapy should be modified as indicated by new findings or if \\nthe patient’s clinical status deteriorates. Further investigation for \\nfungal infection and empirical treatment with antifungal agents \\nis instituted in patients who have neutropenia and persistent \\nfever without a focus, despite broad-spectrum antibacterial \\ntherapy for approximately 5 days.\\nPREVENTION\\nCurrent guidelines discourage the use of broad-spectrum \\nprophylactic antibiotics to prevent fever and neutropenia because \\nof lack of efficacy and concerns about development of antibiotic \\nresistance.

Confirmation requires quantitative colony counts \\nof both samples, which is not routinely performed. Possible \\nsources of the bacteremia include the infusate, contamination \\nvia tubing and catheter connections, or transient bacteremia \\nseeding the catheter, which may or may not be clinically appar-\\nent. Infection may be associated with an exit site infection \\nlimited to the insertion site or may extend along the catheter \\ntunnel of buried catheters to cause a tunnel infection. Given the \\nproximity of central venous catheters to cardiac valves, persistent \\ncentral infections can also be complicated by endocarditis. An \\nechocardiogram should be considered in patients with persistent \\nbacteremia related to a central line (see Chapter 111).\\nMany microorganisms cause catheter-related infections (Table \\n121.1). Gram-positive cocci, primarily staphylococci, cause more \\nthan 50% of CLABSIs and exit site infections. Other skin flora, \\nsuch as coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids, and \\nBacillus are often involved. Gram-negative organisms also \\ncommonly cause infection. Polymicrobial infections of central \\nvenous catheters are common. Fungal catheter infections, usually \\nCandida species, are most common among persons receiving \\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics or parenteral nutrition.\\nRisk factors for CLABSI include prematurity, burns and skin \\ndisorders that adversely affect the skin integrity, neutropenia, \\nand other immunodeficiencies (see Chapter 120). Infection \\nrates are lower for tunneled and implanted catheters. Catheters \\ninserted in emergency settings are more likely to be infected \\nthan catheters placed electively.\\nClinical signs of catheter-associated bacteremia or fungemia \\nrange from mild fever to overwhelming sepsis. Infection at the \\nsite of the central catheter entrance is manifested as a localized \\ncellulitis with warmth, tenderness, swelling, erythema, and \\ndischarge. Tunnel infection is manifested by similar findings \\nalong the tunnel route.

In select populations, such as patients undergo-\\ning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, prophylactic \\nantifungals such as fluconazole or voriconazole are beneficial. \\nPatients at risk for viral reactivation with HSV , VZV , and/or \\nCMV may be placed on antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir \\nor ganciclovir.\\nImmunocompromised susceptible persons exposed to \\nchickenpox within 2 days before the onset of rash until 5 \\ndays after the onset of rash in the index case should receive \\nvaricella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). Modified infection \\nafter VZIG may not result in protective immunity, and persons \\nwho receive VZIG prophylaxis should be considered still at \\nrisk with any subsequent exposures.\\nCHAPTER 121 \\nInfections Associated With \\nMedical Devices\\nInfections are a common and important complication of \\nindwelling medical devices and are a major part of health \\ncare–associated infections (formerly known as nosocomial \\ninfections).\\nVASCULAR DEVICE INFECTIONS\\nVascular catheters are inserted in most inpatients and used \\nin many outpatients. The use of catheters for long-term access \\nto the bloodstream has been an important advance for the care \\nof persons who require parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, or \\nextended parenteral antibiotic therapy. The major complication \\nof such catheters is infection. Short, peripheral intravenous \\n(IV) catheters used for short-term access in stable patients are \\nassociated with a low rate of infection, especially in children. \\nPeripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are commonly \\nused for medium-term venous access. Central venous catheters \\nare commonly placed for extended vascular access, such as for \\nchemotherapy, using tunneled silicone elastomer catheters \\n(Broviac or Hickman catheters) that are surgically inserted \\ninto a central vein, passed through a subcutaneous tunnel before \\nexiting the skin, and anchored by a subcutaneous cuff. Con-\\ntamination of the catheter hub or any connection of the IV \\ntubing is common and is a major predisposition to catheter-\\nassociated infection. Totally implanted venous access systems \\n(Port-a-Cath, Infuse-a-Port) have a silicone elastomer catheter \\ntunneled beneath the skin to a reservoir implanted in a sub-\\ncutaneous pocket. Implanted catheters or ports decrease, but \\ndo not eliminate, the opportunity for microbial entry at the \\nskin site.\\nCatheter-related thrombosis and catheter-related infection \\ncan develop separately or together. Ultrasound can identify \\nthrombi, but infection can be identified by culture only. \\nThrombophlebitis is inflammation with thrombosis in a blood \\nvessel. Septic thrombophlebitis is thrombosis with organisms \\nembedded in the clot. Central line associated bloodstream \\ninfection (CLABSI) implies isolation of the same organism \\nfrom a catheter and from peripheral blood of a patient with \\nTABLE 121.1 Organisms Causing Catheter-Related \\nInfections\\nCLASSIFICATION \\nOF PATHOGEN COMMON UNCOMMON\\nGram-positive \\norganisms\\nCoagulase-negative \\nstaphylococci, \\nStaphylococcus \\naureus, Enterococcus\\nDiphtheroids, \\nBacillus, Micrococcus\\nGram-negative \\norganisms\\nEscherichia coli, \\nKlebsiella, \\nPseudomonas \\naeruginosa\\nAcinetobacter, \\nEnterobacter, \\nNeisseria\\nFungi Candida species Malassezia furfur\\nMiscellaneous Nontuberculous \\nmycobacteria, \\nLactobacillus\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFever and Rash\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Indwelling catheters facilitate direct \\naccess to the bladder and should have a closed drainage system. \\nAfter simple, straight catheterization, the incidence of UTI is \\n1-2%. Organisms that cause catheter-associated UTIs include \\nfecal flora, such as gram-negative enteric bacilli, most commonly \\nEscherichia coli and Enterococcus. With concomitant antibiotic \\ntreatment, resistant organisms predominate, and fungi may \\nemerge as pathogens.\\nThe most important aspect of prevention is to minimize the \\nduration and use of catheterization. Intermittent catheterization \\nis preferred over indwelling catheter drainage whenever feasible. \\nInsertion of catheters must be performed with aseptic technique, \\nand the drainage system must remain closed at all times, with \\nsterile technique used whenever the system is entered. Drainage \\nbags always should be dependent to avoid backflow of urine \\ninto the bladder.\\nPERITONEAL DIALYSIS–ASSOCIATED \\nINFECTIONS\\nIndwelling catheters used for peritoneal dialysis may develop \\nexit site infections, tunnel infections, or lead to peritonitis. \\nThe usual route of infection is from the skin surface along the \\ntunnel and into the peritoneum. The most common pathogens \\nare skin flora, including Staphylococcus species; organisms that \\ncontaminate water, such as Pseudomonas  and Acinetobacter ; \\nenteric flora, such as E. coli and Klebsiella; and fungi, such as \\nC. albicans. Peritonitis may present with fever, vague abdominal \\npain, and cloudy dialysate. The diagnosis is established on clini-\\ncal manifestations and confirmed by culture of the dialysate. \\nPrevention of infection requires careful planning of the location \\nof the exit site to minimize contamination, aseptic insertion of \\nthe catheter, meticulous care of the catheter site, securing of the \\ncatheter to avoid tension and motion, and aseptic technique \\nduring dialysis.\\nCENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SHUNTS\\nImportant risk factors of health care–associated central nervous \\nsystem (CNS) infections are surgery, presence of a ventriculo-\\nperitoneal shunt (VPS), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. \\nInfection of a VPS results from contamination of the system \\nat the time of placement, breakdown of overlying skin, or from \\nhematogenous seeding. Externalized ventricular drains and \\nsubdural bolts allow direct access of skin flora to the CSF . For \\nthese devices, the rates of infection increase with the duration \\nof catheterization, especially beyond 5 days. Device-related CNS \\ninfections can be diagnosed in the same way as other types of \\nmeningitis or ventriculitis with assessment of the CSF for \\npleocytosis, protein, glucose, and gram stain and culture.\\nThe most common pathogens causing shunt infections are \\ncoagulase-negative staphylococci and S. aureus. After skull \\nfracture or cranial surgery, a CSF leak may facilitate ascending \\ninfection from the nasopharynx, especially with Streptococcus \\npneumoniae, which frequently colonizes the nasopharynx. \\nPatients with shunt infections may present with only fever and \\nheadache or may present with typical signs and symptoms of \\nmeningitis (see Chapter 100). Infections caused by coagulase-\\nnegative staphylococci or Propionibacterium acnes typically \\nThe treatment of catheter-related infection depends on the site \\nof the infection and the pathogen involved. CLABSI is optimally \\ntreated with catheter removal; however, in a stable patient or \\nwith certain organisms, antibiotic therapy alone may suffice. \\nInfection with organisms of low virulence may be manifested \\nby fever alone, and removal of the catheter frequently is followed \\nby prompt defervescence and complete resolution of infection. \\nNonetheless many patients are dependent on the catheter and \\nremoval may be difficult. Empirical initial therapy for suspected \\ninfection should include antibiotics active against gram-negative \\norganisms such as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin and against \\nS. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci with vancomycin. \\nSubsequently, antibiotic regimens should be tailored to the \\nspecific organism identified. If the patient is not critically ill \\nand the pathogen is likely to be susceptible to antibiotic therapy, \\na trial of antibiotics is given through the infected catheter. The \\ntotal duration of therapy depends on the pathogen and the \\nduration of positive cultures and is usually 10-14 days after \\nsterilization of the bloodstream. Catheter removal is indicated \\nwith sepsis, septic thrombophlebitis, clinical deterioration \\n(despite appropriate therapy), persistently positive blood culture \\nresults after 48-72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, \\nembolic lesions, or fungal infection because of poor response \\nto antifungal therapy alone. Catheter removal is also recom-\\nmended for infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudo-\\nmonas aeruginosa. Infection of the pocket around an implanted \\nport is unlikely to respond to antibiotics alone, and removal \\nof the foreign body is usually necessary.\\nAntibiotic-lock therapy is a method of sterilizing intra -\\nvascular catheters by using high concentrations of antibiotics \\nor ethanol infused into the portion of the catheter between \\nthe hub and the vessel entry. The solution is allowed to dwell \\nwithin the catheter segment for several hours. It may be useful \\nfor treatment of catheter-associated infections in which line \\nsalvage is desired and/or for prevention of infection in patients \\nat high risk.\\nAseptic technique is essential during catheter insertion. \\nCatheters that are placed during emergency situations should \\nbe replaced as soon as medically feasible. Care of indwelling \\ncatheters involves meticulous attention to sterile technique \\nwhenever the system is entered. Care of the catheter entry site \\ncommonly involves a topical antibiotic or disinfectant. Catheters \\nthat are no longer necessary should be removed.\\nVENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA\\nIntubation of the airway provides direct access to the lungs \\nand bypasses normal host defenses. Organisms enter the lungs \\ndirectly through the lumen of the tube or by descending around \\nthe tube, which may result in ventilator-associated pneumonia. \\nContaminated respiratory equipment, humidification systems, \\nor condensate introduces bacteria directly into lower airways. \\nThe continuously open upper airway increases the risk of \\naspiration of oropharyngeal flora and reflux of gastric contents \\nand interferes with clearance of the airway because an effective \\ncough requires a closed glottis.\\nURINARY CATHETERS\\nThe most important risk factors for urinary tract infections \\n(UTIs) are the presence of catheters, instrumentation, and \\nanatomical abnormalities (see Chapter 114).

Squeezing, twisting, or crushing the tick should \\nbe avoided because the tick’s bloated abdomen can act like a \\nsyringe if squeezed. Transmission of infection seems to be most \\nefficient after 24-48 hours of nymphal tick attachment for human \\ngranulocytic ehrlichiosis, after 36 hours for B. burgdorferi, and \\nafter 36-48 hours for Babesia.

Early localized \\ndisease develops 7-14 days after a tick bite as the site forms \\nan erythematous papule that expands to form a red, raised \\nborder, often with central clearing (Fig. 122.2). The lesion, \\nerythema migrans, is pruritic or painful, harbors B. burgdorferi, \\nand, without treatment, may expand to as much as 15  cm in \\ndiameter. Systemic manifestations may include malaise, lethargy, \\nfever, headache, arthralgias, stiff neck, myalgias, and lymph-\\nadenopathy. The skin lesions and early manifestations resolve \\nwithout treatment over 2-4 weeks. Not all patients with Lyme \\ndisease recall a tick bite or develop erythema migrans.\\nApproximately 25% of children with Lyme disease are \\ninitially diagnosed with early disseminated disease, which is \\na consequence of bacteremic dissemination of B. burgdorferi \\nto multiple sites. Early disseminated disease is character -\\nized by multiple secondary skin lesions, aseptic meningitis, \\npseudotumor, papilledema, neuropathies including Bell palsy, \\npolyradiculitis, peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, \\nor transverse myelitis. Carditis with various degrees of heart \\nblock rarely may develop during this stage. Neurological mani-\\nfestations usually resolve by 3 months but may recur or become  \\nchronic.\\nLate disease begins weeks to months after infection and is \\ndiagnosed in approximately 7% of children at initial presentation. \\nArthritis is the usual manifestation and may develop in 50-60% \\nof untreated patients. The knee is involved in greater than 90% \\nof cases, but any joint may be affected. Symptoms may resolve \\nover 1-2 weeks but often recur in other joints. Neuroborreliosis, \\nthe late manifestations of Lyme disease involving the central \\nnervous system (CNS), is rarely reported in children.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nAntibody tests during early, localized Lyme disease may be \\nnegative and are not useful. Additionally, patients appropriately \\ntreated for their early, localized Lyme disease may not develop \\na positive antibody test. The diagnosis of late disease is confirmed \\nFIGURE 122.2  Expanding annular lesion of erythema migrans at \\nthe site of a tick bite. (Courtesy Dr. Jay Capra, Abilene, Texas.)\\nLYME DISEASE (BORRELIA BURGDORFERI)\\nEtiology\\nLyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete, \\nB. burgdorferi. The vector in the eastern and midwestern United \\nStates is Ixodes scapularis , the black-legged tick that is com-\\nmonly known as the deer tick. The vector on the Pacific coast \\nis Ixodes pacificus, the western black-legged tick. Ticks usually \\nbecome infected by feeding on the white-footed mouse (Pero-\\nmyscus leucopus), which is a natural reservoir for B. burgdorferi. \\nThe larvae are dormant over winter and emerge the following \\nspring in the nymphal stage, the stage of the tick that is most \\nlikely to transmit the infection to humans.\\nEpidemiology\\nOver 20,000 cases are reported annually in the United States, \\nwith >90% of cases reported from New England and the eastern \\nparts of the middle Atlantic states (Fig. 122.1). In Europe most \\ncases occur in Scandinavian countries and central Europe. \\nBecause exposure to ticks is more common in warm months, \\nLyme disease is noted predominantly in spring and summer. \\nThe incidence is highest among children 5-9 years old, at almost \\ntwice the incidence among adolescents and adults.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nArthritis\\nFever and Rash\\nReported Cases of Lyme Disease in the United States, 2014.\\n1 dot placed randomly within county\\nof residence for each confirmed case\\nFIGURE 122.1  The geographic distribution of 25,359 confirmed \\ncases of Lyme disease in the United States in 2014. The risk for acquiring \\nLyme disease varies by the distribution of Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes \\npacificus, the proportion of infected ticks for each species at each \\nstage of the tick’s life cycle, and the presence of grassy or wooded \\nlocations favored by white-tailed deer.

The long-term prognosis is excellent for \\ntreated early and late disease. Early treatment of erythema \\nmigrans almost always prevents progression to later stages. \\nRecurrences of arthritis after treatment occur in 5-10% of \\npatients. The most common reason patients “recur” or do not \\nrespond to treatment is that the initial diagnosis was \\nincorrect.\\nPrevention\\nMeasures to minimize exposure to tick-borne diseases are the \\nmost reasonable means of preventing Lyme disease. Postexposure \\nprophylaxis is not routinely recommended because the overall \\nrisk of acquiring Lyme disease after a tick bite is only 1-3% \\neven in endemic areas, and treatment of the infection, if it \\ndevelops, is highly effective. Nymphal stage ticks must feed for \\n>36 hours before the risk of transmission of B. burgdorferi  \\nfrom infected ticks becomes substantial. In hyperendemic \\nregions, prophylaxis of adults with doxycycline, 200  m g as a \\nsingle dose, within 72 hours of a nymphal tick bite is effective \\nin preventing Lyme disease.\\nROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER \\n(RICKETTSIA RICKETTSII)\\nEtiology\\nThe cause of RMSF is R. rickettsii, gram-negative coccobacillary \\norganisms that resemble bacteria but have incomplete cell walls \\nand require an intracellular site for replication. The organism \\ninvades and proliferates within the endothelial cells of blood \\nvessels of all major organs and tissues, causing vasculitis and \\nresulting in increased vascular permeability, edema, and, \\neventually, decreased vascular volume, altered tissue perfusion, \\nand widespread organ failure. Many tick species are capable of \\ntransmitting R. rickettsii. The principal ticks are the Ameri-\\ncan dog tick  (Dermacentor variabilis) in the eastern United \\nStates and Canada, the wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) \\nin the western United States and Canada, the brown dog \\ntick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) in Mexico and southwestern \\nUnited States, and Amblyomma cajennense in Central and South  \\nAmerica.\\nEpidemiology\\nRMSF is the most common rickettsial illness in the United \\nStates, occurring primarily in the eastern coastal, southeastern, \\nand south-central states. Most cases occur from April to \\nSeptember after outdoor activity in wooded areas. RMSF occurs \\nmore commonly in adults, but the case fatality rate is highest \\nin children 5-9 years of age. In approximately 50% of pediatric \\ncases of RMSF there is no recall of a tick bite.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nby serological tests specific for B. burgdorferi. The sensitivity \\nand specificity of serological tests for Lyme disease vary sub -\\nstantially. A positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or \\nimmunofluorescence assay result must be confirmed by \\nimmunoblot showing antibodies against at least either two to \\nthree (for IgM) or five (for IgG) proteins of B. burgdorferi (at \\nleast one of which is one of the more specific, low molecular weight, \\nouter-surface proteins).\\nIn late disease, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated \\nand complement may be reduced. The joint fluid shows an \\ninflammatory response with total white blood cell count of \\n25,000-125,000 cells/mm3, often with a polymorphonuclear \\npredominance (see Table 118.2). The rheumatoid factor  \\nand antinuclear antibody are negative, but the Venereal \\nDisease Research Laboratory test may be falsely positive. With \\nCNS involvement, the cerebrospinal fluid shows a lympho-\\ncytic pleocytosis with normal glucose and slightly elevated  \\nprotein.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nA history of a tick bite and the classic rash is helpful but is not \\nalways present. Erythema migrans of early, localized disease \\nmay be confused with nummular eczema, tinea corporis, \\ngranuloma annulare, an insect bite, or cellulitis. Southern \\ntick-associated rash illness (STARI) , which is similar to \\nerythema migrans but not associated with any of the dissemi-\\nnated complications of Lyme disease, occurs in southeastern \\nand south-central states and is associated with the bite of \\nAmblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, which is abundant \\nin the southern states and incapable of transmitting B. \\nburgdorferi.\\nDuring early, disseminated Lyme disease, multiple lesions \\nmay appear as erythema multiforme or urticaria. The aseptic \\nmeningitis is similar to viral meningitis, and the seventh nerve \\npalsy is indistinguishable from herpetic or idiopathic Bell palsy. \\nLyme carditis is similar to viral myocarditis. Monarticular or \\npauciarticular arthritis of late Lyme disease may mimic suppura-\\ntive arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or rheumatic fever \\n(see Chapter 89). The differential diagnosis of neuroborreliosis \\nincludes degenerative neurological illness, encephalitis, and \\ndepression.\\nTreatment\\nEarly localized disease and early disseminated disease, including \\nfacial nerve palsy (or other cranial nerve palsy) and carditis \\nwith first-degree or second-degree heart block, is treated with \\ndoxycycline or amoxicillin for 14-21 days. Early disseminated \\ndisease with carditis with third-degree heart block or meningitis \\nand late neurological disease are treated with intravenous or \\nintramuscular ceftriaxone or intravenous penicillin G for 14-28 \\ndays. Arthritis is treated with doxycycline (for children ≥8 years \\nof age) or amoxicillin for 28 days. If there is recurrence, treat-\\nment should be with a repeated oral regimen or with the regimen \\nfor late neurological disease.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nCarditis, especially conduction disturbances, and arthritis are \\nthe major complications of Lyme disease. Even untreated, most \\ncases eventually resolve without sequelae.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice, \\neven for young children, despite the theoretical risk of dental \\nstaining in children younger than 8 years of age.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nIn severe infections, capillary leakage results in noncardiogenic \\npulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome), \\nhypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, circulatory \\ncollapse, and multiple organ failure, including encephalitis, \\nmyocarditis, hepatitis, and renal failure.\\nUntreated illness may persist for 3 weeks and progress to \\nmultisystem involvement. The mortality rate is 20-80% without \\ntreatment, which is reduced to 1-3% with treatment. Permanent \\nsequelae are common after severe disease.\\nPrevention\\nPreventive measures to avoid tick-borne infections and careful \\nremoval of ticks are recommended.\\nEHRLICHIOSIS (EHRLICHIA CHAFFEENSIS) \\nAND ANAPLASMOSIS (ANAPLASMA \\nPHAGOCYTOPHILUM)\\nEtiology\\nThe term ehrlichiosis often is used to refer to all forms of \\ninfection with Ehrlichia. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis  is \\ncaused by E. chaffeensis, which infects predominantly monocytic \\ncells and is transmitted by the tick A. americanum (lone star \\ntick). Disease may also be caused by Ehrlichia ewingii (granu-\\nlocytes) and Ehrlichia muris–like agent (unknown, suspected \\nmonocytes). Human anaplasmosis is caused by A. phagocy-\\ntophilum and is transmitted by the tick I. scapularis (black-legged \\ntick) or I. pacificus (western black-legged tick).\\nEpidemiology\\nHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis occurs in broad areas across \\nthe southeastern, south-central, and mid-Atlantic United States \\nin a distribution that parallels that of RMSF . Anaplasmosis is \\nfound mostly in the northeastern and upper midwestern United \\nStates, but infections have been identified in northern California, \\nthe mid-Atlantic states, and broadly across Europe. Ehrlichiosis \\ndue to E. muris–like agents have been reported only from \\nWisconsin and Minnesota.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, and Ehrlichiosis \\newingii cause similar acute febrile illnesses characterized by \\nfever, malaise, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and nausea. Rash \\noccurs more commonly in ehrlichiosis than anaplasmosis but \\neven so is uncommon in adults. In contrast to adult patients, \\nnearly two thirds of children with human monocytic ehrlichiosis \\npresent with a macular or maculopapular rash, although \\npetechial lesions may occur. Symptoms usually last for 1-2 \\nweeks.\\nThe incubation period of RMSF is 2-14 days, with an average \\nof 7 days. The onset is nonspecific with headache, malaise, \\nand fever. A pale, rose-red macular or maculopapular rash \\nappears in 90% of cases usually 2-5 days after fever onset. The \\nearly rash blanches on pressure and is accentuated by warmth. \\nIt progresses over hours or days to a petechial and purpuric \\neruption that appears first on the feet and ankles, then the \\nwrists and hands, and progresses centripetally to the trunk and \\nhead. A hallmark feature is the involvement of the palms and \\nsoles (Fig. 122.3). Myalgias, especially of the lower extremities, \\nand intractable headaches are common. Severe cases progress \\nwith splenomegaly, myocarditis, renal impairment, pneumonitis, \\nand shock.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThrombocytopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, \\nand elevated hepatic transaminase levels are common laboratory \\nfindings. Organisms can be detected in skin biopsy specimens \\nby fluorescent antibodies or polymerase chain reaction, although \\nthis test is not widely available. Serological testing is used to \\nconfirm the diagnosis. Approximately 50% of patients will not \\nhave detectable antibody until the second week of illness, and \\ntreatment should not be withheld pending confirmation.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis includes meningococcemia, bacterial \\nsepsis, toxic shock syndrome, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, measles, \\nenteroviruses, infectious mononucleosis, collagen vascular \\ndiseases, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and idiopathic throm-\\nbocytopenic purpura. The diagnosis of RMSF should be sus-\\npected with fever and petechial rash, especially with a history \\nof a tick bite or outdoor activities during spring and summer \\nin endemic regions. Delayed diagnosis and late treatment usually \\nresult from atypical initial symptoms and late appearance of \\nthe rash.\\nFIGURE 122.3 Petechial and purpuric rash of Rocky Mountain Spotted \\nFever.

Dengue virus is most prevalent in the tropics, \\nand endogenous infections have been reported in Florida and \\nTexas.\\nInfected patients may have subclinical disease or a self-\\nlimited febrile illness. Dengue hemorrhagic fever, the most \\nsevere manifestation of the illness, occurs in patients who have \\nhad a previous Dengue virus infection (different serotype) and \\nwho manifest an exaggerated immunological response to the \\nnew Dengue virus serotype.\\nDengue viremia usually precedes the influenza-like illness \\ncharacterized by fever, myalgias, musculoskeletal pain (break \\nbone fever), headaches, macular rash, elevated liver enzymes, \\nacute respiratory distress syndrome, and peripheral cytopenias. \\nShock may occur with third space fluid losses, which may be \\nassociated with an increasing hematocrit. Epistaxis, hemoptysis, \\ngastrointestinal, and uterine bleeding may occur.\\nDiagnosis is based on the geographic epidemiology, clinical \\npresentation, and detection of dengue virus by PCR.

Malaria is an important cause of fever and \\nmorbidity in the tropical world. The principal areas of transmis-\\nsion are sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, Southeast Asia, \\nand Central and South America. Approximately 1,500-2,000 \\nimported cases are recognized annually in the United States, \\nwith most cases occurring among infected foreign civilians \\nfrom endemic areas who travel to the United States and among \\nU.S. citizens who travel to endemic areas without appropriate \\nchemoprophylaxis.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nin the “saddleback” pattern. Polyarthralgias involve the small \\njoints, which are exquisitely tender, and may persist for several \\nweeks. The rash appears as facial flushing but evolves to a \\nmaculopapular occasionally pruritic eruption on the trunk, \\nextremities, soles, and palms. Children may have CNS symptoms \\n(irritability, seizures). Leukopenia, lymphocytosis, and an \\nelevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive \\nprotein (CRP) are common.\\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by PCR or antibody responses. \\nTreatment is supportive, particularly for the incapacitating joint \\nmanifestations. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking agents \\nmay be beneficial for severe and persistent arthritis.\\nZika Virus\\nZika virus, a member of the flavivirus group, is transmitted by \\nmany Aedes mosquito species and is prevalent in equatorial \\nregions of South America and Asia. Monkeys may be the animal \\nreservoir. Zika virus infection is manifest with fever, rash, \\narthralgia, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and headache. Infection \\nin children and adults is usually self-limited; the greatest concern \\nis infection during pregnancy resulting in transplacental \\ntransmission to the fetus with subsequent severe microcephaly \\nand other congenital malformation.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by Zika virus antibody titers or  \\nPCR.\\nCHAPTER 123 \\nParasitic Diseases\\nPROTOZOAL DISEASES\\nProtozoa are the simplest organisms of the animal kingdom. \\nThey are unicellular. Most are free-living, but some have a \\ncommensal or parasitic existence. Protozoal diseases include \\nmalaria, toxoplasmosis, babesiosis, and the intestinal protozoal \\ndiseases, amebiasis, cryptosporidiosis, and giardiasis.\\nMalaria\\nEtiology\\nMalaria is caused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus \\nPlasmodium, including P . falciparum, P . malariae, P . ovale, P.  \\nvivax, and P.  k n o w l e s i. Plasmodium has a complex life cycle \\nthat enables survival in different cellular environments in the \\nhuman host and in the mosquito vector. There are two major \\nphases in the life cycle, an asexual phase (schizogony) in \\nhumans and a sexual phase (sporogony) in mosquitoes. The \\nerythrocytic phase of Plasmodium asexual development begins \\nwhen the merozoites released from exoerythrocytic schizonts \\nin the liver penetrate erythrocytes. When inside the erythrocyte, \\nthe parasite transforms into the ring form, which enlarges to \\nbecome a trophozoite. These latter two forms can be identified \\nwith Giemsa stain on blood smear, which is the primary means \\nof confirming the diagnosis of malaria.\\nThe parasites usually are transmitted to humans by female \\nAnopheles mosquitoes. Malaria also can be transmitted through \\nblood transfusion, via contaminated needles, and transplacentally \\nto a fetus.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nThe clinical manifestations of malaria range from asymptomatic \\ninfection to fulminant illness and death, depending on the \\nvirulence of the infecting malaria species and the host immune \\nresponse. The incubation period ranges from 7-30 days, depend-\\ning on the Plasmodium species (Table 123.1). The most char -\\nacteristic clinical feature of malaria, which is seldom noted \\nwith other infectious diseases, is febrile paroxysms alternating \\nwith periods of fatigue but otherwise relative wellness. The \\nclassic symptoms of the febrile paroxysms of malaria include \\nhigh fever, rigors, sweats, and headache. Paroxysms coincide \\nwith the ruptures of schizonts that occur every 48 hours with \\nP . vivax and P . ovale (tertian periodicity), every 72 hours with \\nP . malariae (quartan periodicity), and every 24 hours with P.  \\nknowlesi. Periodicity can be tertian with P . falciparum infections \\nbut is often irregular.\\nShort-term relapse describes the recurrence of symptoms \\nafter a primary attack that is due to the survival of erythrocyte \\nforms in the bloodstream. Long-term relapse describes the \\nrenewal of symptoms long after the primary attack, usually due \\nto the release of merozoites from an exoerythrocytic source in \\nthe liver. Long-term relapse occurs with P . vivax and P . ovale \\nbecause of persistence in the liver (Fig. 123.1).\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThe diagnosis of malaria is established by the identification of \\norganisms on stained smears of peripheral blood. In nonimmune \\npersons, symptoms typically occur 1-2 days before parasites \\nare detectable on blood smear. Although P . falciparum is most \\nlikely to be identified from blood during a febrile paroxysm, \\nthe timing of the smears is less important than obtaining smears \\nseveral times each day over 3 successive days. Both thick and \\nthin blood smears should be examined. The concentration of \\nerythrocytes on a thick smear is approximately 20-40 times \\ngreater than that on a thin smear. Thick smears are used to \\nscan large numbers of erythrocytes quickly. Thin smears allow \\nfor positive identification of the malaria species and determina-\\ntion of the percentage of infected erythrocytes, called parasitemia, \\nwhich also is useful in following the response to therapy. Rapid \\ndiagnostic tests are available as point-of-care tests. Such tests \\nprovide results in 15-20 minutes and are particularly useful in \\nareas where reliable microscopic diagnosis is not available.

The sporozoites \\nthen invade hepatocytes, in which they develop into schizonts. Each infected hepatocyte ruptures to \\nliberate 10,000-30,000 merozoites that invade circulating erythrocytes. Growth and development of \\nthe parasites in red cells result in subsequent waves of merozoite invasion. This asexual blood cycle \\nrepeats every 24 (Plasmodium knowlesi), 48 (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium \\novale), or 72 (Plasmodium malariae) hours, leading to amplification of parasite density; paroxysms of \\nchills, fevers, and sweats; and other manifestations of disease. Malaria symptoms are typically experienced \\n2-4 weeks after the mosquito bite. If the parasites are not cleared (e.g., patient receives partially \\neffective therapy), recrudescence of parasitemia and malaria symptoms can occur. Eradicating parasites \\nwith an effective drug regimen cures malaria. Some P. vivax and P. ovale parasites can postpone their \\ndevelopment in the liver, persisting as latent forms called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites are not eradicated \\nby standard therapy (e.g., chloroquine) directed against blood stages. Resumption of hypnozoite \\ndevelopment months to years after initial infection can lead to malaria relapse that requires an \\nadditional round of drug therapy to treat recurrent symptoms and eradicate blood-stage parasites. \\nA course of primaquine can prevent relapses of malaria, but this treatment may not always be successful \\nbecause of inadequate patient compliance, interindividual variations of drug metabolism, or variable \\nparasite responses to low or high drug doses.

Either atovaquone-proguanil, \\nmefloquine, or artemether-lumefantrine is an appropriate \\nfirst-line therapy for malaria acquired in areas of chloroquine \\nresistance. Specific treatment should be guided by where the \\npatient acquired the infection and the local resistance patterns. \\nPatients with malaria usually require hospitalization and may \\nrequire intensive care unit admission. Quinidine gluconate is \\nthe only drug available in the United States that is used for \\nparenteral treatment. Artesunate is available from the Centers \\nfor Disease Control and Prevention as an investigational new \\ndrug.\\nComplications and Prognosis\\nCerebral malaria is a complication of P . falciparum infection \\nand a frequent cause of death (10-40% of cases), especially \\namong children and nonimmune adults. Similar to other \\ncomplications, cerebral malaria is more likely to occur among \\npatients with intense parasitemia (>5% of erythrocytes on a \\nblood smear). Other complications include splenic rupture, \\nrenal failure, severe hemolysis (blackwater fever), pulmonary \\nedema, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and algid malaria \\n(sepsis syndrome with vascular collapse).\\nDeath may occur with any of the malarial species but is most \\nfrequent with complicated P . falciparum malaria. The likeli-\\nhood of death is increased in children with pre-existing health \\nproblems, such as measles, intestinal parasites, schistosomiasis, \\nanemia, and malnutrition. Death is much more common in \\ndeveloping countries.\\nPrevention\\nThere are two components of malaria prevention: reduction \\nof exposure to infected mosquitoes and chemoprophylaxis. \\nMosquito protection is necessary because no prophylactic \\nregimen can guarantee protection in every instance due to the \\nwidespread development of resistant organisms.\\nChemoprophylaxis is necessary for all visitors to, and \\nresidents of, the tropics who have not lived there since infancy. \\nChildren of nonimmune women should have chemoprophylaxis \\nfrom birth. Children of women from endemic areas have \\npassive immunity until 3-6 months of age, after which they are \\nincreasingly likely to acquire malaria.

Infection is acquired by infec-\\ntious oocysts, such as those excreted by newly infected cats, \\nwhich play an important role in amplifying the organism in \\nnature, or from ingesting cysts in contaminated, undercooked \\nmeat. Less commonly, transmission occurs transplacentally \\nduring acute infection of pregnant women. In the United States, \\nthe incidence of congenital infection is 1-10 per 10,000 live \\nbirths.\\nAcquired toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic. Symp-\\ntomatic infection is typically a heterophile-negative mono -\\nnucleosis syndrome that includes lymphadenopathy, fever, \\nand hepatosplenomegaly. Disseminated infection, including \\nmyocarditis, pneumonia, and central nervous system (CNS) \\ntoxoplasmosis, is more common among immunocompromised \\npersons, especially persons with acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS). Among women infected during pregnancy, \\n50-60% give birth to an infected infant. The later in pregnancy \\nthat infection occurs, the more likely it is that the fetus will \\nbe infected, but the less severe the illness (see Chapter 66). \\nSerological diagnosis can be established by a fourfold increase \\nin antibody titer or seroconversion, a positive IgM antibody \\ntiter, or positive polymerase chain reaction for T. gondii in \\nperipheral white blood cells, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, or  \\namniotic fluid.\\nTreatment includes pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, which \\nact synergistically against Toxoplasma. Because these compounds \\nare folic acid inhibitors, they are used in conjunction with \\nfolinic acid. Spiramycin, which is not licensed in the United \\nStates but can be obtained from the manufacturer at no cost as \\nan investigational new drug, is also used in therapy of pregnant \\nwomen with toxoplasmosis. Corticosteroids are reserved for \\npatients with acute CNS or ocular infection.\\nIngesting only well-cooked meat and avoiding cats or soil in \\nareas where cats defecate are prudent measures for pregnant or \\nimmunocompromised persons.

Pulmonary ascariasis occurs as the larvae migrate \\nthrough the lung, producing cough, blood-stained sputum, \\neosinophilia, and transient infiltrates on chest x-ray films. \\nAdult larvae in the small intestine may cause abdominal pain \\nand distention. Intestinal obstruction from adult worms can \\noccur, particularly in children due to the small diameter of their \\nintestinal lumens and their propensity to acquire large worm \\nburdens.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) or \\ninterferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is positive, but the chest \\nradiograph is normal or shows healed infection (calcification). \\nTuberculosis disease occurs when there are clinical signs and \\nsymptoms and/or an abnormal chest radiograph or other \\nextrapulmonary manifestation. The interval between latent \\ntuberculosis and the onset of disease may be several weeks in \\nchildren or many decades in adults. In young children, tuber-\\nculosis usually develops as an immediate complication of the \\nprimary infection, and the distinction between infection and \\ndisease may be less obvious.\\nPrimary tuberculosis in children is often an asymptomatic \\ninfection. Often the disease is manifested by a positive TST or \\nIGRA with mild abnormalities on the chest radiograph, such \\nas atelectasis or an infiltrate accompanied by hilar or other \\nadenopathy (Ghon complex). Malaise, low-grade fever, erythema \\nnodosum, or symptoms resulting from lymph node enlargement \\nmay occur after the development of delayed hypersensitivity. \\nProgressive primary disease is characterized by a primary \\npneumonia that develops shortly after initial infection. Progres-\\nsion to disseminated miliary disease or central nervous system \\n(CNS) infection occurs most commonly in the first year of life. \\nCavitation is rare in children but more typical with reactivation \\npulmonary TB in adolescents and adults.\\nTuberculous pleural effusion, which may accompany \\nprimary infection, generally represents the immune response \\nto the organisms and most commonly occurs in older children \\nor adolescents. Pleurocentesis reveals lymphocytes and an \\nincreased protein level, but the pleural fluid usually does not \\ncontain bacilli.\\nReactivation pulmonary tuberculosis, common in adoles-\\ncents and typical in adults, usually is confined to apical segments \\nof upper lobes or superior segments of lower lobes. There is \\nusually little lymphadenopathy and no extrathoracic infection. \\nThis is a manifestation of a secondary expansion of infection at a \\nsite seeded years previously during primary infection. Advanced \\ndisease is associated with cavitation and endobronchial spread \\nof bacilli. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, malaise, and \\nweight loss. A productive cough and hemoptysis often herald \\ncavitation and bronchial erosion.\\nMiliary tuberculosis refers to widespread hematogenous \\ndissemination to multiple organs. The lesions are of roughly \\nthe same size as a millet seed, from which the name miliary is \\nderived. Miliary tuberculosis is characterized by fever, general \\nmalaise, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and \\nhepatosplenomegaly. Diffuse bilateral pneumonitis is common, \\nand meningitis may be present. The chest radiograph reveals \\nbilateral miliary infiltrates, showing overwhelming infection. \\nThe TST may be nonreactive as a result of anergy. Liver or \\nbone marrow biopsy may be useful for diagnosis.\\nTuberculous meningitis most commonly occurs in children \\n<5 years of age or immunocompromised patients and often \\nwithin 6 months of primary infection. Tubercle bacilli that seed \\nthe meninges during the primary infection replicate, triggering \\nan inflammatory response. This condition may have an insidious \\nonset, initially characterized by low-grade fever, headache, and \\nsubtle personality change. Progression of the infection results in \\nbasilar meningitis with impingement of the cranial nerves and \\nis manifested by meningeal irritation and, eventually, increased \\nintracranial pressure, deterioration of mental status, and coma. \\nComputed tomography (CT) scans show hydrocephalus, edema, \\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nIt is estimated that one third of the world’s population is infected \\nwith tuberculosis (TB). Most of these are latent infections. \\nWithout treatment, tuberculosis disease develops in 5-10% of \\nimmunologically normal adults with tuberculosis infection at \\nsome time during their lives; the risk is higher in infants, those \\nwho are immunocompromised, and especially HIV-positive \\nindividuals. An estimated 9 million new cases of tuberculosis \\noccur each year worldwide, including 1 million children. One \\nto 2 million deaths are attributed to the disease annually. Almost \\n10,000 TB cases were reported in the United States in 2014.\\nTransmission of M. tuberculosis is from person to person, \\nusually by respiratory droplets that become airborne when \\na symptomatic individual coughs, sneezes, laughs, or even \\nbreathes. Infected droplets dry and become droplet nuclei, \\nwhich may remain suspended in the air for hours, long after \\nthe infectious person has left the environment.\\nSeveral patient-related factors are associated with an increased \\nchance of transmission. Of these, a positive acid-fast smear of \\nthe sputum most closely correlates with infectivity. Children \\nwith primary pulmonary tuberculosis disease rarely, if ever, \\ninfect others because tubercle bacilli are relatively sparse in \\nthe endobronchial secretions of children with pulmonary \\ntuberculosis. In addition, when young children cough, they \\nrarely produce sputum, lacking the tussive force necessary \\nto project and suspend infectious particles of the requisite \\nsize. Hospitalized patients with suspected pulmonary tuber-\\nculosis should be placed initially in airborne isolation. Most \\ninfectious patients become noninfectious within 2 weeks of \\nstarting effective treatment. Cavitary disease, nonadherence \\nto treatment, and resistant infection increase the risk of  \\ntransmission.\\nIn North America, tuberculosis rates are highest in foreign-\\nborn persons from high-prevalence countries, residents of \\nprisons, residents of nursing homes, homeless persons, users \\nof illegal drugs, persons who are poor and without health care, \\nhealth care workers, and children exposed to adults in high-risk \\ngroups. Most children are infected with M. tuberculosis from \\nhousehold contacts, but outbreaks of childhood tuberculosis \\ncentered in schools, daycares, churches, school buses, and stores \\nstill occur. A high-risk adult working in the area has been \\nthe source of the outbreak in most cases. Immunodeficiency, \\nespecially from HIV infection or from immunosuppressive \\ndrugs, is an important risk factor. Certain biological response \\nmodifiers (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antibodies), often \\nused for inflammatory conditions, can increase risk of develop-\\nment of tuberculosis disease.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nCough\\nHemoptysis\\nBack Pain\\nFever and Rash\\nLymphadenopathy\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

An IGRA is the \\nrecommended diagnostic test for persons older than 5 years \\nof age in the United States. It has similar sensitivity to the \\nTST but improved specificity because it is unaffected by \\nprior BCG vaccination. It is also practically easier to obtain, \\nas it requires only one visit to complete. As with the TST, in \\nimmunocompromised persons and in active tuberculosis, IGRA \\nfindings may be indeterminate.\\nThe ultimate diagnostic confirmation relies on culture of \\nthe organism. Sputum is an excellent source for diagnosis \\nin pulmonary disease in adults but is difficult to obtain in \\nyoung children. Induced sputum or gastric fluid obtained via \\nan indwelling nasogastric tube with samples taken before or \\nimmediately on waking contains swallowed sputum and provides \\nalternate samples in young children. Large volumes of fluid (CSF , \\npericardial fluid) yield a higher rate of recovery of organisms, but \\nslow growth of the mycobacteria makes culture less helpful in \\nacute illness. Even with optimal collection, cultures are positive \\nperiventricular lucencies, and infarctions. Cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF) analysis reveals pleocytosis (50-500 leukocytes/mm3), \\nwhich early in the course of disease may be either lymphocytes \\nor polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Glucose is low, and protein is \\nsignificantly elevated. Acid-fast bacilli are not detected frequently \\nin the CSF by either routine or fluorescent staining procedures. \\nAlthough culture is the standard for diagnosis, PCR for M. \\ntuberculosis may be useful to confirm meningitis, but lacks \\nsensitivity.\\nSkeletal tuberculosis  results from either hematogenous \\nseeding or direct extension from a caseous lymph node. This \\nis usually a chronic disease with an insidious onset that may be \\nmistaken for chronic osteomyelitis. Radiographs reveal cortical \\ndestruction. Biopsy and culture are essential for proper diagnosis. \\nTuberculosis of the spine, Pott disease, is the most common \\nskeletal site.\\nOther forms of tuberculosis include abdominal tuberculosis \\nthat occurs from swallowing infected material. This is a relatively \\nuncommon complication in developed nations where dairy \\nherds are inspected for bovine tuberculosis. Gastrointestinal \\nTB can present with signs and symptoms similar to inflam-\\nmatory bowel disease. Tuberculous peritonitis  is associated \\nwith abdominal tuberculosis and presents as fever, anorexia, \\nascites, and abdominal pain. Urogenital tuberculosis is a late \\nreactivation complication and is rare in children. Symptomatic \\nillness presents as dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, and \\nsterile pyuria. Tuberculosis may also result in extrathoracic \\nlymphadenitis in the cervical, supraclavicular, and subman -\\ndibular areas (scrofula).\\nCongenital tuberculosis can mimic neonatal sepsis or \\npresent at days to weeks of age with hepatosplenomegaly and \\nrespiratory disease.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nTwo types of tests are used to detect the immune response to \\nM. tuberculosis and are used to screen patients for latent \\ntuberculosis and investigation of active tuberculosis. The TST \\nresponse to tuberculin antigen is a manifestation of a T cell–\\nmediated delayed hypersensitivity. The Mantoux test , an \\nintradermal injection of 5 TU (tuberculin units) of purified \\nprotein derivative standard (PPD-S) , usually on the volar \\nsurface of the forearm, is the standard TST. It is usually positive \\n2-6 weeks after onset of infection (up to 3 months) and at the \\ntime of symptomatic illness. This test is preferred in children \\nless than 5 years of age (Table 124.1). False-negative responses \\nmay occur early in the illness, with overwhelming TB infection, \\nwith concomitant viral infection, or as a result of immunosup-\\npression (secondary to underlying illness, HIV , or malnutrition). \\nTests with questionable results should be repeated after several \\nweeks. All internationally adopted children with an initially \\nnegative TST should have a repeat TST after 3 months in the \\nUnited States. The TST is interpreted based on the host status \\nand size of induration (Table 124.2). In general, interpretation \\nof TST in people who have had previous bacille Calmette-\\nGuérin (BCG) vaccine can be difficult, given the cross reaction \\nof TST with antigens present in the vaccine. However, in situ-\\nations when a tuberculosis exposure has occurred, the TST \\nshould be read and interpreted as if no vaccine had been given.\\nAn IGRA is a whole blood test that measures interferon-\\ngamma production by T lymphocytes in response to antigens \\nfrom the M. tuberculosis complex, which includes M. bovis \\nTABLE 124.1 Tuberculin Skin Test Recommendations for \\nInfants, Children, and Adolescents*\\nCHILDREN FOR WHOM IMMEDIATE TST OR IGRA IS \\nINDICATED†:\\n•\\t Contacts\\tof \\tpeople \\twith \\tconfirmed \\tor \\tsuspected \\tcontagious \\t\\ntuberculosis (contact investigation)\\n•\\t Children\\twith \\tradiographic \\tor \\tclinical \\tfindings \\tsuggesting \\t\\ntuberculosis disease\\n•\\t Children\\timmigrating \\tfrom \\tcountries \\twith \\tendemic \\tinfection \\t\\n(e.g., Asia, Middle East, Africa, Latin America, countries of the \\nformer Soviet Union), including international adoptees\\n•\\t Children\\twith \\ttravel \\thistories \\tto \\tcountries \\twith \\tendemic \\t\\ninfection and substantial contact with indigenous people from \\nsuch countries\\nCHILDREN WHO SHOULD HAVE ANNUAL TST OR IGRA ‡:\\n•\\t Children\\tinfected \\twith \\tHIV \\tinfection \\t(TST \\tonly)\\nCHILDREN AT INCREASED RISK OF PROGRESSION OF LTBI \\nTO TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE:\\n•\\t Children\\twith \\tother \\tmedical \\tconditions, \\tincluding \\tdiabetes \\t\\nmellitus, chronic renal failure, malnutrition, and congenital or \\nacquired immunodeficiencies, deserve special consideration. \\nWithout recent exposure, these people are not at increased \\nrisk of acquiring tuberculosis infection.

Spread \\nof infection to regional lymph nodes occurs early. Hilar \\nlymphadenopathy is inevitably present with childhood tuber-\\nculosis. Partial bronchial obstruction caused by external \\ncompression from the enlarging nodes can cause air trapping, \\nhyperinflation, and lobar emphysema. Occasionally children \\nhave a picture of lobar pneumonia without impressive hilar \\nlymphadenopathy. If the infection is progressively destructive, \\nliquefaction of the lung parenchyma leads to formation of a \\nthin-walled primary tuberculous cavity. Adolescents with \\npulmonary tuberculosis may develop segmental lesions with \\nhilar lymphadenopathy or the apical infiltrates, with or without \\ncavitation, that are typical of adult reactivation tuberculosis.\\nRadiographic studies aid greatly in the diagnosis of extrapul-\\nmonary tuberculosis in children. Plain radiographs, CT, and \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tuberculous spine \\nusually show collapse and destruction of the vertebral body with \\nnarrowing of the involved disk spaces. Radiographic findings \\nin bone and joint tuberculosis range from mild joint effusions \\nand small lytic lesions to massive destruction of the bone. CT \\nor MRI of the brains of patients with CNS involvement may be \\nnormal during early stages of the infection. As disease progresses, \\nbasilar enhancement and communicating hydrocephalus with \\nsigns of cerebral edema or early focal ischemia are the most \\ncommon findings.\\nGranulomas on pathology of tissue can also help to establish \\nthe diagnosis of tuberculosis on samples from lymph nodes \\nand other biopsies.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of tuberculosis includes a multitude \\nof diagnoses because tuberculosis may affect any organ, and \\nin early disease the symptoms and signs may be nonspecific. \\nIn pulmonary disease, tuberculosis may appear similar to \\nbacterial or fungal pneumonia, malignancy, and any systemic \\ndisease in which generalized lymphadenopathy occurs. The \\ndiagnosis of tuberculosis should be suspected if the TST or \\nIGRA is positive or if there is history of tuberculosis \\nexposure.\\nThe differential diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenopathy \\nincludes infections caused by atypical mycobacteria, Bartonella, \\nfungi, viruses, and bacteria, as well as toxoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, \\ndrug reactions, and malignancy.\\nTREATMENT\\nCombination therapy is the backbone of therapy for tuberculosis \\ndisease to prevent the emergence of resistance. The treatment \\nof tuberculosis is affected by the presence of naturally occur-\\nring drug-resistant organisms in large bacterial populations, \\neven before therapy is initiated, and the fact that mycobacteria \\nreplicate slowly and can remain dormant in the body for \\nprolonged periods. Patients with latent tuberculosis infection \\nhave small bacterial populations, and a single drug, such as \\nisoniazid (INH), can be given for 9 months. Therapy for \\nlatent infection is aimed at eradicating organisms sequestered \\nwithin macrophages and suppressed by normal T-cell activity. \\nChildren with primary pulmonary tuberculosis and patients with \\nextrapulmonary tuberculosis have medium-sized populations \\nin which significant numbers of drug-resistant organisms may \\nor may not be present. In general these patients are treated \\nin less than half of children with tuberculosis. When the organ-\\nism is grown, drug susceptibilities should be determined because \\nof the increasing incidence of resistant organisms. Utilization \\nof culture and susceptibility results from the source case is \\noften necessary given the difficulty of obtaining timely results.\\nPCR testing for mycobacteria has expedited diagnosis, \\nespecially with CNS disease. However, these assays have limited \\nsensitivity and provide no susceptibility data. Most experts \\nwould recommend that young infants <12 months of age with \\nsuspected tuberculosis undergo lumbar puncture for evaluation \\nof CNS involvement.\\nDiagnostic Imaging\\nBecause many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in children are \\nclinically relatively silent, radiography is a cornerstone for the \\ndiagnosis of disease (Figs. 124.1 and 124.2).

The original vaccine organism was a strain of attenuated \\nMycobacterium bovis. The preferred route of administration is \\nintradermal injection with a syringe and needle because this \\nis the only method that permits accurate measurement of an \\nindividual dose.

In most children with pulmonary tuberculosis, the \\ndisease completely resolves, and ultimately radiographic findings \\nare normal. The prognosis for children with bone and joint \\ntuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis depends directly on \\nthe stage of disease at the time antituberculosis medications \\nare started. Tuberculosis of the spine may result in angulation \\nor gibbus formation that requires surgical correction after the \\ninfection is cured. Most childhood tuberculous meningitis \\noccurs in developing countries, where the prognosis is poor. \\nResistant organisms are more difficult to treat and worsen \\nprognosis.\\nPREVENTION\\nTuberculosis control programs work on case finding and treat-\\nment, which interrupts secondary transmission of infection \\nfrom close contacts. Infected close contacts are identified by \\npositive TST or IGRA testing and can be started on appropriate \\ntreatment to prevent transmission.\\nPrevention of transmission in health care settings involves \\nappropriate physical ventilation of the air around the source \\ncase.

In \\n2012 the estimated number of people over the age of 13 years \\nand living with HIV in the United States was 1.2 million, and \\napproximately 2,000 children have perinatally-acquired infection. \\nVertical transmission is much less common than previously, \\nand approximately 100 infants each year in the United States \\nacquire HIV perinatally. Most pediatric cases in the United \\nStates occur in adolescents who engage in unprotected sexual \\nactivities. Worldwide the number of deaths related to HIV and \\nthe numbers of children infected with HIV have steadily \\ndecreased in large part due to treatment with antiretroviral \\ntherapy.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nRNA virus of the retrovirus family that produces a reverse \\ntranscriptase enabling the viral RNA to act as a template for \\nDNA transcription and integration into the host genome. HIV-1 \\ncauses 99% of all human cases. HIV-2, which is less virulent, \\ncauses 1-9% of cases in parts of Africa and is very rare in the \\nUnited States.\\nHIV infects helper T cells (CD4 cells) and cells of monocyte-\\nmacrophage lineage via interaction of viral protein gp120 with \\nthe CD4 molecule and chemokines (CXCR4 and CCR5) that \\nserve as coreceptors. Interaction with these molecules facilitates \\nmembrane fusion and cell entry by the virus. HIV infection \\ndirectly and indirectly depletes CD4 T cells. Because helper T \\ncells are important for delayed hypersensitivity, T cell–dependent \\nB-cell antibody production, and T cell–mediated lymphokine \\nactivation of macrophages, their destruction produces a pro-\\nfound combined (B and T cell) immunodeficiency. A lack of \\nT-cell regulation and unrestrained antigenic stimulation result \\nin polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia with nonspecific and \\nineffective globulins. Other cells bearing CD4, such as microglia, \\nastrocytes, oligodendroglia, and placental tissues, also may be \\ninfected with HIV .\\nHIV infection is a continuously progressive process with \\na variable period of clinical latency before development of \\nAIDS-defining conditions. All untreated patients have evidence \\nof ongoing viral replication and progressive CD4 lymphocyte \\ndepletion. There are no overt manifestations of immunode-\\nficiency until CD4 cell numbers decline to critical threshold \\nlevels. Quantitation of the viral load (HIV-1 RNA level) has \\nbecome an important parameter in management.\\nHorizontal transmission of HIV is by sexual contact \\n(vaginal, anal, or orogenital), percutaneous contact (from \\ncontaminated needles or other sharp objects), or mucous \\nmembrane exposure to contaminated blood or body fluid. \\nTransmission by contaminated blood and blood products has \\nbeen eliminated in developed countries by screening donated \\nblood products, but still occurs in developing countries. Verti-\\ncal transmission of HIV from mother to infant may occur \\ntransplacentally in utero, during birth, or via breast feeding. Risk \\nfactors for perinatal transmission include prematurity, prolonged \\nrupture of membranes, and high maternal HIV viral load at \\ndelivery. In non–breast feeding infants, perinatal transmission \\ncan be decreased from approximately 25% to less than 8% with \\nadministration of intravenous (IV) zidovudine during labor and \\npostnatal treatment of the infant with oral zidovudine. Maternal \\ntreatment during pregnancy with combination antiretroviral \\ntherapy (cART) can reduce the risk of transmission to <1%. \\nBreast feeding by HIV-infected mothers increases the risk of \\nvertical transmission. In developing countries where breast \\nfeeding is associated with increased survival and decreased \\nmorbidity from malnutrition, diarrheal diseases, and other \\ninfections, continued administration of either cART for the \\nmother or postnatal prophylactic ART for the infant can reduce \\ntransmission risk from breast feeding. In untreated infants, the \\nmean incubation interval for development of an AIDS-defining \\ncondition after vertical transmission is 5 months (range, 1-24 \\nmonths) compared with a longer incubation period after \\nhorizontal transmission of 7-10 years.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nWorldwide, as of 2015, approximately 36.7 million persons are \\nliving with HIV , and 3.4 million of them are children. There \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nNeck Masses\\nHoarseness\\nDiarrhea\\nArthritis\\nFever and Rash\\nLymphadenopathy\\nAnemia\\nPetechiae/Purpura\\nFailure to Thrive\\nIn adolescents and adults, primary infection results in the acute \\nretroviral syndrome (resembling mononucleosis) that develops \\nafter an incubation period of 2-6 weeks and consists of fever, \\nmalaise, weight loss, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and often \\na maculopapular rash. The risk of opportunistic infections and \\nother AIDS-defining conditions is related to the depletion of \\nCD4 T cells. A combination of CD4 cell count and percentage \\nand clinical manifestations is used to classify HIV infection in \\nchildren (Tables 125.1 and 125.2).\\nInitial symptoms with vertical transmission vary and may \\ninclude failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental delay, lymphade-\\nnopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, \\ninterstitial pneumonitis, or oral thrush. These findings may \\nbe subtle and remarkable only by their persistence. Manifes-\\ntations that are more common in children than adults with \\nHIV infection include recurrent bacterial infections, lymphoid \\nhyperplasia, chronic parotid swelling, lymphocytic interstitial \\npneumonitis, and earlier onset of progressive neurological \\ndeterioration. Pulmonary manifestations of HIV infection \\nare common and include Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, \\nwhich can present early in infancy as a primary pneumonia \\ncharacterized by hypoxia, tachypnea, retractions, elevated serum \\nlactate dehydrogenase, and fever.\\nIn the United States, most pregnant women are screened \\nand, if indicated, treated for HIV infection. Women with high \\nHIV viral loads at delivery will be offered a cesarean section. \\nAll infants born to HIV-infected mothers are bathed prior to \\nreceiving their newborn hepatitis B vaccine and vitamin K injec-\\ntion, receive antiretroviral prophylaxis, are exclusively formula \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Combination therapy that includes either a \\nnon-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a \\nprotease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor depending \\non the child’s age plus a dual–nucleoside/nucleotide reverse \\ntranscriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone is recommended for \\ninitial treatment of all HIV infected children.

The diagnosis \\nof HIV infection in most infants born in the United States is \\nconfirmed before development of clinical signs of infection.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nHIV infection can be diagnosed definitively in non–breast fed \\ninfants by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants \\nby 6 months of age using viral diagnostic assays (RNA poly-\\nmerase chain reaction [PCR] or DNA PCR). Maternal antibodies \\nmay be detectable until 12-15 months of age, and a positive \\nserological test in the infant is not considered diagnostic until \\n18 months of age. HIV PCR (RNA or DNA) is the preferred \\nmethod for diagnosing HIV infection during infancy and \\nidentifies ~50% of infected newborns at 48 hours and ~90% \\nat 28 days. Timing of diagnostic viral testing varies depending \\non specific risk factors but typically involves testing at 1-2 weeks \\nof age, at 1-2 months of age, and at 4-6 months of age. Testing \\nat birth should be considered for infants at high risk for in \\nutero infection (high maternal HIV viral load at delivery). HIV \\nRNA PCR has 25-60% sensitivity during the first weeks of life, \\nincreasing to 90-100% by 2-3 months of age.\\nHIV infection of an exposed infant is confirmed if virological \\ntests are positive on two separate occasions. HIV infection can \\nbe reasonably excluded in non–breast fed infants with at least \\ntwo virological tests performed at older than 1 month of age, \\nwith one test being performed after 4 months of age. Loss of \\nHIV antibody combined with negative HIV DNA PCR confirms \\nabsence of HIV infection. Persistence of a positive HIV antibody \\ntest after 18 months of age indicates HIV infection.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of AIDS in infants includes primary \\nimmunodeficiency syndromes and intrauterine infections such \\nas cytomegalovirus (CMV) and syphilis. Prominence of indi-\\nvidual symptoms, such as diarrhea, may suggest other \\netiologies.\\nTREATMENT\\nManagement of HIV infection in children and adolescents is \\nevolving and complex. It should be directed by a specialist in \\nthe treatment of HIV infection. cART is recommended for all \\nHIV-infected children; however, urgency of cART initiation is \\nbased on age, the severity of HIV disease as indicated by AIDS-\\ndefining conditions, and the risk of disease progression as \\nindicated by CD4 cell count (Table 125.3). Initiation of anti -\\nretroviral therapy while the patient is still asymptomatic may \\npreserve immune function and prevent clinical progression \\nbut incurs the adverse effects of therapy and may facilitate \\nemergence of drug-resistant virus if medication adherence is \\npoor.\\nUrgent initiation of therapy (see Table 125.3) is recommended \\nfor infants less than 12 months of age regardless of symptoms \\nof HIV disease or HIV RNA level. Urgent initiation of therapy \\nis recommended for all children >1 year of age with AIDS or \\nsignificant HIV-related symptoms or severe immunosuppression \\n(CD4 below 500 cells/mm3 for children ages 1 to ≤6 years and \\nbelow 200 cells/mm3 for children >6 years of age), regardless of \\nsymptoms or HIV RNA level.

Administration of maternal cART \\nthroughout pregnancy to achieve viral suppression (viral load \\n<1,000 copies/mL) with postnatal antiretroviral prophylaxis to \\nthe infant reduces the risk of transmission even further to <1% in \\nnon–breast feeding infants. The current recommendations for the \\nUnited States include a 4- to -6-week prophylactic regimen with \\nzidovudine for the infant in combination with maternal intra-\\npartum therapy. The maternal regimen includes continuation or \\ninitiation of antiretroviral therapy. In high-risk situations (e.g., \\nmother’s viral load is >1,000 copies/mL or is unknown, mother \\ndid not receive cART during pregnancy), intravenous zidovudine \\nduring delivery is administered and additional antiretrovirals \\nmay be given to the infant postnatally (http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/\\ncontentfiles/lvguidelines/peri_recommendations.pdf). Scheduled \\ncesarean section at 38 weeks to prevent vertical transmission is \\nrecommended for women with HIV RNA levels greater than \\n1,000 copies/mL, but it is unclear whether cesarean section is \\nbeneficial when viral load is less than 1,000 copies/mL or when \\nmembranes have already ruptured.\\nPreventing HIV infection in adults decreases the incidence \\nof infection in children. Adult prevention results from behavior \\nchanges such as safe-sex practices, decrease in intravenous drug \\nuse, and needle exchange programs. Screening of blood donors \\nhas almost eliminated the risk of HIV transmission from blood \\nproducts. HIV infection almost never is transmitted in a casual \\nor nonsexual household setting.\\nSuggested Readings\\nBennett JE, Dolin R, Blaser MJ.

In addition to 13-valent \\npneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 23-valent pneumococcal \\npolysaccharide vaccine is recommended for HIV-infected \\nchildren at 2 years of age and adolescents and adults with CD4 \\ncounts at or above 200/mm3. Because of the risk of fatal measles \\nin children with AIDS, children without severe immunosup -\\npression should receive their first dose of MMR at 12 months \\nof age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age. Varicella-zoster \\nvirus (VZV) vaccine should be given only to asymptomatic, \\nnonimmunosuppressed children beginning at 12 months of age \\nas two doses of vaccine at least 3 months apart. Inactivated split \\ninfluenza virus vaccine should be administered annually to all \\nHIV-infected children at or after 6 months of age.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nThe approach to the numerous opportunistic infections in \\nHIV-infected patients involves treatment and prophylaxis for \\ninfections likely to occur as CD4 cells are depleted. With potent \\nantiretroviral therapy and immune reconstitution, routine \\nprophylaxis for common opportunistic infections depends on \\nthe child’s age and CD4 count. Infants born to HIV-infected \\nmothers receive prophylaxis for P . jiroveci pneumonia with \\ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) beginning at 4-6 \\nweeks of age and continued for the first year of life or until \\nHIV infection has been excluded. TMP-SMX prophylaxis for \\nP . jiroveci pneumonia for older children and adolescents is \\nprovided if CD4 cell counts are less than 500 cells/mm3 or CD4 \\npercentage <15% for children 1 to <6 years of age, or less than \\n200 cells/mm3 or CD4 percentage <15% for children <6 years \\nof age. Clarithromycin prophylaxis for Mycobacterium avium \\ncomplex infection is provided if CD4 cell counts are below 750 \\ncells/mm3 for children <1 year of age, below 500 cells/mm3 for \\nchildren 1 to <2 years of age, below 75 cells/mm 3 for children \\n2 to <6 years of age, and below 50 cells/mm 3 for children ≥6 \\nyears of age.\\nP . jiroveci pneumonia is treated with high-dose TMP-SMX \\nand corticosteroids. Oral and gastrointestinal candidiasis is \\ncommon in children and usually responds to fluconazole \\ntherapy. VZV infection may be severe and should be treated \\nwith acyclovir or other antivirals. Recurrent herpes simplex \\nvirus (HSV) infections also may require long-term antiviral \\nprophylaxis. Other common infections in HIV-infected patients \\ninclude toxoplasmosis, CMV , Epstein-Barr virus infection, \\nsalmonellosis, and tuberculosis.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe availability of cART has improved the prognosis for HIV \\nand AIDS dramatically. Risk of death is directly related to the \\ndegree of immunosuppression, viral load, and young age. \\nChildren less than 1 year of age with very low CD4 percentiles \\nand high viral loads have the poorest prognosis.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Bishop |  D awn R. Ebach\\nCHAPTER 126 \\nDigestive System Assessment\\nHISTORY\\nAfter identifying the major gastrointestinal (GI) symptom, the \\nonset and progression should be determined (improved, \\nunchanged, worsening). Characterization of signs and symptoms \\nshould identify factors that trigger or alleviate the symptom; \\nthe timing, frequency, and duration of symptoms; relationship \\nto meals and defecation; and associated symptoms (e.g., fever \\nor weight loss). Other key history includes exposures to others \\n(family, school contacts, pets), travel, environmental exposure, \\nand impact of illness on the child (school absences, weight \\nloss).\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nThe history may suggest a diagnosis and direct the evaluation, \\nwhich should include a full examination as well as a thorough \\nabdominal examination. Extraintestinal disorders may produce \\nGI manifestations (e.g., emesis with group A streptococcal \\npharyngitis, abdominal pain with lower lobe pneumonia). The \\nexamination should begin with a careful external inspection \\nfor abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal \\nabdominal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. \\nAbnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur \\nwith bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the \\nexaminer should note location, facial expression, guarding, and \\nrebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of \\nthe liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, \\norganomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting \\nabnormal firmness or contour. A rectal examination, including \\ninspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous open-\\nings, should be performed for children with history suggesting \\nconstipation, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, \\nand suspicion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Digital \\nrectal examination should include assessment of anal sphincter \\ntone, anal canal size and elasticity, tenderness, extrinsic masses, \\npresence of fecal impaction, and caliber of the rectum. Stool \\nshould be tested for occult blood.\\nSCREENING TESTS\\nA complete blood count may provide evidence for inflammation \\n(white blood cell [WBC] and platelet count), poor nutrition \\nor bleeding (hemoglobin, red blood cell volume, reticulocyte \\ncount), and infection (WBC number and differential, presence \\nof toxic granulation). Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen \\n(BUN), and creatinine help define hydration status. Tests of \\nliver dysfunction include total and direct bilirubin, alanine \\naminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase for evidence of \\nhepatocellular injury, and γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline \\nphosphatase for evidence of bile duct injury. Hepatic synthetic \\nfunction can be assessed by coagulation factor levels, prothrom-\\nbin time, and albumin level. Pancreatic enzyme tests (amylase, \\nlipase) provide evidence of pancreatic injury or inflammation. \\nUrinalysis can gauge dehydration and identify a possible source \\nof protein loss.\\nDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING\\nRadiology\\nA plain abdominal x-ray to document excessive retained stool \\nwhen history is consistent with constipation and encopresis is \\nnot necessary, as physical examination alone can confirm the \\ndiagnosis.\\nEndoscopy\\nEndoscopy permits the direct visualization of the interior of \\nthe gut. Video endoscopes may be used even in very small \\ninfants by pediatric gastroenterologists. Wireless capsule \\nendoscopy (Fig. 126.1) enables visualization of lesions beyond \\nthe reach of conventional endoscopes.\\nConsultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist for endoscopy \\nis recommended for further evaluation of suspected esophageal \\nor gastric inflammation unresponsive to medications, to confirm \\nthe diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis or celiac disease, \\nto evaluate GI bleeding, to investigate suspected IBD, or to \\nscreen for polyp disorders. In addition, a trained endoscopist \\ncan remove esophageal and gastric foreign bodies and place \\nfeeding tubes.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS OF \\nGASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS\\nAbdominal Pain\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Somatic pathways stimulated by small bowel visceral \\nafferents affect the periumbilical area, and colonic injury results \\nin infraumbilical referred pain.\\nAcute Abdominal Pain\\nDistinguishing Features\\nAcute abdominal pain can signal the presence of a dangerous \\nintraabdominal process (e.g., appendicitis or bowel obstruction) \\nor may originate from extraintestinal sources (e.g., lower lobe \\npneumonia or urinary tract stone). Not all episodes of acute \\nabdominal pain require emergency intervention. Appendicitis \\nand volvulus, for example, must be ruled out as quickly as \\npossible. Few patients presenting with acute abdominal pain \\nactually have a surgical emergency, but they must be separated \\nfrom cases that can be managed conservatively.\\nInitial Diagnostic Evaluation\\nTable 126.1 lists a diagnostic approach to acute abdominal pain \\nin children. Events that occur with a discrete, abrupt onset, \\nsuch as passage of a stone, perforation of a viscus, or infarction, \\nresult in a sudden onset of pain. Gradual onset of pain is \\ncommon with infectious or inflammatory causes, such as \\nappendicitis and IBD.\\nA standard group of laboratory tests usually is performed for \\nacute abdominal pain (see Table 126.1). An abdominal x-ray \\nseries evaluates for bowel obstruction, fecalith, or nephrolithiasis. \\nUltrasound or computed tomography (CT) can visualize the \\nappendix if appendicitis is suspected but the diagnosis remains \\nin doubt. If the initial evaluation suggests intussusception, a \\nbarium or pneumatic (air) enema may be used to diagnose \\nand treat this condition (see Chapter 129).\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nTable 126.2 lists the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal \\npain in children. The urgent task of the clinician is to rule \\nout surgical emergencies. In young children, malrotation \\nwith volvulus, incarcerated hernia, congenital anomalies, \\nand intussusception are common concerns. In older children \\nand teenagers, appendicitis is more common. An acute \\nsurgical abdomen is characterized by signs of peritonitis, \\nincluding tenderness, abdominal wall rigidity, guarding, and \\nabsent or diminished bowel sounds. Helpful characteristics \\nof onset, location, referral, and quality of pain are noted in  \\nTable 126.3.\\nFunctional Abdominal Pain and Irritable  \\nBowel Syndrome\\nGeneral Considerations\\nAbdominal pain can result from injury to the intraabdominal \\norgans or overlying somatic structures in the abdominal wall, \\nor from extraabdominal diseases. Visceral pain results when \\nautonomic nerves within the gut detect injury, transmitting \\nsensation by nonmyelinated fibers. The pain is vague, dull, \\nslow in onset, and poorly localized. A variety of stimuli, \\nincluding normal peristalsis and various intraluminal chemi-\\ncal and osmotic states, activate these fibers to some degree. \\nRegardless of the stimulus, visceral pain is perceived when a \\nthreshold of intensity or duration is crossed. Lower degrees \\nof activation may result in perception of nonpainful or \\nperhaps vaguely uncomfortable sensations, whereas more \\nintensive stimulation of these fibers results in pain. Overac-\\ntive sensation may be the basis of some kinds of abdominal \\npain, such as functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel  \\nsyndrome (IBS).\\nIn contrast to visceral pain, somatic pain results when \\noverlying body structures are injured. Somatic structures \\ninclude the parietal peritoneum, fascia, muscles, and skin of \\nthe abdominal wall. In contrast to pain emanating from visceral \\ninjury, somatic nociceptive fibers are myelinated and are capable \\nof rapid transmission of well-localized painful stimuli. When \\nintraabdominal processes cause inflammation or injury to \\nthe parietal peritoneum or abdominal wall structures, poorly \\nlocalized visceral pain becomes well-localized somatic pain. \\nFor example, in acute appendicitis, the initial activation of \\nvisceral nociceptive fibers yields poorly localized discomfort \\nin the midabdomen. When the inflammatory process extends \\nto the overlying parietal peritoneum, the pain becomes severe \\nand localizes to the right lower quadrant. This is called somato-\\nparietal pain.\\nReferred pain is a painful sensation in a body region distant \\nfrom the true source of pain. The location of referred pain \\nis predictable based on the locus of visceral injury. Stomach \\npain is referred to the epigastric and retrosternal regions, and \\nFIGURE 126.1 Wireless capsule endoscopy: Aphthous ulcers (arrows) \\nin jejunum diagnostic of Crohn disease in patient with negative findings \\non upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nVomiting\\nRecurrent abdominal pain is a common problem, affecting \\nmore than 10% of all children. The peak incidence occurs \\nbetween ages 7 and 12 years. Although the differential diagnosis \\nof recurrent abdominal pain is fairly extensive (Table 126.4), \\nmost children do not have a serious (or even identifiable) \\nunderlying illness causing the pain.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

IBS is a subset of functional abdominal \\npain, characterized by onset of pain at the time of a change in \\nstool frequency or consistency, a stool pattern fluctuating \\nbetween diarrhea and constipation, and relief of pain with \\ndefecation. Symptoms in IBS are linked to gut motility. Pain \\nis commonly accompanied in both groups of children by school \\navoidance, secondary gains, anxiety about imagined causes, \\nlack of coping skills, and disordered peer relationships (Table \\n126.5).\\nDistinguishing Features\\nOne needs to distinguish between functional pain/IBS and more \\nserious underlying disorders.

The initial evaluation recom -\\nmended in Table 126.7 is a sensible approach, avoiding unneces-\\nsary testing and providing ample sensitivity for most serious \\nunderlying disorders. While waiting for laboratory and \\nultrasound results, a 3-day trial of a lactose-free diet can evaluate \\nfor lactose intolerance. If tests are normal and no warning signs \\nare present, testing should be stopped. If there are warning \\nsigns, progression of symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities \\nthat suggest a specific diagnosis, additional investigation may \\nbe warranted.\\nTreatment of Recurrent Abdominal Pain\\nA child who is repeatedly kept home from school because of \\npain receives reinforcement in the form of being excused from \\nresponsibilities and withdraws from full social functioning. \\nThis tends to both increase anxiety and prolong the course. To \\nbreak the cycle of pain and disability, the child with functional \\npain must be assisted in returning to normal activities \\nimmediately. Instead of being sent home from school with \\nstomachaches, a child may be allowed to take a short break \\nfrom class until symptoms abate. The child and parents should \\nbe informed that pain is likely to be worse on the day the child \\nreturns to school as anxiety worsens dysmotility and enhances \\npain perception.

Vomiting should \\nbe distinguished from regurgitation of stomach contents, also \\nknown as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), chalasia, or “spitting \\nup. ” Although the end result of vomiting and regurgitation is \\nsimilar, they have completely different characteristics. Vomiting \\nis usually preceded by nausea and is accompanied by forceful \\ngagging and retching. Regurgitation, on the other hand, is \\neffortless and not preceded by nausea.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nIn neonates with true vomiting, congenital obstructive lesions \\nshould be considered. Allergic reactions to formula in the first \\n2 months of life may present with vomiting. Infantile GER \\n(“spitting up”) occurs in most infants and can be large in volume, \\nbut is effortless, and these infants do not appear ill. Pyloric \\nstenosis occurs in the first months of life and is characterized \\nby steadily worsening, forceful vomiting that occurs immediately \\nafter feedings. A visibly distended stomach, often with visible \\nperistaltic waves, is often seen before vomiting. Pyloric stenosis \\nis more common in male infants; the family history may be \\npositive. Other obstructive lesions, such as intestinal duplication \\ncysts, atresias, webs, and midgut malrotation, should be con-\\nsidered. Metabolic disorders (e.g., organic acidemias, galacto-\\nsemia, urea cycle defects, adrenogenital syndromes) may present \\nwith vomiting in infants. In older children with acute vomiting, \\nviruses and food poisoning are common. Other infections, \\nespecially streptococcal pharyngitis, urinary tract infections, \\nand otitis media, commonly result in vomiting. When vomiting \\nis chronic, central nervous system (CNS) causes (increased \\nintracranial pressure, migraine) must be considered. Cyclic \\nvomiting syndrome or migraine may be the etiology of recurrent \\nvomiting. When abdominal pain or bilious emesis accompanies \\nvomiting, evaluation for bowel obstruction, peptic disorders, \\nand appendicitis must be immediately initiated.\\nDistinguishing Features\\nTable 126.8 lists common diagnoses that must be considered \\nand their important historical features. Given the frequency \\nof viral gastroenteritis as the etiology, it is important to be alert \\nfor unusual features that suggest another diagnosis. Viral \\ngastroenteritis usually is not associated with severe abdominal \\npain or headache and does not recur at frequent intervals.\\nPhysical examination should include assessment of the \\nchild’s hydration status, including examination of capillary \\nrefill, moistness of mucous membranes, and skin turgor (see \\nChapter 38). The chest should be auscultated for evidence of \\nrales or other signs of pulmonary involvement. The abdomen \\nmust be examined carefully for distention, organomegaly, bowel \\nsounds, tenderness, and guarding. A rectal examination and \\ntesting stool for occult blood should be considered.\\nLaboratory evaluation of vomiting should include serum \\nelectrolytes, tests of renal function, complete blood count, \\namylase, lipase, and liver function tests. Additional testing \\nmay be required immediately when history and examination \\nsuggest a specific etiology. Ultrasound is useful to look for \\npyloric stenosis, gallstones, renal stones, hydronephrosis, biliary \\nobstruction, pancreatitis, malrotation, intussusception, and other \\nanatomical abnormalities. CT may be indicated to rule out \\nappendicitis or to observe structures that cannot be visualized \\nwell by ultrasound.

Deaths from diarrhea are rare in industrialized \\ncountries but are common elsewhere. Acute diarrhea is a major \\nproblem when it occurs with malnutrition or in the absence \\nof basic medical care (see Chapter 30). In North America, most \\nacute diarrhea is viral and is self-limited, requiring no diagnostic \\ntesting or specific intervention. Bacterial agents tend to cause \\nmuch more severe illness and typically are seen in food-\\nassociated outbreaks or in regions with poor public sanitation. \\nBacterial enteritis should be suspected when there is dysentery \\n(bloody diarrhea with fever) and whenever severe symptoms \\nare present. These infections can be diagnosed by stool culture \\nor other assays for specific pathogens. Chronic diarrhea lasts \\nmore than 2 weeks and has a wide range of possible causes, \\nincluding serious and benign conditions that are more difficult \\nto diagnose.\\nParents use the word diarrhea to describe loose or watery \\nstools, excessively frequent stools, or stools that are large in \\nvolume. Constipation with overflow incontinence can be \\nmislabeled as diarrhea. A more exact definition of diarrhea \\nis excessive daily stool liquid volume (>10 mL stool/kg body \\nweight/day). Stool texture, volume, and frequency help to \\ncharacterize the episode of diarrhea.\\nTABLE 126.9 Differential Diagnosis of Diarrhea\\nINFANT CHILD ADOLESCENT\\nACUTE\\nCommon Gastroenteritis* Gastroenteritis* Gastroenteritis*\\nSystemic infection Food poisoning Food poisoning\\nAntibiotic associated (?)

Etiological agents include \\nviruses, bacteria or their toxins, chemicals, parasites, malab-\\nsorbed substances, and inflammation. Table 126.9 lists common \\ncauses of diarrhea in childhood. Secretory diarrhea occurs \\nwhen the intestinal mucosa directly secretes fluid and electrolytes \\ninto the stool and is the result of inflammation (e.g., IBD, \\nchemical stimulus). Secretion also is stimulated by mediators \\nof inflammation and by various hormones, such as vasoactive \\nintestinal peptide secreted by a neuroendocrine tumor. Cholera \\nis a secretory diarrhea stimulated by the enterotoxin of Vibrio \\ncholerae, which causes increased levels of cyclic adenosine \\nmonophosphate (cAMP) within enterocytes and leads to secre-\\ntion into the small-bowel lumen.\\nOsmotic diarrhea occurs after malabsorption of an ingested \\nsubstance, which “pulls” water into the bowel lumen. A classic \\nexample is the diarrhea of lactose intolerance. Osmotic diarrhea \\nalso can result from generalized maldigestion, such as that seen \\nwith pancreatic insufficiency or with intestinal injury. Certain \\nnonabsorbable laxatives, such as polyethylene glycol and milk \\nof magnesia, also cause osmotic diarrhea. Fermentation of \\nmalabsorbed substances (e.g., lactose) often occurs, resulting \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A trial of lactose \\nrestriction for several days or lactose breath hydrogen testing \\nis helpful in the evaluation of lactose intolerance.\\nConstipation and Encopresis\\nin gas, cramps, and acidic stools. A common cause of chronic \\nloose stools in early childhood is functional diarrhea, com-\\nmonly known as toddler’s diarrhea. This condition is defined \\nby frequent watery stools in the setting of normal growth and \\nweight gain and is caused by excessive intake of sweetened \\nliquids overwhelming the disaccharide absorptive capacity of \\nthe intestine. Diarrhea typically improves tremendously when \\nthe child’s beverage intake is reduced or changed.\\nDistinguishing Features\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nDiarrhea\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nConstipation\\nStools are isosmotic, even in osmotic diarrhea, because of the \\nrelatively free exchange of water across the intestinal mucosa. \\nOsmoles present in the stool are a mixture of electrolytes and \\nother osmotically active solutes. To determine whether the \\ndiarrhea is osmotic or secretory, the osmotic gap is \\ncalculated:\\nOsmotic gapN aK=− +++290 2([] [] )\\nAssuming the stool is isosmotic (an osmolarity of \\n290 mO sm/L), the measured stool sodium and potassium \\n(and their associated anions, accounting for an equal amount) \\naccounts for much of the osmolality. Secretory diarrhea is \\ncharacterized by an osmotic gap of less than 50. A number \\nsignificantly higher than 50 defines osmotic diarrhea and \\nindicates that malabsorbed substances other than electrolytes \\naccount for fecal osmolarity.\\nAnother way to differentiate between osmotic and secretory \\ndiarrhea is to stop all feedings (in hospitalized patients receiving \\nIV fluids). If the diarrhea stops completely while the child is \\nNPO (nothing by mouth), the patient has osmotic diarrhea. \\nA child with a pure secretory diarrhea would continue to have \\nmassive stool output. Neither method for classifying diarrhea \\nworks perfectly, because most diarrheal illnesses are a mixture of \\nsecretory and osmotic components. Viral enteritis damages the \\nintestinal lining, causing malabsorption and osmotic diarrhea. \\nThe associated inflammation results in release of mediators that \\ncause excessive secretion. A child with viral enteritis may have \\ndecreased stool volume while NPO, but the secretory component \\nof the diarrhea persists until the inflammation resolves.\\nThe history should include the onset of diarrhea, number \\nand character of stools, estimates of stool volume, and presence \\nof other symptoms, such as blood in the stool, fever, and weight \\nloss. Recent travel and exposures should be documented, dietary \\nfactors should be investigated, and a list of medications recently \\nused should be obtained. Factors that seem to worsen or improve \\nthe diarrhea should be determined. Physical examination should \\nbe thorough, evaluating for abdominal distention, tenderness, \\nquality of bowel sounds, presence of blood in the stool or a \\nlarge fecal mass on rectal examination, and anal sphincter tone.\\nLaboratory testing should include stool culture and complete \\nblood count if bacterial enteritis is suspected. If diarrhea occurs \\nafter a course of antibiotics, a Clostridium difficile toxin assay \\nshould be ordered; if stools are reported to be oily or fatty, fecal \\nfat content or fecal elastase to test for pancreatic insufficiency \\nshould be measured. Tests for specific diagnoses should be sent \\nConstipation is a common problem in childhood. When a child \\nis thought to be constipated, his parents may be concerned \\nabout straining with defecation, hard stool consistency, large \\nstool size, decreased stool frequency, fear of passing stools, or \\nany combination of these. Physicians define constipation as \\ntwo or fewer stools per week or passage of hard, pellet-like stools \\nfor at least 2 weeks. A common pattern of constipation is \\nfunctional constipation, which is characterized by two or fewer \\nstools per week, voluntary withholding of stool, and infrequent \\npassage of large-diameter, often painful stools. Children with \\nfunctional fecal retention often exhibit “retentive posturing” \\n(standing or sitting with legs extended and stiff or crossed legs) \\nand have associated fecal incontinence caused by leakage of \\nretained stool (encopresis).\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis is listed in Table 126.10. Functional \\nconstipation commonly occurs during toilet training, when \\nthe child is unwilling to defecate on the toilet. Retained stool \\nbecomes harder and larger over time, leading to painful defeca-\\ntion. This aggravates voluntary withholding of stool, with \\nperpetuation of the constipation.\\nHirschsprung disease is characterized by delayed meconium \\npassage in newborns, abdominal distention, vomiting, occasional \\nfever, and foul-smelling stools. This condition is caused by failure \\nof ganglion cells to migrate into the distal bowel, resulting in \\nspasm and functional obstruction of the aganglionic segment. \\nOnly about 6% of infants with Hirschsprung disease pass meco-\\nnium in the first 24 hours of life, compared with 95% of normal \\ninfants. Most affected babies rapidly become ill with symptoms \\nof enterocolitis or obstruction. Affected older children do not \\npass large-caliber stools because of rectal spasm, and they do \\nnot have encopresis. Other causes of constipation include spinal \\ncord abnormalities, hypothyroidism, drugs, cystic fibrosis, and \\nanorectal malformations (see Table 126.10). A variety of systemic \\ndisorders affecting metabolism or muscle function can result in \\nconstipation. Children with developmental disabilities have a \\ngreat propensity for constipation because of diminished capacity \\nto cooperate with toileting, reduced effort or control of pelvic \\nfloor muscles during defecation, and diminished perception \\nof the need to pass stool.\\nDistinguishing Features\\nTable 126.10 includes typical characteristics of the common \\ncauses of constipation. Congenital malformations usually cause \\nsymptoms from birth. Functional constipation is overwhelmingly \\nthe most common diagnosis in older patients. Constipation in \\nolder children often begins after starting school, when free and \\nprivate access to toilets may be restricted. Use of some drugs, \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Y oung children with painful defecation \\nmust have a prolonged course of stool softener therapy to \\nalleviate fear of defecation. The child should be asked to sit on \\nthe toilet for a few minutes on awakening in the morning and \\nimmediately after meals, when the colon is most active and it \\nis easiest to pass a stool. Use of a positive reinforcement system \\nfor taking medication and sitting on the toilet is helpful for \\nyounger children. The stool softener chosen should be non–habit \\nforming, safe, and palatable. Polyethylene glycol and milk of \\nmagnesia are the most commonly used agents.\\nGastrointestinal Bleeding\\nespecially opiates and some psychotropic medications, also is \\nassociated with constipation.\\nFor a few specific causes of constipation, directed diagnostic \\ntesting can make the diagnosis. A narrowed, aganglionic distal \\nbowel and dilated proximal bowel on barium enema suggests \\nHirschsprung disease. Rectal suction biopsy confirms the \\nabsence of ganglion cells in the rectal submucosal plexus, with \\nhypertrophy of nerve fibers. Lack of internal anal sphincter relax-\\nation can be shown by anorectal manometry in Hirschsprung \\ndisease. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed by examination and by \\nthyroid function testing. Anorectal malformations are easily \\ndetected by rectal examination. Cystic fibrosis (meconium \\nileus) is diagnosed by sweat chloride determination or CFTR \\ngene mutation analysis (see Chapter 137). Most children with \\nconstipation have functional constipation and do not have any \\nlaboratory abnormality. Examination reveals normal or reduced \\nanal sphincter tone (owing to stretching by passage of large \\nstools). Fecal impaction is usually present, but a large-caliber, \\nempty rectum may be found if a stool has just been passed.\\nEvaluation and Treatment  \\nof Functional Constipation\\nIn most cases of constipation, the history is consistent with \\nfunctional constipation—absence of neonatal constipation, \\nactive fecal retention, and infrequent, large stools with soiling. \\nIn these patients, no testing other than a good physical \\nTABLE 126.10 Common Causes of Constipation and Characteristic Features\\nCAUSES OF CONSTIPATION CLINICAL FEATURES\\nHirschsprung disease History: Failure to pass stool in first 24  hr, abdominal distention, vomiting, symptoms of enterocolitis \\n(fever, foul-smelling diarrhea, megacolon).

When dark clots or melena are seen mixed \\nwith stool, a higher location is suspected, whereas bright red \\nblood on the surface of stool probably is coming from lower \\nin the colon. When upper GI tract bleeding is suspected, a \\nnasogastric tube may be placed and gastric contents aspirated \\nfor evidence of recent bleeding.\\nThe location and hemodynamic significance of the bleed -\\ning can also be assessed by history and examination. The \\nparents should be asked to quantify the bleeding. Details of \\nassociated symptoms should be sought. Assessment of the vital \\nsigns including orthostatic changes when bleeding volume is \\nlarge, pulses, capillary refill, and assessment of pallor of the \\nmucous membranes provides valuable information. Laboratory \\nassessment and imaging studies should be ordered as indicated \\n(Table 126.12).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of GI bleeding should begin with an initial assessment, \\nrapid stabilization, and a logical sequence of diagnostic tests. \\nWhen a treatable cause is identified, specific therapy should \\ncause.

A test for \\noccult blood is worth performing whenever the diagnosis is \\nin doubt.\\nThe GI tract may not be the source of the observed fecal \\nblood. A history of cough and examination of the mouth, \\nnostrils, and lungs is needed to exclude these as a source of \\nhematemesis.

Bacteria (Streptococcus \\nmutans) that can adhere to and colonize the teeth, survive at \\nlow pH, and produce acids during fermentation of carbohydrates \\ncause dental caries. The diet has a significant role. A classic \\nexample is “bottle mouth, ” or baby bottle caries. This condition \\nresults when infants are allowed to have a bottle in the mouth \\nfor prolonged periods, especially during sleep, and with sweet \\nbeverages or milk in the bottle. Bacteria then have continuous \\nsubstrate for acid production and can destroy multiple teeth, \\nespecially the upper incisors. Sticky sweet foods, such as candy, \\nhave the same effect.\\nEpidemiology and Treatment\\nRisk of caries is associated with lack of dental care and poor \\nsocioeconomic status and, predictably, is greatest in developing \\ncountries. Baby bottle caries are seen in 50-70% of low-income \\ninfants. Treatment of caries is with dental restorative surgery. \\nThe carious portion is removed and filled with silver amalgam \\nor plastic. If the damage is severe, a protective crown may be \\nrequired; extraction of the tooth may be necessary when not \\nsalvageable. If not properly treated, dental decay results in \\ninflammation and infection of the dental pulp and surrounding \\nalveolar bone, which can lead to abscess and facial space \\ninfections.\\nPrevention\\nAvoiding inappropriate use of bottles and excessive sweets is \\na commonsense remedy for baby bottle caries. Oral hygiene \\noffers some protection, but young children (<8 years old) do \\nnot have the ability to brush their own teeth adequately; brushing \\nshould be done by the parents. Fluoride supplementation of \\ncommunity water supplies to a concentration of 1 p pm is highly \\neffective in reducing dental caries. Home water supplies, such \\nas from a well, should have the fluoride content tested before \\nsupplements are prescribed. If the child spends part of the day \\nat another location, the total fluoride concentration from all \\nsources must be considered before prescribing any oral supple-\\nments. Excessive fluoride supplementation causes fluorosis, a \\nlargely cosmetic defect of chalky white marks and brown staining \\nof the teeth.\\nCHAPTER 127 \\nOral Cavity\\nEFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC DISEASE ON  \\nTHE ORAL CAVITY\\nMedications taken for a variety of conditions may cause oral \\nabnormalities. Drugs with anticholinergic properties diminish \\nsaliva production and increase the risk of dental caries and \\nparotitis. Tetracyclines taken before the eruption of the per-\\nmanent teeth stain the enamel. Excessive fluoride in vitamin \\npreparations or in drinking water can result in mottled teeth. \\nGingival hypertrophy may be caused by cyclosporine, phenytoin, \\nand calcium channel blockers.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to sub -\\nstantial enamel erosion and caries. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia \\ncan result in discoloration of the deciduous teeth. Renal \\nfailure is associated with mottled enamel of the permanent \\nteeth. Congenital syphilis causes marked abnormalities in the \\nshape of teeth, especially incisors and molars. Celiac disease \\ncan result in enamel defects. Crohn disease is associated \\nwith oral aphthous ulcers. Abnormal pigmentation of the \\nlips and buccal mucosa is seen with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome \\nand Addison disease. Candidiasis is seen commonly with \\nimmunodeficiency disorders and diabetes. Leukemic infil-\\ntrates result in gum hyperplasia and bleeding; treatment of \\nneoplastic conditions can cause severe mucositis. Some tumors, \\nincluding lymphoma, may present as mass lesions of the  \\nbuccal cavity.\\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is associated with abnormal dentin \\nand risk of caries. Children with ectodermal dysplasias commonly \\nhave malformed or missing teeth. Pierre Robin and Stickler \\nsyndromes are associated with micrognathia and cleft palate. \\nDisorders resulting in facial dysmorphism can have a profound \\neffect on dental occlusion and mandibular function. Examples \\ninclude mandibulofacial dysostosis, Crouzon syndrome, condi-\\ntions associated with dwarfism, and others.\\nDECIDUOUS AND PRIMARY TEETH\\nMost infants are born without teeth. Natal teeth are present at \\nbirth, are usually supernumerary, and may be poorly attached. \\nUsually, no treatment is necessary, but removal by a dentist \\nmay be needed if they are causing difficulties with feeding or \\ninjuries to the tongue. Table 127.1 presents the ages when normal \\ndeciduous teeth are acquired. The lower central incisors are \\ntypically the first to erupt, followed by the upper central incisors, \\nlateral incisors, first molars, and bicuspids. Delayed eruption \\nmay occur in association with hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, \\nosteopetrosis, Gaucher disease, Down syndrome, cleidocranial \\ndysplasia, and rickets. Deciduous teeth begin to be replaced \\nby the permanent teeth at around age 6 years. The sequence \\nof replacement is similar to that of the appearance of deciduous \\nteeth.\\nDENTAL CARIES\\nEtiology\\nDental caries, commonly referred to as “cavities, ” occurs as a \\nresult of interactions between the tooth enamel, dietary car -\\nbohydrates, and oral flora.

Fluoride varnish is a concentrated fluoride preparation \\nthat adheres to the teeth on contact with saliva. It is painted \\nonto the teeth with a small brush, after first drying the tooth \\nwith a gauze pad, and has a prolonged cavity-prevention effect.\\nCLEFT LIP AND PALATE\\nEpidemiology\\nCleft lip and palate occur separately or together and affect \\napproximately 1 in 700 infants. It is more common in Asians \\n(1 :  500) a nd least common in Africans (1  :  2,500). C lefting occurs \\nwith two possible patterns: isolated soft tissue cleft palate or \\ncleft lip with or without associated clefts of the hard palate. \\nIsolated cleft palate is associated with a higher risk of other \\ncongenital malformations. The combined cleft lip/palate type \\nhas a male predominance.\\nEtiology\\nCleft lip is due to hypoplasia of the mesenchymal tissues with \\nsubsequent failure of fusion. There is a strong genetic component; \\nthe risk is highest in children with affected first-degree relatives. \\nMonozygotic twins are affected with only 60% concordance, \\nsuggesting other nongenomic factors. Environmental factors \\nduring gestation also increase risk, including drugs (phenytoin, \\nvalproic acid, thalidomide), maternal alcohol and tobacco use, \\ndioxins and other herbicides, and possibly high altitude. \\nChromosomal and nonchromosomal syndromes are associated \\nwith clefting, as are specific genes in some families.\\nClinical Manifestations and Treatment\\nCleft lip can be unilateral or bilateral and associated with cleft  \\npalate and defects of the alveolar ridge and dentition. When \\npresent, palatal defects allow direct communication between \\nthe nasal and oral cavities, creating problems with speech and \\nfeeding. Management includes squeeze-bottle feedings, special \\nnipples, nipples with attached shields to seal the palate, and \\ngastrostomy in severe cases. Surgical closure of the cleft lip is \\nusually done by 3 months of age. Closure of the palate follows, \\nusually before 1 year of age. Missing teeth are replaced by \\nprostheses. Cosmetic results are often good, but depend on the \\nseverity of the defect.\\nComplications\\nSpeech is nasal as a result of the cleft palate. Surgical treatment \\nis effective, but sometimes does not restore palatal function \\ncompletely. Speech therapy or, occasionally, the use of a speech-\\nassisting appliance may help. Frequent episodes of otitis media \\nare common, as are defects of teeth and the alveolar ridge.\\nTHRUSH\\nEpidemiology\\nOropharyngeal Candida albicans infection, or thrush, is common \\nin healthy neonates.

In infancy, GER is not always an \\nabnormality. Physiological GER (“spitting up”) is normal in \\ninfants younger than 8-12 months old. Nearly half of all infants \\nare reported to spit up between 2 and 4 months of age.

As infants grow, they spend more \\ntime upright, eat more solid foods, develop a longer and larger \\ndiameter esophagus, have a larger and more compliant stomach, \\nand experience lower caloric needs per unit of body weight. \\nAs a result, most infants stop spitting up by 9-12 months of \\nage.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In young children, \\nit may present with oral aversion, vomiting, and failure to thrive. \\nIn school-age children, it may present with vague abdominal \\npain or vomiting. In adolescents and adults, it presents with \\ndysphagia and food impactions. These symptoms are attributed \\nto the inflammatory response in the esophagus leading to edema \\nand poor esophageal motility.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nDiagnosis requires multilevel esophageal biopsies via flexible \\nendoscopy with the finding of more than 15 eosinophils per \\nhigh-power field (Fig. 128.1). Treatment with high-dose proton \\npump inhibitor therapy is recommended to exclude the pos-\\nsibility that findings are secondary to severe acidic esophageal \\ninjury or by evaluating for acid reflux by pH probe testing. \\nGross findings at endoscopy may include normal appearance, \\nor esophageal furrowing, trachealization, and eosinophilic \\nabscesses (Fig. 128.2).

The passage of \\nthe tube is blocked at the level of the atresia. A chest x-ray \\nreveals the tube coiled in the esophageal pouch. Air can be \\ninjected through the tube to outline the atretic pouch. Barium \\nshould not be used because of extreme risk of aspiration, but \\na tiny amount of dilute water-soluble contrast agent can be \\ngiven carefully, then suctioned when the defect is clearly shown.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nThe treatment of TEF is surgical. The fistula is divided and \\nligated. The esophageal ends are approximated and anastomosed. \\nIn some cases, primary anastomosis cannot be performed \\nbecause of a long gap between the proximal and distal esophagus. \\nVarious techniques have been described to treat this problem, \\nincluding pulling up the stomach, elongating the esophagus \\nby myotomy, and simply delaying esophageal anastomosis and \\nproviding continuous suction to the upper pouch while allowing \\nfor growth.\\nComplications\\nThe surgically reconstructed esophagus is not normal and is \\nprone to poor motility, GER, anastomotic stricture, recurrent \\nfistula, and leakage.

Chronic \\ninflammation of the esophagus can predispose to esophageal \\nstrictures and possibly dysplasia.\\nESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA AND \\nTRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe esophagus and trachea develop in close proximity to each \\nother during weeks 4-6 of fetal life. Defects in the mesenchyme \\nseparating these two structures result in a tracheoesophageal \\nfistula (TEF), often in association with other anomalies (renal, \\nheart, spine, limbs). This defect occurs in about 1 in 3,000 live \\nbirths. TEF is not thought to be a genetic defect.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe most common forms of TEF occur with esophageal atresia; \\nthe “H-type” TEF without atresia is uncommon, as is esophageal \\natresia without TEF (Fig. 128.3). Associated defects include \\nthe V ACTERL association—vertebral anomalies (70%), anal \\natresia (imperforate anus) (50%), cardiac anomalies (30%), TEF \\n(70%), renal anomalies (50%), and limb anomalies (polydactyly, \\nforearm defects, absent thumbs, syndactyly) (70%). A single-\\nartery umbilical cord is often present. Infants with esophageal \\natresia have a history of polyhydramnios, exhibit drooling, and \\nhave mucus and saliva bubbling from the nose and mouth. \\nPatients with a TEF are vulnerable to aspiration pneumonia. \\nWhen TEF is suspected, the first feeding should be delayed \\nuntil a diagnostic study is performed.\\nEsophageal atresia\\nwith distal TEF\\n(85%)\\nEsophageal atresia\\nwith no TEF\\n(8%)\\nH-type TEF\\n(4%)\\nEsophageal atresia\\nwith proximal TEF\\n(2%)\\nEsophageal atresia with \\nproximal and distal TEF\\n(1%)\\nFIGURE 128.3 Various types of tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF) with relative frequency (%). \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Less caustic agents, \\nsuch as bleach and detergents, cause less serious injury. Pill \\nulcers occur when certain medications (tetracyclines and \\nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are swallowed \\nwithout sufficient liquids, allowing prolonged direct contact \\nof the pill with the esophageal mucosa.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nCaustic burns cause immediate and severe mouth pain.

The most \\ncommon objects are coins. Smaller coins may pass harmlessly \\ninto the stomach, where they rarely cause symptoms. Other \\ncommon esophageal foreign bodies include food items, small \\ntoys or toy parts, disk batteries, and other small household \\nitems. Children with a prior history of esophageal atresia or \\nwith poor motility secondary to GER or EoE are more prone to \\nfood impactions, which seldom occur in the normal esophagus.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nSome children are asymptomatic, but most exhibit some degree \\nof drooling, food refusal, or chest discomfort. Older children \\nusually can point to the region of the chest where they feel the \\nobject to be lodged. Respiratory symptoms tend to be minimal, \\nbut cough or wheezing may be present, especially when the \\nesophagus is completely blocked by a large object, such as a \\npiece of meat, which presses on the trachea.\\nDiagnosis\\nPlain chest and abdominal radiographs should be taken when \\nforeign body ingestion is suspected. Metallic objects are easily \\nvisualized. A plastic object often can be seen if the child is \\ngiven a small amount of dilute x-ray contrast material to drink, \\nalthough endoscopy is probably safer and more definitive.\\nTreatment\\nEndoscopy is ultimately necessary in most cases to remove a \\nretained esophageal foreign body. Various devices can be used \\nto remove the object, depending on its size, shape, and location. \\nCoins usually are grasped with special-purpose forceps and \\nremoved. Nets, baskets, and snares also are available. Whenever \\nobjects that may threaten the airway are being recovered, \\nendoscopy should be performed with endotracheal intubation \\nand under general anesthesia. Removal is usually not necessary \\nif the object is small and in the stomach as it will most likely \\npass without complication. Endoscopy is emergent for removal \\nof any esophageal foreign body if symptomatic or if the ingested \\nforeign body is a suspected disc battery in the esophagus or \\nmultiple magnets located in the upper intestinal tract.\\nComplications\\nSharp objects may lacerate or perforate the esophagus; smooth \\nobjects present for a long time also may result in perforation \\ndue to ulceration. Corrosive objects, such as zinc-containing \\npennies and disc batteries, can cause considerable local tissue \\ninjury and esophageal perforation. Magnets can lead to perfora-\\ntion and fistula formation when they connect between adjacent \\nloops of bowel.\\nCAUSTIC INJURIES AND PILL ULCERS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nIn adolescents, caustic ingestion injuries are usually the result \\nof suicide attempts.

It occurs in 6-8 per 1,000 live births, has a 5-to-1 \\nmale predominance, and is more common in first-born children. \\nIts cause is unknown.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nInfants with pyloric stenosis typically begin vomiting during the \\nfirst weeks of life, but onset may be delayed. The emesis becomes \\nincreasingly frequent and forceful as time passes. Vomiting \\ndiffers from spitting up because of its extremely forceful and \\noften projectile nature. The vomited material never contains \\nbile, because the gastric outlet obstruction is proximal to the \\nduodenum. This feature differentiates pyloric stenosis from \\nmost other obstructive lesions of early childhood. Affected \\ninfants are ravenously hungry early in the course of the illness \\nbut become more lethargic with increasing malnutrition and \\ndehydration. The stomach becomes massively enlarged with \\nretained food and secretions, and gastric peristaltic waves are \\noften visible in the left upper quadrant. A hypertrophied pylorus \\n(the “olive”) may be palpated. As the illness progresses, very \\nlittle of each feeding is able to pass through the pylorus, and \\nthe child becomes progressively thinner and more dehydrated.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAlkalemia\\nFIGURE 128.4 Pyloric Stenosis.

The length of the pylorus is marked by the red \\narrows; the wall thickness is marked by the yellow arrows. \\nRepetitive vomiting of purely gastric contents results in loss of \\nhydrochloric acid; the classic laboratory finding is a hypochlo-\\nremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis  with elevated blood \\nurea nitrogen (BUN) secondary to dehydration. Jaundice with \\nunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may also occur. Plain \\nabdominal x-rays typically show a huge stomach and diminished \\nor absent gas in the intestine (Fig. 128.4).

Tetracycline is useful in adults but should be avoided \\nin children less than 8 years of age. In the absence of H. pylori, \\nesophagitis and peptic ulcer disease are treated with a proton-\\npump inhibitor, which yields higher rates of healing than H2 \\nreceptor antagonists. Gastric and duodenal ulcers heal in 4-8 \\nweeks in at least 80% of patients. Esophagitis requires 4-5 months \\nof proton pump inhibitor treatment for optimal healing.\\nCYCLIC VOMITING SYNDROME\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nin children. Helicobacter pylori is responsible for more than \\nhalf of ulcers in the stomach and duodenum in adults. H. pylori \\nplays a significant but lesser role in childhood ulcer disease. \\nRisk factors for acquisition of H. pylori are low socioeconomic \\nstatus and poor sanitation, with the highest incidence in \\ndeveloping countries. Nonulcer dyspepsia  includes upper \\nabdominal symptoms (pain, bloating, nausea, early satiety) in \\nthe absence of gastric or duodenal ulceration. Nonulcer dys-\\npepsia is not associated with H. pylori infection. GER (see \\nChapter 128) allows acidic gastric contents to injure the \\nesophagus, resulting in esophagitis. Esophagitis is characterized \\nby retrosternal and epigastric burning pain and is best diagnosed \\nby endoscopy. It can range from minimal, with only erythema \\nand microscopic inflammation on biopsy, to superficial erosions \\nand finally, to frank ulceration.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nTypical symptoms are listed in Table 128.3. The presence of \\nrecurrent burning epigastric and retrosternal pain is a risk factor \\nfor esophagitis. With duodenal ulcers, pain typically occurs \\nseveral hours after meals and often awakens patients at night. \\nEating tends to relieve the pain. Gastric ulcers differ in that \\npain is commonly aggravated by eating, resulting in weight \\nloss. GI bleeding from either can occur. Many patients report \\nsymptom relief with antacids or acid blockers.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nEndoscopy can be used to diagnose the underlying condition. \\nEmpiric therapy with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors \\ncan be used but may delay diagnosis of conditions such as H. \\npylori. For patients with chronic epigastric pain, the possibilities \\nof inflammatory bowel disease, anatomical abnormality such \\nas malrotation, pancreatitis, and biliary disease should be ruled \\nout by appropriate testing when suspected (see Chapter 126 \\nand Table 128.3 for recommended studies). Testing for H. pylori \\ncan be performed by biopsy during endoscopy with use of a \\nurease test or presence histologically on tissue.

Beginning at around \\n10 weeks’ gestation, the bowel re-enters the abdomen and rotates \\ncounterclockwise around the superior mesenteric artery until \\nthe cecum arrives in the right lower quadrant. The duodenum \\nrotates behind the artery and terminates at the ligament of \\nTreitz in the left upper quadrant. The base of the mesentery \\nbecomes fixed along a broad attachment posteriorly, running \\nfrom the cecum to the ligament of Treitz (Fig. 129.1A). When \\nCyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) presents with intermittent \\nepisodes of prolonged nausea and vomiting with periods of \\nhealth in between. It can occur at any age but is diagnosed \\nmost frequently in preschool to school-age children. It is \\nthought to be a migraine variant; many patients have a \\npositive family history of migraines, and some with CVS will \\neventually develop migraine headaches. Triggers to an episode \\noften include viral illnesses, lack of sleep, stressful or exciting \\nevents (holidays, birthdays, vacations), physical exhaustion,  \\nand menses.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nEpisodes can start at any time but will often start in the early \\nmorning hours. Episodes are similar to each other in timing \\nand duration. Repetitive vomiting can last hours to days. Patients \\ncan also have abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headaches. Those \\naffected are typically pale, listless, and prefer to be left alone. \\nThey may have photo- or phonophobia.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThere are no specific tests for CVS, which is diagnosed based \\non the history and the exclusion of other disorders. Diagnoses \\nthat should be considered include malrotation with intermittent \\nvolvulus, uteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, EoE, intra-\\ncranial mass lesions, and metabolic disorders.

The bowel is untwisted, and Ladd bands \\nand other abnormal membranous attachments are divided. The \\nmesentery is spread out and flattened against the posterior wall \\nof the abdomen by moving the cecum to the left side of the \\nabdomen. Sutures may be used to hold the bowel in position, \\nbut postoperative adhesions tend to hold the mesentery in \\nplace, resulting in a broad attachment and eliminating the risk \\nof recurrent volvulus.

Incomplete rotation occurs when the cecum stops \\nnear the right upper quadrant and the duodenum fails to move \\nbehind the mesenteric artery; this results in an extremely narrow \\nmesenteric root (see Fig. 129.1B) that makes the child susceptible \\nto midgut volvulus, causing intestinal obstruction or mesenteric \\nartery occlusion and intestinal infarction (Fig. 129.2). It is also \\ncommon for abnormal mesenteric attachments (Ladd bands) \\nto extend from the cecum across the duodenum, causing partial \\nobstruction.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nAbout 60% of children with malrotation present with symptoms \\nof bilious vomiting during the first month of life. The remaining \\n40% presents later in infancy or childhood. The emesis initially \\nmay be due to obstruction by Ladd bands without volvulus. \\nWhen midgut volvulus occurs, the venous drainage of the gut \\nis impaired; congestion results in ischemia, pain, tenderness, \\nand often bloody emesis and stools. The bowel undergoes \\nischemic necrosis, and the child may appear septic. Physicians \\nmust be alert to the possibility of volvulus in patients with \\nvomiting and fussiness or abdominal pain.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nPlain abdominal x-rays generally show evidence of obstruction. \\nAbdominal ultrasound may show evidence of malrotation. An \\nupper gastrointestinal (GI) series shows the absence of a typical \\nduodenal “C-loop, ” with the duodenum instead remaining on \\nthe right side of the abdomen. Abnormal placement of the \\ncecum on follow-through (or by contrast enema) confirms the \\ndiagnosis. Laboratory studies are nonspecific, showing evidence \\nof dehydration, electrolyte loss, or evidence of sepsis. A decreas-\\ning platelet count is a common indicator of bowel ischemia.\\nCongenital partial or complete blockage of the intestine is a \\ndevelopmental defect that occurs in about 1 in 1,500 live births. \\nAtresia occurs in several forms (Fig. 129.3). One or more \\nsegments of bowel may be missing completely, there may be \\nvarying degrees of obstruction caused by webs or stenosis, or \\nthere may be obliteration of the lumen in cordlike bowel \\nremnants. The end result is obstruction with upstream dilation \\nof the bowel and small, disused intestine distally. When obstruc-\\ntion is complete or high grade, bilious vomiting and abdominal \\ndistention are present in the newborn period. In lesser cases, \\nas in “windsock” types of intestinal webs, the obstruction is \\npartial, and symptoms are more subtle. Duodenal atresia is \\nassociated with other anomalies in more than half of infants. \\nDown syndrome is the most common associated disorder but \\ncan also be associated with biliary, cardiac, renal, or vertebral \\nanomalies. Jejunal and ileal atresia can be seen in meconium \\nileus secondary to cystic fibrosis.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nIntestinal atresia presents with a history of polyhydramnios, \\nabdominal distention, and bilious vomiting in the neonatal \\nperiod. If intestinal perforation is present, peritonitis and sepsis \\nmay develop.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nPlain abdominal x-rays may localize the area of atresia and \\nidentify evidence of perforation, such as free air or calcifications \\ntypical of meconium peritonitis. Duodenal atresia appears as \\na double-bubble sign (gas in the stomach and enlarged proximal \\nduodenum), with no gas distally. Atresias of the distal intestine \\nare characterized by longer segments of dilated, air-filled bowel. \\nContrast studies are helpful if plain films are not sufficient. \\nAtresia may be a complication of meconium ileus associated \\nwith cystic fibrosis. Laboratory evaluation for cystic fibrosis \\n(see Chapter 137) is indicated in cases of small bowel atresia. \\nA complete blood count, serum electrolytes, liver functions, \\nand amylase should be measured to identify dehydration, \\npancreatitis, and other complications.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Genetic factors play a role in susceptibility, \\nwith significantly higher risk if there is a family history of IBD. \\nHaving a first-degree relative with IBD increases the risk about \\n30-fold. Susceptibility has been linked to some human leukocyte \\nantigen (HLA) subtypes, and linkage analysis has identified \\nmultiple other susceptibility loci on several chromosomes. \\nEnvironmental factors (not yet identified) also seem to play a \\nrole because there is often nonconcordance among monozygotic \\ntwins. Dietary and infectious triggers have been proposed but \\nnot yet proven. Smoking increases the risk as well as the severity \\nof CD and decreases the risk for UC.\\nClinical manifestations depend on the region of involve -\\nment. UC involves only the colon, whereas CD can include the \\nentire gut from mouth to anus. Colitis from either condition \\nresults in diarrhea; blood and mucus in the stool; urgency; and \\ntenesmus, a sensation of incomplete emptying after defecation. \\nWhen colitis is severe, the child often awakens from sleep to \\npass stool. Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening complication \\ncharacterized by fever, abdominal distention and pain, massively \\ndilated colon, anemia, and low serum albumin owing to fecal \\nprotein losses. Symptoms of colitis always are present in UC and \\nusually suggest the diagnosis early in its course. Extraintestinal \\nmanifestations of UC occur in a few patients and may include \\nprimary sclerosing cholangitis, arthritis, uveitis, and pyoderma \\ngangrenosum (Table 129.1).\\nSymptoms can be subtle in CD. Small bowel involvement \\nin CD is associated with loss of appetite, crampy postprandial \\npain, poor growth, delayed puberty, fever, anemia, and lethargy. \\nSymptoms may be present for some time before the diagnosis \\nis made. Severe CD with fibrosis may cause partial or complete \\nlong segments of small bowel also are aganglionic. “Ultrashort” \\nsegment involves only a few centimeters of distal rectum. About \\n95% of normal infants pass stool spontaneously by 24 hours of \\nage; 95% of infants with Hirschsprung disease do not. Symptoms \\nof distal bowel obstruction occur with distention and bilious \\nvomiting. If the diagnosis is not made quickly, enterocolitis \\ncan result, associated with a high rate of mortality. Diagnosis \\nis based on examination and one or more diagnostic studies. \\nAbdominal distention is present in most cases. Digital rectal \\nexamination reveals an empty rectum that clenches around \\nthe examiner’s finger, giving the impression of an elongated \\nsphincter. When the finger is withdrawn, a powerful gush of \\nretained stool is often expelled. A deep rectal biopsy specimen \\nobtained surgically or by using a suction biopsy instrument is \\nrequired for diagnosis. When no ganglion cells are shown in \\nthe submucosal plexus, accompanied by nerve trunk hyper-\\nplasia, the diagnosis is certain. Barium enema and anorectal \\nmanometry may be used before biopsy, but false-negative and \\nfalse-positive results can occur. Therapy is surgical. When the \\nbowel is markedly distended or inflamed, an initial colostomy \\nusually is performed above the aganglionic segment, followed \\nweeks later by one of several definitive repair procedures. The \\ntransanal pull-through excises the aganglionic bowel and creates \\na primary colorectal anastomosis without laparotomy. This \\nprocedure can be considered in patients with uncomplicated \\ninvolvement limited to the rectosigmoid region.\\nMeckel diverticulum is a remnant of the fetal omphalo-\\nmesenteric duct and is an outpouching of the distal ileum \\npresent in 1-2% of the population. Although most diverticula \\nare asymptomatic throughout life, some cause massive, painless \\nGI bleeding. Ectopic gastric tissue within the diverticulum causes \\nulceration of mucosa in the adjacent ileum. Meckel diverticulum \\nmay be a lead point for intussusception or may enable twisting \\n(volvulus) of neighboring bowel around its vascular supply. \\nDiverticulitis mimics appendicitis. Diagnosis may be made in \\nmost cases by technetium scan (Meckel scan), which labels the \\nacid-producing mucosa. Because not all diverticula are seen, \\nultrasound, barium enteroclysis, or video capsule endoscopy \\nmay be useful. When the level of suspicion is high, surgical \\nor laparoscopic investigation is warranted.

Surgical colectomy \\nwith ileoanal anastomosis is an option for unresponsive severe \\ndisease or electively to end chronic symptoms and to reduce \\nthe risk of colon cancer, which is increased in patients with \\nUC.\\nCrohn Disease\\nInflammation in CD typically responds less well to amino -\\nsalicylates; oral or IV steroids are more important in inducing \\nremission. To avoid the need for repetitive steroid therapy, \\nimmunosuppressive drugs, usually either azathioprine, \\n6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate, are often started soon after \\ndiagnosis. CD that is difficult to control may be treated with \\nagents that block the action of TNFα such as infliximab or \\nadalimumab. Other antibodies that inhibit white blood cell \\n(WBC) migration or action, such as vedolizumab, also show \\npromise. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be an effective therapy \\nfor CD. Patients take formula as their sole source of nutrition \\nfor months as a steroid-sparing therapy. Other diets such as \\nthe specific carbohydrate diet continue to be studied as a possible \\ntherapy. As with UC, surgery is sometimes necessary, usually \\nbecause of obstructive symptoms, abscess, or severe, unremitting \\nsymptoms.

Starchy foods that are safe \\ninclude rice, soy, tapioca, buckwheat, potatoes, and (pure) oats. \\nMany resources also are available via the Internet to help families \\ncope with the large changes in diet that are required. Most \\npatients respond clinically within a few weeks with weight gain, \\nimproved appetite, and improved sense of well-being. Histologi-\\ncal improvement lags behind clinical response, requiring several \\nmonths to normalize.\\nMILK AND SOY PROTEIN INTOLERANCE \\n(ALLERGIC COLITIS)\\nSee Chapter 34.\\nINTUSSUSCEPTION\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nIntussusception is the “telescoping” of a segment of proximal \\nbowel (the intussusceptum) into downstream bowel (the intus-\\nsuscipiens). Most cases occur in infants 1-2 years old; in this \\nage group, nearly all cases are idiopathic. Viral-induced lymphoid \\nhyperplasia may produce a lead point in these children. In \\nolder children, the proportion of cases caused by a pathological \\nlead point increases. In young children, ileocolonic intussuscep-\\ntion is common; the ileum invaginates into the colon, beginning \\nat or near the ileocecal valve. When pathological lead points \\nare present, the intussusception may be ileoileal, jejunoileal, \\nor jejunojejunal.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nCELIAC DISEASE\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nCeliac disease is an injury to the mucosa of the small intestine \\ncaused by the ingestion of gluten (a protein component) from \\nwheat, rye, barley, and related grains. In its severe form, celiac \\ndisease causes malabsorption and malnutrition. The availability \\nof more sensitive and specific serological testing has revealed \\nmany patients with few or no GI symptoms who have early, \\nattenuated, or latent disease. Incidence of celiac disease is \\nestimated at 1%, but only a small proportion has been diagnosed. \\nThe disease is seen in association with type 1 diabetes, thyroiditis, \\nTurner syndrome, and trisomy 21.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nDiarrhea\\nPubertal Delay\\nFailure to Thrive\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nGastrointestinal Bleeding\\nIrritable Infant\\nSymptoms can begin at any age when gluten-containing foods \\nare given. Diarrhea, abdominal bloating, failure to thrive, \\nirritability, decreased appetite, and ascites caused by hypopro-\\nteinemia are classic. Children may be minimally symptomatic \\nor may be severely malnourished. Constipation is found in a \\nfew patients, probably because of reduced intake. A careful \\ninspection of the child’s growth curve and evaluation for reduced \\nsubcutaneous fat and abdominal distention are crucial. Celiac \\ndisease should be considered in any child with chronic abdomi-\\nnal complaints, short stature, poor weight gain, or delayed \\npuberty. Extraintestinal manifestations include osteopenia, \\narthritis or arthralgias, ataxia, dental enamel defects, elevated \\nliver enzymes, dermatitis herpetiformis, and erythema nodosum.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nSerological markers include IgA antiendomysial antibody and \\nIgA tissue transglutaminase antibody. Because IgA deficiency \\nis common in celiac disease, total serum IgA also must be \\nmeasured to document the accuracy of these tests. In the absence \\nof IgA deficiency, either test yields a sensitivity and specificity \\nof 95%. An endoscopic small bowel biopsy is essential to \\nconfirm the diagnosis and should be performed while the patient \\nis still ingesting gluten. The biopsy specimen shows various \\ndegrees of villous atrophy (short or absent villi), mucosal \\ninflammation, crypt hyperplasia, and increased numbers of \\nintraepithelial lymphocytes. When there is any question about \\nresponse to treatment, a repeat biopsy specimen may be obtained \\nseveral months later. Other laboratory studies should be per-\\nformed to rule out complications, including complete blood \\ncount, calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, iron, total protein and \\nalbumin, and liver function tests. Mild elevations of the trans-\\naminases are common and should normalize with dietary \\ntherapy.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment consists of complete elimination of gluten from the \\ndiet. Consultation with a dietitian experienced in celiac disease \\nAn infant with intussusception has sudden onset of crampy \\nabdominal pain; the infant’s knees draw up, and the infant cries \\nout and exhibits pallor with a colicky pattern occurring every \\n15-20 minutes. Feedings are refused. As the intussusception \\nprogresses and obstruction becomes prolonged, bilious vomiting \\nbecomes prominent and the dilated, fatigued intestine generates \\nless pressure and less pain. As the intussuscepted bowel is pulled \\nfurther and further into the downstream intestine by motility, \\nthe mesentery is pulled with it and becomes stretched and \\ncompressed. The venous outflow from the intussusceptum is \\nobstructed, leading to edema, weeping of fluid, and congestion \\nwith bleeding. Third space fluid losses and “currant jelly” stools \\nresult. Another unexpected feature of intussusception is lethargy. \\nBetween episodes of pain, the infant is glassy-eyed and groggy \\nand appears to have been sedated. A sausage-shaped mass caused \\nby the swollen, intussuscepted bowel may be palpable in the \\nright upper quadrant or epigastrium.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThe diagnosis depends on the direct demonstration of bowel-\\nwithin-bowel.

Examination of the patient \\nreveals a tender right lower quadrant. Voluntary guarding is \\npresent initially, progressing to rigidity, then to rebound tender-\\nness with rupture and peritonitis. These classic findings may \\nnot be present, especially in young children or if the appendix \\nis retrocecal, covered by omentum, or in another unusual \\nlocation. Clinical prediction rules have been developed for the \\ndiagnosis of appendicitis. The Alvarado/MANTRELS rule is \\nscored by 1 point for each of the following: migration of pain \\nto the right lower quadrant, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, rebound \\npain, temperature of at least 37.3°C, and WBC shift to greater \\nthan 75% neutrophils; 2 points are given for each of tenderness \\nin the right lower quadrant and leukocytosis greater than \\n10,000/µL. Children with a score of 4 or less are unlikely to \\nhave appendicitis; a score of 7 or greater increases the likelihood \\nthat the patient has appendicitis. When classic history and \\nphysical examination findings are present, the patient is taken \\nto the operating room. When doubt exists, imaging is helpful \\nto rule out complications (right lower quadrant abscess, liver \\ndisease) and other disorders, such as mesenteric adenitis and \\novarian or fallopian tube disorders. If the evaluation is negative \\nand some doubt remains, the child should be admitted to the \\nhospital for close observation and serial examinations.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThe history and examination are often enough to make the \\ndiagnosis, but laboratory and imaging studies are helpful when \\nthe diagnosis is uncertain (Table 129.3). A WBC count greater \\nthan 10,000/mm3 is found in 89% of patients with appendicitis \\nand 93% with perforated appendicitis. This criterion is met by \\n62% of abdominal pain patients without appendicitis. Urinalysis \\nis done to rule out urinary tract infection, and x-rays of the \\nchest or the kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) rule out lower lobe \\npneumonia masquerading as abdominal pain. Amylase, lipase, \\nand liver enzymes are done to look for pancreatic or liver and \\ngallbladder disease. The plain abdominal x-ray may reveal a \\ncalcified fecalith, which strongly suggests the diagnosis. When \\nthese studies are inconclusive, imaging is indicated with an \\nabdominal ultrasound or CT scan, which may reveal the presence \\nof an enlarged, thick-walled appendix with surrounding fluid. \\nA diameter of more than 6  mm is considered diagnostic.\\nultrasound. If the ultrasound is positive, or if good visualization \\nhas not been achieved, a pneumatic or contrast enema under \\nfluoroscopy is indicated. This is a potentially useful way to both \\nidentify and treat intussusception. Air and barium can show the \\nintussusception quickly and, when administered with controlled \\npressure, usually can reduce it completely. The success rate for \\npneumatic reduction is higher than for hydrostatic reduction \\nwith barium and approaches 90%, if done when symptoms \\nhave been present for less than 24 hours. The pneumatic enema \\nhas the additional advantages over barium of not preventing \\nsubsequent radiologic studies and having no risk of causing \\nbarium peritonitis if perforation occurs. Nonoperative reduction \\nshould not be attempted if the patient is unstable or has evidence \\nof pre-existing perforation or peritonitis.\\nTreatment\\nTherapy must begin with placement of an IV catheter and a \\nnasogastric tube. Before radiologic intervention is attempted, \\nthe child must have adequate fluid resuscitation to correct the \\noften severe dehydration caused by vomiting and third space \\nlosses. Ultrasound may be performed before the fluid resuscita-\\ntion is complete. Surgical consultation should be obtained early \\nas the surgeon may prefer to be present during nonoperative \\nreduction. If pneumatic or hydrostatic reduction is successful, \\nthe child should be admitted to the hospital for overnight \\nobservation of possible recurrence (risk is 5-10%). If reduction \\nis not complete, emergency surgery is required. The surgeon \\nattempts gentle manual reduction but may need to resect the \\ninvolved bowel after failed radiologic reduction because of \\nsevere edema, perforation, a pathological lead point (polyp, \\nMeckel diverticulum), or necrosis.\\nAPPENDICITIS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nAppendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in child-\\nhood. The prevalence of appendicitis varies by age with the \\npeak in the second decade. Appendicitis begins with obstruction \\nof the lumen, most commonly by fecal matter (fecalith), but \\nappendiceal obstruction also can occur secondary to hyperplasia \\nof lymphoid tissue associated with viral infections or, rarely, \\nthe presence of neoplastic tissue, such as an appendiceal car-\\ncinoid tumor. Trapped bacteria proliferate and begin to invade \\nthe appendiceal wall, inducing inflammation and secretion. \\nThe obstructed appendix becomes engorged, its blood supply \\nis compromised, and it finally ruptures. The entire process is \\nrapid, with appendiceal rupture usually occurring within 48 \\nhours of the onset of symptoms.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nVomiting\\nTABLE 129.3 Diagnostic Studies in Suspected \\nAppendicitis\\nINITIAL LABORATORY TESTING\\nCBC with differential\\nUrinalysis\\nAmylase and lipase\\nALT, AST, GGT\\nFlat and upright abdominal radiographs (KUB)\\nFOLLOW-UP STUDIES*\\nAbdominal ultrasound\\nCT scan of abdomen\\n*Perform when diagnosis remains in doubt.\\nALT, Alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CBC, complete \\nblood count; CT, computed tomography; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase; KUB, \\nkidney-ureter-bladder.\\nClassic appendicitis begins with visceral pain, localized to the \\nperiumbilical region.

Only about \\n10-20% of all infants with the genetic defect exhibit neonatal \\ncholestasis. Of these affected infants, about 20-30% develop \\nchronic liver disease, which may result in cirrhosis and liver \\nfailure. Life-threatening α1-antitrypsin deficiency occurs \\nin only 3-5% of affected pediatric patients. α1-Antitrypsin \\ndeficiency is the leading metabolic disorder requiring liver  \\ntransplantation.\\nAlagille syndrome is characterized by chronic cholestasis \\nwith the unique liver biopsy finding of paucity of bile ducts in \\nthe portal triads. Associated abnormalities in some (syndromic) \\ntypes include peripheral pulmonic stenosis or other cardiac \\nanomalies; hypertelorism; unusual facies with deep-set eyes, \\nprominent forehead, and a pointed chin; butterfly vertebrae; \\nand a defect of the ocular limbus (posterior embryotoxon). \\nCholestasis is variable but is usually lifelong and associated \\nwith hypercholesterolemia and severe pruritus. Progression \\nto end-stage liver disease is uncommon. Liver transplanta-\\ntion sometimes is performed electively to relieve severe and \\nuncontrollable pruritus.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThe laboratory approach to diagnosis of a neonate with cho -\\nlestatic jaundice is presented in Table 130.2. Noninvasive studies \\nmay aid a rapid diagnosis. Early imaging studies are performed \\nto evaluate for biliary obstruction and other anatomical lesions \\nthat may be surgically treatable. When necessary to rule out \\nbiliary atresia or to obtain prognostic information, liver biopsy \\nis a final option (Fig. 130.2).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of extrahepatic biliary atresia is the surgical Kasai \\nprocedure, in which the fibrotic extrahepatic bile duct remnant \\nis removed and replaced with a roux-en-Y loop of jejunum. \\nThis operation must be performed before 3 months of age \\nto have the best chance of success. Even so, the success rate \\nis low; many children require liver transplantation. Some \\nmetabolic causes of neonatal cholestasis are treatable by dietary \\nmanipulation (galactosemia) or medication (tyrosinemia); all \\naffected patients require supportive care. This includes fat-\\nsoluble vitamin supplements (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and \\nformula containing medium-chain triglycerides, which can be \\nabsorbed without bile salt–induced micelles. Choleretic agents, \\nsuch as ursodeoxycholic acid, may improve bile flow in some  \\nconditions.\\nVIRAL HEPATITIS\\nSee Chapter 113.\\nFULMINANT LIVER FAILURE\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nFulminant liver failure is defined as severe liver disease \\nwith onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks after \\ninitial symptoms, in the absence of chronic liver disease. \\nEtiology includes viral hepatitis, metabolic disorders, \\nautoimmune hepatitis, ischemia, neoplastic disease, and toxins  \\n(Table 130.3).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of appendicitis is usually surgical. Laparoscopic \\nappendectomy is curative if performed before perforation. With \\nperforation, a course of postoperative IV antibiotics is required. \\nBroad-spectrum coverage is necessary to cover the mixed bowel \\nflora. In low-risk patients with nonperforated appendicitis, some \\ncenters have a nonsurgical approach and use high dose broad-\\nspectrum intravenous antibiotics in a hospital setting.\\nCHAPTER 130 \\nLiver Disease\\nCHOLESTASIS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nCholestasis is defined as reduced bile flow and is characterized \\nby elevation of the conjugated, or direct, bilirubin fraction. \\nThis condition must be distinguished from physiological \\nneonatal jaundice, in which the direct bilirubin is never elevated \\n(see Chapter 62). Neonatal jaundice that is secondary to \\nunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is the result of immature \\nhepatocellular excretory function or hemolysis, which increases \\nthe production of bilirubin. When direct bilirubin is elevated, \\nmany potentially serious disorders must be considered (Fig. \\n130.1, Table 130.1). Emphasis must be placed on the rapid \\ndiagnosis of treatable and potentially imminently lethal disor-\\nders, especially biliary atresia and metabolic disorders, such \\nas galactosemia or tyrosinemia.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nJaundice\\nThe jaundice of extrahepatic biliary atresia (biliary atresia) \\nusually is not evident immediately at birth, but develops in the \\nfirst week or two of life. The reason is that extrahepatic bile \\nducts are usually present at birth but are then destroyed by an \\nidiopathic inflammatory process. Aside from jaundice, these \\ninfants do not initially appear ill. The liver injury progresses \\nrapidly to cirrhosis; symptoms of portal hypertension with \\nsplenomegaly, ascites, muscle wasting, and poor weight gain \\nare evident by a few months of age. If surgical drainage is not \\nperformed successfully early in the course (ideally by 2 months), \\nprogression to liver failure is inevitable.\\nNeonatal hepatitis is characterized by an ill-appearing \\ninfant with an enlarged liver and jaundice. There is no specific \\ndiagnostic test. If liver biopsy is performed, the presence of \\nhepatocyte giant cells is characteristic. Cytomegalovirus, herpes \\nsimplex virus, and syphilis must be ruled out. Hepatobiliary \\nscintigraphy typically shows slow hepatic uptake with eventual \\nexcretion of isotope into the intestine.

In general, the rate of \\nprogression to end-stage liver disease is slow.\\nCHAPTER 131 \\nPancreatic Disease\\nPANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe cause of inadequate pancreatic digestive function in 95% \\nof cases is cystic fibrosis  (see Chapter 137). The defect in \\nCFTR chloride channel function results in thick secretions \\nin the lungs, intestines, pancreas, and bile ducts. In the \\npancreas, there is destruction of pancreatic function, often \\nbefore birth. Some mutations result in less severe defects in \\nCFTR function and later onset of lung disease and pancreatic \\ninsufficiency. Less common causes of pancreatic insufficiency \\nare Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and Pearson syndrome \\nin developed countries and severe malnutrition in developing  \\ncountries.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nFailure to Thrive\\nChildren with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency have many \\nbulky, foul-smelling stools each day, usually with visible oil or \\nfat. They typically have voracious appetites because of massive \\nmalabsorption of calories from fat, complex carbohydrates, \\nand proteins. Failure to thrive is uniformly present if diagnosis \\nand treatment are not accomplished rapidly. It is important to \\ndistinguish children with malabsorption due to pancreatic \\ndisease from children with intestinal disorders that interfere \\nwith digestion or absorption. Appropriate testing should be \\nperformed to rule out conditions such as celiac disease and \\ninflammatory bowel disease if any doubt about the state of \\npancreatic sufficiency exists.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nTesting of pancreatic function is difficult. Direct measurement \\nof enzyme concentrations in aspirated pancreatic juice is not \\nroutine and is technically difficult. Stools can be tested for the \\npresence of maldigested fat, which usually indicates poor fat \\ndigestion. Measuring fecal fat can give either a qualitative \\nassessment of fat absorption (fecal Sudan stain) or a semiquan-\\ntitative measurement (72-hour fecal fat determination) of fat \\nmaldigestion. Another way to assess pancreatic function is to \\ntest for the presence of pancreatic enzymes in the stool. Of \\nthese, measuring fecal elastase-1 by immunoassay seems to \\nbe the most accurate method of assessment. Depressed fecal \\nelastase-1 concentration correlates well with the presence of \\npancreatic insufficiency.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Pancreatic enzymes are available as capsules containing \\nenteric-coated microspheres. The coating on these spheres is \\ndesigned to protect the enzymes from gastric acid degradation. \\nFor children unable to swallow capsules, the contents may be \\nsprinkled on a spoonful of soft food, such as applesauce. Exces-\\nsive use of enzymes must be avoided because high doses (usually \\n>6,000 U/kg/m eal) can cause colonic fibrosis. In infants, typical \\ndosing is 2,000-4,000 U o f lipase/120  mL o f formula. In children \\nyounger than 4 years old, 1,000 U/kg/m eal is given. For older \\nchildren, 500 U/kg/m eal is usual. This dose may be adjusted \\nupward as required to control steatorrhea, but a dose of 2,500 U/\\nkg/meal should not be exceeded. Use of H2-receptor antagonists \\nor proton pump inhibitors can increase the efficacy of pancreatic \\nenzymes by enhancing their release from the microspheres and \\nreducing inactivation by acid.\\nACUTE PANCREATITIS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe exocrine pancreas produces numerous proteolytic enzymes, \\nincluding trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase. These \\nare produced as inactive proenzymes to protect the pancreas \\nfrom autodigestion. Trypsin is activated after leaving the \\npancreas by enterokinase, an intestinal brush border enzyme. \\nAfter activation, trypsin cleaves other proteolytic proenzymes \\ninto their active states. Protease inhibitors found in pancreatic \\njuice inhibit early activation of trypsin; the presence of self-\\ndigestion sites on the trypsin molecule allows for feedback \\ninactivation. Pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes are \\nactivated inside the pancreas, causing injury. Triggers for acute \\npancreatitis differ between adults and children. In the adult \\npatient, most episodes are related to alcohol abuse or gallstones. \\nIn children, most cases are idiopathic or due to medications. \\nSome cases are caused by pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis, \\nhypertriglyceridemia, biliary microlithiasis, trauma, or viral \\ninfection.

The causes of \\nchronic pancreatitis include hereditary pancreatitis and milder \\nphenotypes of cystic fibrosis associated with pancreatic suf -\\nficiency. Familial disease is caused by one of several known \\nmutations in the trypsinogen gene. These mutations obliter -\\nate autodigestion sites on the trypsin molecule, inhibiting \\nfeedback inhibition of trypsin digestion. Genetic testing is \\nreadily available for these mutations. Genetic testing for cystic \\nfibrosis can be performed, but must include screening for the \\nless common mutations associated with pancreatic sufficiency. \\nSweat chloride testing is less expensive and is abnormal in \\nmost. Less commonly, mutations in the SPINK1 gene, which \\ncodes for pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and PRSS1, a mutation of \\ncationic trypsinogen, or CTRC, a mutation in chymotrypsin C  \\nare found.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nChildren with chronic pancreatitis initially present with recur-\\nring attacks of acute pancreatitis. Injury to the pancreatic ducts \\npredisposes these children to continued attacks owing to scarring \\nof small and large pancreatic ducts, stasis of pancreatic secre -\\ntions, stone formation, and inflammation. Loss of pancreatic \\nexocrine and endocrine tissue over time can lead to exocrine \\nand endocrine deficiency. More than 90% of the pancreatic \\nmass must be destroyed before exocrine deficiency becomes \\nclinically apparent; this is a late complication that does not \\noccur in all cases. Chronic pain is a serious problem in most \\naffected individuals. These patients have many episodes; many \\ndo not require hospitalization.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nLaboratory diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is similar to acute \\npancreatitis, but with more severe loss of pancreatic tissue, it \\nbecomes less likely that the patient presents with elevation of \\namylase or lipase. Monitoring also should include looking for \\nconsequences of chronic injury, including diabetes mellitus \\nand compromise of the pancreatic and biliary ducts. Pancreatic \\nand biliary imaging has been accomplished by endoscopic \\nretrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP offers \\nthe possibility of therapeutic intervention to remove gall -\\nstones, dilate strictures, and place stents to enhance flow of \\npancreatic juice. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography \\nis an alternative to ERCP . Plain abdominal x-rays may show \\npancreatic calcifications. Diagnostic testing for the etiology \\nof chronic pancreatitis should include genetic testing for \\nhereditary pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis and sweat chloride  \\ndetermination.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is largely supportive. Potential but unproven therapies \\ninclude the use of daily pancreatic enzyme supplements, \\noctreotide (somatostatin) to abort early attacks, low-fat diets, \\nand daily antioxidant therapy. Care must be taken that extreme \\ndiets do not result in nutritional deprivation. Interventional \\nERCP to dilate large strictures and remove stones and surgical \\npancreatic drainage procedures to decompress dilated pancreatic \\nducts by creating a side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy may \\nhave some value.\\nand tenderness and a palpable mass. With necrosis and fluid \\ncollections, patients experiencing severe pancreatitis are prone \\nto infectious complications, and the clinician must be alert for \\nfever and signs of sepsis.\\nLaboratory and Imaging Studies\\nThe diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on 2 of the fol -\\nlowing 3 criteria: abdominal pain consistent with the disease \\n(severe epigastric pain typically), serum amylase and/or \\nlipase greater than 3 time the upper limit of normal, and/\\nor characteristic findings on imaging. Acute pancreatitis can \\nbe difficult to diagnose. Pancreatic enzymes are released into  \\nthe blood during pancreatic injury. Nonspecific elevations of \\nthe enzymes are common. As acute pancreatitis progresses, the \\namylase level tends to decline faster than lipase, making the \\nlatter a good choice for diagnostic testing late in the course of  \\nthe disease.\\nBecause enzyme levels are not 100% sensitive or specific, \\nimaging studies are important for the diagnosis of pancreatitis. \\nIn acute pancreatitis, edema is present in all but the mildest \\ncases. Ultrasound is capable of detecting this edema and should \\nbe performed as part of the overall diagnostic approach. If \\noverlying bowel gas obscures the pancreas, a computed \\ntomography (CT) scan allows complete visualization of the \\ngland. CT scans should be done with oral and intravenous \\n(IV) contrast agents to facilitate interpretation. Ultrasound \\nand CT also can be used to monitor for the development \\nof pseudocysts and for evidence of ductal dilation second -\\nary to obstruction. The other important reason to perform \\nimaging studies early in the course of pancreatitis is to rule \\nout gallstones; the liver, gallbladder, and common bile duct all \\nshould be visualized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea -\\ntography may be used to detect anatomical variants causing  \\npancreatitis.\\nTreatment\\nThere are no proven specific therapies for acute pancreatitis. \\nIf a predisposing etiology is found, such as a drug reaction or \\na gallstone obstructing the sphincter of Oddi, this should be \\nspecifically treated. Fluid resuscitation is necessary because of \\nvomiting and third space losses. Pain relief should be provided. \\nOral, nasogastric, or nasojejunal feedings can begin early if \\ntolerated and may improve outcome. If this is not possible, \\nparenteral nutrition is an option. Fewer complications and more \\nrapid recovery occur with enteral feedings compared with \\nparenteral nutrition. Antibiotics should be considered if the \\npatient is febrile, has extensive pancreatic necrosis, or has \\nlaboratory evidence of infection. A broad-spectrum antibiotic, \\nsuch as imipenem, is considered the best choice.\\nCHRONIC PANCREATITIS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nChronic pancreatitis is defined as recurrent or persistent \\nattacks of pancreatitis, which have resulted in irreversible \\nmorphological changes in pancreatic structure. These include \\nscarring of the ducts with irregular areas of narrowing and \\ndilation (beading), fibrosis of parenchyma, and loss of acinar \\nand islet tissue.

The portion that covers \\nthe abdominal wall is derived from the underlying somatic \\nstructures and is innervated by somatic nerves. The portion \\ncovering the viscera is derived from visceral mesoderm and is \\ninnervated by nonmyelinated visceral afferents. Inflammation \\nof the peritoneum, or peritonitis, usually is caused by infection \\nbut may result from exogenous irritants introduced by penetrat-\\ning injuries or surgical procedures, radiation, and endogenous \\nirritants such as meconium. Infectious peritonitis can be an \\nacute complication of intestinal inflammation and perforation, \\nas in appendicitis, or it can occur secondary to contamination \\nof pre-existing ascites associated with renal, cardiac, or hepatic \\ndisease. In this setting, when there is no other intraabdominal \\nsource, it is referred to as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. \\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis is usually due to pneumococcus \\nand less often to Escherichia coli.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nPeritonitis is characterized on examination by marked abdominal \\ntenderness. Rebound tenderness also generally is quite pro-\\nnounced. The patient tends to move very little owing to intense \\nperitoneal irritation and pain. Fever is not always present, and \\nabsence of fever should not be regarded as contradictory to \\nthe diagnosis. Patients who are taking corticosteroids for an \\nunderlying condition, such as nephrotic syndrome, are likely \\nto have little fever and reduced tenderness.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nBlood tests should focus on identifying the nature of the \\ninflammation and its underlying cause. An elevated white blood \\ncell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein \\nsuggest infection. In children older than 5 years, appendicitis \\nis the leading cause. Total serum protein, albumin, and urinalysis \\nshould be ordered to rule out nephrotic syndrome. Liver function \\ntests should be performed to rule out chronic liver disease \\ncausing ascites. The best way to diagnose suspected peritonitis \\nis to sample the peritoneal fluid with a needle or catheter \\n(paracentesis). Peritoneal fluid in spontaneous bacterial peri-\\ntonitis has a high neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/\\nmm3. Other tests that should be run on the peritoneal fluid \\ninclude amylase (to rule out pancreatic ascites), culture, albumin, \\nand lactate dehydrogenase concentration. For culture, a large \\nsample of fluid should be placed into aerobic and anaerobic \\nblood culture bottles immediately on obtaining the sample.\\nAppendicitis may be identified by ultrasound or computed \\ntomography (CT) scan.

Marshall\\nAcute and chronic respiratory diseases are common in pediatrics. \\nChildren with respiratory problems typically present with \\nsymptoms, although abnormal imaging may at times precede \\nphysical findings. The underlying etiology of childhood respira-\\ntory diseases includes the following: genetic abnormalities (e.g., \\ncystic fibrosis); anatomical differences (e.g., laryngomalacia); \\nincomplete maturation (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia); \\niatrogenic effects (e.g., ventilator-associated injury); immunologi-\\ncal disorders (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency); \\ninfectious diseases (e.g., croup or pneumonia); environmental \\nexposures (e.g., pollutants); and extrapulmonary consequences \\n(e.g., congenital heart disease). The optimal functioning of the \\nentire respiratory system allows children not only to survive \\nbut to thrive.\\nCHAPTER 133 \\nRespiratory System Assessment\\nANATOMY OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\\nAir enters the nose and passes over the large surface area of \\nthe nasal turbinates, which warm, humidify, and filter the \\ninspired air. Secretions draining from the paranasal sinuses are \\ncarried to the pharynx by the mucociliary action of the ciliated \\nrespiratory epithelium. Enlarged lymphoid tissue can obstruct \\nairflow through the nasopharynx (adenoids) or the posterior \\npharynx (tonsils).\\nThe epiglottis protects the larynx during swallowing by \\ndeflecting material toward the esophagus. The arytenoid car-\\ntilages, which assist in opening and closing the vocal folds, are \\nless prominent in children than in adults. The opening formed \\nby the vocal folds (the glottis) is V-shaped, with the apex of \\nthe V being anterior. Below the vocal folds, the walls of the \\nsubglottic space converge toward the cricoid portion of the \\ntrachea. In children under 3 years of age, the cricoid ring is  \\nthe narrowest portion of the airway. In older children and adults \\nit is the glottis. C-shaped cartilage, extending approximately \\n320 degrees around the airway circumference, supports the \\ntrachea and mainstem bronchi. The posterior wall of the \\ntrachea is membranous, allowing airway caliber to change \\nduring inspiration and expiration. Beyond the lobar bronchi, \\ncartilaginous support of the airways becomes discontinuous \\nbut persists until the terminal bronchioles. Airway formation \\nand branching is complete at birth, although length and caliber \\ncontinue to increase until final adult height is achieved.\\nThe right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, lower) and \\ncomprises approximately 55% of the total lung volume. The left  \\nlung has two lobes (upper, lower); the inferior division of the \\nleft upper lobe, the lingula, is analogous to the right middle \\nlobe. The lung parenchyma, where gas exchange occurs, is \\ncomprised of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and \\nalveoli. Oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) must traverse \\nalveolar and capillary membranes and the interstitium to \\nmaintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation to meet the \\nmetabolic demands of the body.\\nThe pediatric lung has tremendous capacity for growth. A \\nfull-term infant has approximately 25 million alveoli; an adult \\nnearly 300 million alveoli. The growth of new alveoli occurs \\nduring the first 2 years of life and is complete by 8 years of age. \\nAfter this time, lung volume increases primarily by increase in \\nalveolar dimensions, with new alveoli rarely formed.\\nPULMONARY PHYSIOLOGY\\nPulmonary Mechanics\\nThe major function of the lungs is to exchange O 2 and CO 2 \\nbetween the atmosphere and the blood. The anatomy of the \\nairways, mechanics of the respiratory muscles and rib cage, \\nnature of the alveolar-capillary interface, pulmonary circulation, \\ntissue metabolism, and neuromuscular control of ventilation \\nall influence gas exchange.\\nAir enters the lungs when intrathoracic pressure is less \\nthan atmospheric pressure. Negative intrathoracic pressure \\nis generated by contraction and lowering of the diaphragm \\nduring normal inspiration. The accessory muscles of inspira-\\ntion (external intercostal, scalene, and sternocleidomastoid \\nmuscles) are not used during quiet breathing but are recruited \\nduring exercise or in disease states to raise and enlarge the rib \\ncage. Exhalation is normally passive, but with active exhalation \\nthe abdominal and internal intercostal muscles are recruited.\\nDuring normal breathing at rest, lung volumes are usually \\nin the midrange of inflation (Fig. 133.1). Tidal volume (TV)  \\nis the amount of air inspired with each relaxed  breath. The \\nvolume of gas retained in the lung at the end of a relaxed \\nexhalation is the functional residual capacity (FRC). This gas \\nvolume maintains exchange of O2 between breaths. Total lung \\ncapacity (TLC) is the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of \\nmaximal inhalation and residual volume (RV) is the volume \\nof gas left in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. \\nVital capacity (VC) is the maximal amount of air that can be \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Restrictive lung disease can also \\nresult from respiratory muscle weakness, pleural disease (effu-\\nsion, inflammation, or mass), thoracic stiffness (scoliosis), and \\nabdominal distention.\\nRespiratory Gas Exchange\\nAlveolar ventilation is defined as the exchange of CO2 between \\nthe alveoli and ambient air. Normally, about 30% of each tidal \\nbreath fills the conducting airways (anatomical dead space). \\nBecause the anatomical dead space is relatively constant, \\nincreasing the TV generally increases the efficacy of ventilation. \\nConversely, if TV decreases, then the dead space/TV ratio \\nincreases and alveolar ventilation decreases.\\nGas exchange depends on alveolar ventilation, pulmonary \\ncapillary blood flow, and the diffusion of gases across the \\nalveolar-capillary membrane. Exchange of CO2 is determined \\nby alveolar ventilation, whereas the exchange of O2 is influenced \\nprimarily by the regional matching of ventilation (V) with \\npulmonary blood flow (Q) (V/Q matching). V/Q matching is \\nmaintained, in part, by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction \\n(local constriction of the pulmonary vessels in areas that are \\nunderventilated). There are five causes of hypoxemia (Table \\n133.1). Disorders resulting in V/Q mismatching (such as \\npneumonia and atelectasis) are the most common causes of \\nhypoxemia in children.\\nLung Defense Mechanisms\\nThe lungs are constantly exposed to particles and infectious \\nagents. The nose is the primary filter for large particles. Particles \\nless than 10 µm in diameter may reach the trachea and bronchi \\nand deposit on the mucosa. Particles less than 1 µm may reach \\nthe alveoli. Ciliated epithelium lining the airways from the \\nlarynx to the bronchioles continuously propels a thin layer of \\nmucus toward the mouth. Alveolar macrophages and poly-\\nmorphonuclear cells engulf particles and pathogens that have \\nbeen opsonized by locally secreted immunoglobulin (Ig)A \\nantibodies or transudated serum antibodies.\\nforcibly expelled from the lungs and is the difference between \\nTLC and RV .\\nAirway resistance is influenced by the diameter and length \\nof the conducting airways, the viscosity of gas, and the nature \\nof the airflow. During quiet breathing, airflow in the smaller \\nairways is laminar (streamlined). At higher flow rates, turbulent \\nflow increases resistance. Resistance is inversely proportional to \\nthe fourth power of the radius of the airway, so relatively small \\nchanges in airway diameter can result in large changes in airway \\nresistance. Excessive airway secretions, bronchospasm, mucosal \\nedema, stenosis, foreign bodies, loss of airway wall integrity \\n(bronchiectasis), and airway compression may all produce \\nsymptomatic increases in airway resistance. Diseases that impact \\nairway resistance, particularly lower airway resistance, fall into \\nthe category of obstructive airways disease .\\nLung compliance (change in volume for a given change in \\npressure) is a measure of the ease with which the lung can be \\ninflated. Processes that decrease lung compliance (surfactant \\ndeficiency, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema) may lead \\nInspiratory\\nReserve\\nVolume\\nTidal\\nVolume\\nExpiratory\\nReserve\\nVolume Functional\\nResidual\\nCapacity\\nVital\\nCapacity Total\\nLung\\nCapacity\\nResidual\\nVolume\\nFIGURE 133.1 Lung volumes and capacities.

It is optimal to observe the respiratory \\npattern, rate, and work of breathing while the child is quiet, \\nnoting the shape and symmetry of the chest wall and the \\nanteroposterior (AP) diameter.\\nAny factor that impairs respiratory mechanics is likely to \\nincrease the respiratory rate. However, nonrespiratory causes \\nof tachypnea include fever, pain, and anxiety. Respiratory rates \\nvary with age (Table 133.2).\\nIt is important to observe the respiratory pattern and degree \\nof effort (work of breathing). Abnormal respiratory patterns \\nare detailed in Table 133.3. Increased work of breathing can \\nbe described as inspiratory ( intercostal, supraclavicular, or \\nsubsternal retractions, nasal flaring) or expiratory (use of \\nabdominal muscles to actively exhale). Causes of increased work \\nCough is a critically important mechanism for protecting \\nthe lungs from infection. It may be voluntary or generated by \\nreflex irritation of the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx, trachea, \\nbronchi, or bronchioles. Cough is a rapid, forceful expiration \\nintended to clear the airways of debris and secretions. Effective \\ncough requires the ability to (1) inhale to near TLC, (2) close and \\nopen the glottis, and (3) contract abdominal muscles to forcibly \\nexhale. Loss of the ability to cough, as with neuromuscular \\nweakness, results in poor secretion clearance and predisposes \\nto atelectasis and pneumonia. Persistent cough suggests chronic \\nirritation at any of these sites due to infectious (e.g., chronic \\nbronchitis), allergic (e.g., postnasal drip, asthma), or chemical \\n(e.g., inhalation or aspiration) triggers.\\nHISTORY\\nCommon respiratory complaints in children include cough, \\nlabored or noisy breathing, chest pain, and exercise intolerance. \\nThe complete respiratory history includes onset, duration, and \\nfrequency of symptoms. It is important to obtain information \\nconcerning severity (hospitalizations, missed school days) and \\npattern (acute, chronic, or intermittent), including factors leading \\nto worsening or improvement. Exposure to others with respira-\\ntory illness and environmental factors (such as pet dander, \\ntobacco smoke, or chemical fumes) should be reviewed. For \\ninfants, a feeding history should be obtained, including ques-\\ntions of coughing or choking with eating or drinking.

In addition to determining lung abnormalities, \\nthey provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral \\nabnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), \\nand the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib \\nnotching). Chest radiographs should be obtained in both the \\nposteroanterior (PA) and lateral projections and, if possible, \\nfollowing a full inspiration. Estimation of lung hyperinflation \\nbased on a single PA view is unreliable; flattened diaphragms \\nand an increased AP diameter on lateral projection are a better \\nindicator of hyperinflation. Increased density on chest radio-\\ngraph can usually be classified as blood, water, pus , or tissue , \\nwith clinical features (e.g., fever or known cardiac disease) \\nnecessary to reach final conclusions. Expiratory and decubitus \\nviews may be useful to detect partial bronchial obstruction \\ndue to an aspirated foreign body, because the affected lung or \\nof breathing during inspiration include extrathoracic airway \\nobstruction (laryngomalacia, croup, subglottic stenosis) and/or \\ndecreased pulmonary compliance (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary \\nedema). Increased expiratory work of breathing usually indicates \\nintrathoracic airway narrowing (e.g., asthma, tracheomalacia). \\nGrunting (forced expiration against a partially closed glottis) is \\noften seen in small children with respiratory distress but may \\nalso be a manifestation of pain.\\nWhen attempting to determine the cause of a respiratory \\ncomplaint, it is useful to auscultate over all potential sites of \\npathology, including the nose and mouth, neck, large airways \\n(central chest and back), and all lobes of both lungs (anterior \\nand posterior, upper and lower, as well as lateral chest wall).\\nStridor is a harsh, monophonic sound caused by a partially \\nobstructed large airway, more commonly heard on inspiration \\nand localized to the neck. Wheezing is produced by partial \\nobstruction of the smaller lower airways, more commonly \\nheard during exhalation and localized to the chest. Wheezes \\ncan be monophonic and low-pitched (usually from large, central \\nairways) or high-pitched and musical (from small peripheral \\nairways). Secretions in the intrathoracic airways may produce \\nwheezing but more commonly result in irregular sounds called \\nrhonchi. Fluid or secretions in small airways may produce \\nsounds characteristic of crumpling cellophane (crackles or \\nrales). Having the child take a deep breath and exhale force -\\nfully will accentuate many abnormal lung sounds. Decreased, \\nabsent, or asymmetric breath sounds may be due to atelectasis, \\nlobar consolidation (pneumonia), thoracic mass, or a pleural \\neffusion. Observation of respiratory rate, work of breathing, \\ntracheal and cardiac deviation, and chest wall motion, combined \\nwith percussion and auscultation, help to identify intrathoracic \\ndisease (Table 133.4).\\nDigital clubbing (Fig. 133.2) is seen in cystic fibrosis and \\nin other, less common chronic pulmonary diseases (such as \\ninterstitial lung disease). It is not associated with asthma, so its \\npresence should heighten concern for other diagnoses. Clubbing \\nmay also be present in nonpulmonary chronic diseases (cardiac, \\ngastrointestinal, or hematological) or, rarely, as a familial trait.\\nTABLE 133.4 Physical Signs of Pulmonary Disease\\nDISEASE \\nPROCESS\\nMEDIASTINAL \\nDEVIATION\\nCHEST \\nMOTION\\nVOCAL \\nFREMITUSPERCUSSION\\nBREATH \\nSOUNDS\\nADVENTITIOUS \\nSOUNDSVOICE SIGNS\\nConsolidation No Reduced over \\narea\\nIncreased Dull Bronchial \\nor reduced\\nNone or \\ncrackles\\nEgophony* \\nPectoriloquy†\\nBronchospasm No Hyperexpansion \\nwith limited \\nmotion\\nNormal or \\ndecreased\\nHyperresonant Normal to \\ndecreased\\nWheezes, \\ncrackles\\nNormal to \\ndecreased\\nAtelectasis Shift toward \\naffected side\\nReduced over \\narea\\nDecreased Dull Reduced None or \\ncrackles\\nNone\\nPneumothorax With tension: \\nshift to the \\nopposite side\\nReduced over \\nPMI\\nNone Resonant None None None\\nPleural \\neffusion\\nIf large: shift to \\nopposite side\\nReduced over \\narea\\nNone or \\nreduced\\nDull None Egophony\\nFriction rub\\nMuffled\\nInterstitial \\nprocess\\nNo Reduced Normal to \\nincreased\\nNormal Normal Inspiratory \\ncrackles\\nNone\\n*In egophony, e sounds like a (may be a sign of consolidation but also is associated with moderate-sized pleural effusions).\\n†In pectoriloquy, words/voice sounds clearer over the affected site (associated with consolidation and cavitary lesions).\\nPMI, Point of maximum impulse.\\nModified from Andreoli TE, Bennett JC, Carpenter CJ, et  al., eds.

Most children \\nabove 6 years of age can perform spirometry. The patient inhales \\nto TLC and then forcibly exhales until no more air can be \\nexpelled. During the forced expiratory maneuver, forced vital \\ncapacity (FVC), forced expired volume in the first second \\n(FEV1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF) rates are measured. \\nThese are compared to predicted values based on patient age, \\ngender, and race, but rely mostly on height. Severity of disease \\nis quantified by calculated percentage of predicted values. The \\npeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be obtained with a simple \\nhand-held device and may be useful for home monitoring of \\nolder children with asthma; however, it is highly dependent on \\npatient effort, and values must be interpreted with caution. \\nMeasurement of TLC, FRC, and RV require body plethys-\\nmography. Helium dilution can also measure TLC and RV by \\ndetermining the magnitude of dilution of inhaled helium in \\nthe air within the lung, but may underestimate air trapping.\\nAbnormal results on pulmonary function testing can be used \\nto categorize obstructive (low flow rates and/or increased RV) \\nor a restrictive lung disease (low FVC and TLC, with relative \\npreservation of flow rates). When the FEV 1 is decreased to a \\ngreater extent than the FVC (FEV1/FVC ratio <80%), obstruc-\\ntive lung disease is diagnosed. The mean midexpiratory flow \\nrate (FEF25-75%) is a more sensitive measure of small airways \\ndisease than the FEV1, but is also more variable. Spirometry can \\ndetect reversible airway obstruction characteristics of asthma \\nwhen a significant improvement in FEV1 (>12%) or in FEF25-75% \\n(>25%) following inhalation of a bronchodilator is measured. \\nInhalation challenge tests using methacholine, histamine, \\nor cold, dry air are used to assess airway hyperreactivity but \\nrequire sophisticated equipment and special expertise and should \\nonly be performed in a pulmonary function laboratory with \\nexperienced technicians.\\nEndoscopic Evaluation of the Airways\\nEndoscopic evaluation of the upper airways (nasopharyngos-\\ncopy) is performed with a flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope \\nto assess adenoid size, patency of the nasal passages, and \\nabnormalities of the glottis. It is especially useful in evaluating \\nstridor and assessing vocal cord motion/function and does not \\nrequire sedation. Endoscopic evaluation of the subglottic space \\nand intrathoracic airways can be done with either a flexible or \\nrigid bronchoscope under anesthesia. Flexible bronchoscopy \\nis useful in identifying dynamic or static airway abnormalities \\n(stenosis, malacia, endobronchial lesions, excessive secretions) \\nand to obtain airway samples for culture (bronchoalveolar \\nlavage). Rigid bronchoscopy is the method of choice for \\nremoving foreign bodies from the airways and performing other \\ninterventions, such as airway dilation. Transbronchial biopsies \\nare rarely performed in children.\\nExamination of Sputum\\nSputum specimens may be useful in evaluating lower respiratory \\ntract infections but are difficult to obtain in children. Specimens \\nlobe does not deflate on exhalation. Decubitus films can also \\nhelp to differentiate pleural effusion from alveolar infiltrate.\\nA barium esophagram may be valuable in diagnosing \\ndisorders of swallowing (dysphagia) and esophageal motility, \\nvascular rings (esophageal compression), tracheoesophageal \\nfistulas, and, to a lesser extent, gastroesophageal reflux. When \\nevaluating for a tracheoesophageal fistula, contrast material \\nmust be instilled under pressure via a catheter with the distal \\ntip situated in the esophagus (see Chapter 128).\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest  is the imaging \\ntool of choice for evaluating masses, interstitial lung disease, \\nand bronchiectasis, as well as delineating pleural from paren-\\nchymal lesions. CT scans with intravenous contrast provide \\nexcellent information about the pulmonary vasculature and \\ngreat vessels, are useful for characterizing congenital pulmonary \\nmalformations, and can detect pulmonary embolism. The speed \\nof current CT scanners makes it possible to scan most children \\nwithout sedating them; however, sedation may be required in \\ninfants and toddlers to decrease motion artifact. Magnetic \\nresonance imaging (MRI) , useful in visualizing cardiac and \\ngreat vessel anatomy and mediastinal lesions, is less useful for \\nevaluation of pulmonary parenchymal lesions. Ultrasonography \\ncan be used to delineate some intrathoracic masses and is the \\nimaging procedure of choice for assessing size and character of \\nparapneumonic effusion/empyema. It is also useful for assessing \\ndiaphragmatic motion in small children.\\nMeasures of Respiratory Gas Exchange\\nA properly performed arterial blood gas analysis provides \\ninformation about the effectiveness of both oxygenation and \\nventilation. As arterial samples are difficult to obtain, capillary \\nand venous blood samples are more commonly used. Capillary \\nor venous samples should not be used to assess oxygenation. \\nThe partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) from a capillary \\nsample is similar to that from arterial blood. The PCO2 in venous \\nsamples is approximately 6 mm H g higher than arterial P CO2.\\nThere are both respiratory and metabolic causes of acidosis \\n(see Chapter 37). In the presence of an alkalosis or acidosis, \\nrespiratory compensation (altering PCO2 to maintain a normal \\npH) can occur within minutes, but renal compensation (altering \\nthe serum bicarbonate level) may not be complete for several \\ndays. Since both the respiratory and metabolic compensation \\nare incomplete, pH will remain on the side of the primary \\ninsult (whether acidosis or alkalosis).\\nPulse oximetry measures the O2 saturation of hemoglobin \\nby measuring the blood absorption of two or more wavelengths \\nof light. It is noninvasive, easy to use, and reliable. Because \\nof the shape of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, O2 \\nsaturation does not decrease much until the partial pressure of \\noxygen (PO2) reaches approximately 60 mm H g. Pulse oximetry \\nmay not accurately reflect true O 2 saturation when abnormal \\nhemoglobin is present (carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin), \\nwhen perfusion is poor, or if no light passes through to the \\nphotodetector (nail polish).\\nThe measurement of PCO2 is accomplished most reliably by \\nblood gas analysis. However, there are noninvasive monitors that \\nrecord exhaled PCO2 (end-tidal CO2), which is representative of \\nalveolar PCO2. End-tidal PCO2 measurements are most commonly \\nused in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients, but \\nsome devices can measure PCO2 at the nares. Transcutaneous \\nelectrodes can be used to monitor PCO2 at the skin surface, but \\nare less accurate. Noninvasive techniques of CO2 measurement \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Humidified high flow \\nnasal cannula (HFNC) allows the provider to deliver greater \\nflow rates of blended gas at a specific FiO2. Though its use began \\nin neonates as an alternative to continuous positive airway \\npressure (CPAP), it is now commonly used across the pediatric \\nage spectrum. Depending on the size of the patient, the type of \\ncannulae and device used, HFNC can deliver modest positive \\npressure, relieve dyspnea, and purge CO2 from anatomical dead \\nspace to improve alveolar ventilation in addition to providing \\noxygenation. There are very limited options for provision of \\nHFNC outside the hospital at this time. Supplemental O2 may \\nalso be delivered by a variety of mask systems including a \\nsimple mask (delivers O2 in L/min), a Venturi mask (blends \\nto a specific FiO2), and a non-rebreather mask with reservoir \\nthat can provide nearly 100% O 2.\\nAerosol Therapy\\nTherapeutic agents such as bronchodilators, corticosteroids, \\nand antibiotics can be delivered to the lower respiratory tract \\nby dry powder inhaler  (DPI), metered-dose inhaler (MDI), \\nor nebulizer. All of these devices are designed to generate \\nsmall particles that can bypass the filtering action of the upper \\nairway and deposit in the lower airways. Many factors influence \\ndrug deposition including patient technique, device used, age \\nof the child, and breathing pattern. Nebulizers should be used \\nwith a face mask (infants) or mouthpiece (children and teens) \\nto minimize loss of drug to ambient air. Plastic holding chambers \\n(spacers) are available for all ages and should always be used \\nwith MDIs. DPIs require a single rapid, deep inhalation for \\noptimal drug delivery, which is difficult for children under 6 \\nyears of age. MDIs and nebulizers are equally effective in \\ndelivering medications only if the technique is correct, so it is \\nimportant to review this frequently and carefully with families \\n(Fig 133.3).\\ncontaining large numbers of squamous epithelial cells or heavily \\ncontaminated with upper airway secretions may yield misleading \\nresults. Sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract bacterial \\ninfections often contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes and \\none predominant organism on culture. If sputum cannot be \\nobtained, then bronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary for \\nmicrobiologic diagnosis in selected situations. In patients with \\nCF who are unable to expectorate sputum, specially processed \\nthroat cultures are used as surrogates for lower airway \\ncultures.\\nLung Biopsy\\nWhen less invasive methods fail to provide diagnoses in \\npatients with pulmonary disease, a lung biopsy may be required. \\nConcern for childhood interstitial lung disease, atypical \\ninfection (especially in an immunocompromised host), and \\nevaluation of a mass/malformation are the most common \\nindications for biopsy. CT-guided needle biopsy performed \\nby an interventional radiologist is an option if limited histology \\nis needed and the lesion is amenable to percutaneous approach \\n(e.g., fungal nodules). Either a thoracoscopic procedure or a \\nthoracotomy is preferred if thorough histological evaluation is  \\ndesired.\\nTHERAPEUTIC MEASURES\\nOxygen Administration\\nAny child in respiratory distress should be treated with supple-\\nmental oxygen at concentration sufficient to maintain acceptable \\nO2 saturation levels. Normal O2 saturation is greater than 95%; \\nhowever, lower saturations may be appropriate in certain clinical \\nscenarios, such as preterm birth or congenital heart disease. It \\nis not necessary to achieve 100% saturation. Patients requiring \\nsupplemental O2 should be monitored with pulse oximetry, \\nintermittently or continuously, or with arterial blood gas \\nmeasurements of PO2 to allow titration to the lowest required \\nO2 concentration. The actual fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \\ndelivered to the patient can be quite variable and is affected by \\nA B\\nFIGURE 133.3 Inhaled drug delivery in children.

Because the tracheostomy tube hampers the ability \\nto phonate and may become occluded with secretions, leading \\nto life-threatening airway obstruction, the child must be \\nmonitored carefully at all times.\\nMechanical Ventilation\\nPatients who are unable to maintain adequate gas exchange \\nmay require mechanical ventilation. Most modes of mechanical \\nventilation involve inflation of the lungs with gas using positive \\npressure. The inspiratory phase is active (air is pushed in), and \\nexhalation is passive.\\nMechanical ventilation often requires an artificial airway, \\nalthough it can be provided noninvasively via tight-fitting nasal \\nor full face masks. Noninvasive ventilation is particularly useful \\nin patients with obstructive sleep apnea and neuromuscular \\ndisease who require support only part of the day or night, but \\nit can also be used to assist ventilation continuously for patients \\nin acute respiratory failure from a variety of causes.\\nNo method of mechanical ventilation truly simulates natural \\nbreathing. All methods have their drawbacks and complica-\\ntions. Positive pressure is transmitted to the entire thorax and \\nmay impede venous return to the heart. The airways and lung \\nparenchyma may be damaged by inflation pressures and high \\nconcentrations of inspired O2. In general, inflation pressures \\nshould be limited to those necessary to provide sufficient \\nlung expansion for adequate ventilation and the prevention \\nof atelectasis. Pressure-cycled and volume-cycled ventilators \\n(conventional ventilation) are the most widely used modalities \\nin pediatrics. High-frequency jet ventilation and high-frequency \\noscillatory ventilation are used often in neonatology and may \\nbe used in patients with severe lung disease who are failing \\nconventional mechanical ventilation.\\nCHAPTER 134 \\nControl of Breathing\\nVentilation is controlled primarily by central chemoreceptors \\nlocated in the medulla that respond to intracellular pH and \\nPCO2 levels (Fig. 134.1). To a lesser extent, ventilation is modu-\\nlated by peripheral receptors located in the carotid and aortic \\nbodies which respond predominantly to P O2. The central \\nreceptors are quite sensitive. Small acute changes in Pa CO2 \\nnormally result in significant changes in minute ventilation. \\nThe ventilatory drive is not increased when the PCO2 is chroni-\\ncally elevated, as the intracellular pH returns to normal levels \\nfollowing compensatory increases in the bicarbonate level. The \\nperipheral receptors do not stimulate ventilation until the PaO2 \\ndecreases to approximately 60 m m Hg. These receptors become \\nimportant in patients with chronic Pa CO2 elevation who may \\nhave a blunted ventilatory response to CO 2.\\nThe output of the central respiratory center also is modulated \\nby reflex mechanisms. Full lung inflation temporarily inhibits \\ninspiratory effort in infants (Hering-Breuer reflex) through vagal \\nafferent fibers. Other reflexes from the airways and intercostal \\nmuscles may influence the depth and frequency of respiratory \\nefforts (see Fig. 134.1).\\nChest Physiotherapy and Clearance Techniques\\nWhen disease processes impair normal ciliary and cough \\nfunction, airway clearance therapy may help maintain airway \\npatency and secretion mobilization. Most methods work by \\nmoving secretions toward the central airways, from which they \\ncan be expectorated. Chest percussion or pneumatic vests are \\noften used in young or neurologically impaired children; whereas \\nolder children can operate hand-held devices that generate \\nexpiratory back-pressure and vibration (TheraPEP , Flutter, \\nAcapella, and Aerobika). Pneumatic (therapy) vests may also \\nbe used in older children and adolescents, especially those with \\ncystic fibrosis. Children who are too weak to generate an effective \\ncough benefit from the use of a mechanical insufflation-\\nexsufflation device (CoughAssist), used in conjunction with \\nchest physiotherapy. Chest physiotherapy is generally not \\nbeneficial for patients with asthma or pneumonia, and its \\neffectiveness in patients with atelectasis has not been clearly \\nestablished.\\nIntubation\\nIf the upper airway is obstructed or mechanical ventilation is \\nneeded, it may be necessary to provide the patient with an \\nartificial airway. This is best done by placing an endotracheal \\ntube via the mouth or nose into the trachea (intubation). \\nEndotracheal tubes can damage the larynx and the airways if \\nthe tubes are of improper size and are not carefully maintained. \\nThe cricoid ring is the narrowest segment of a child’s airway \\nand is completely surrounded by cartilage, which makes it \\nvulnerable to damage and subglottic stenosis. If the pressure \\ncreated by the tube against the airway mucosa exceeds capillary \\nfilling pressure (roughly 35 c m H2O), mucosal ischemia develops, \\nleading to necrosis. Therefore a small air leak should always \\nbe maintained around the endotracheal tube to minimize the \\nrisk of mucosal damage. No clear guidelines are available \\nregarding how long pediatric patients can be intubated without \\nsustaining airway damage or when conversion to tracheostomy \\nis indicated.\\nIntubation alters the physiology of the respiratory tract \\nin many ways, not all of which are beneficial. It interferes \\nwith the humidification, warming, and filtration of inspired \\nair and stimulates secretion production. Providing adequate \\nhumidification of inspired air and appropriate suctioning of \\nthe tube reduce the probability of occlusion by secretions. In \\naddition to endotracheal tubes, the laryngeal mask airway \\n(LMA) can be used to provide mechanical ventilation. This \\ndevice consists of a tube with a soft mask at the distal end \\nthat is placed over the larynx, creating a seal without the \\ntrachea being instrumented. Although less invasive, the \\nLMA is less secure, so it is generally limited to procedural  \\nanesthesia.\\nTracheostomy\\nTracheostomy is the surgical placement of an artificial airway \\ninto the trachea below the larynx. Congenital or acquired upper \\nairway obstruction (see Chapter 135) is the most common \\nindication for tracheostomy in children. In addition, if prolonged \\nmechanical ventilation is required, elective tracheostomy can \\nbe performed to increase patient comfort and facilitate nursing \\ncare. Many children with tracheostomy tubes can be cared for \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

PSG, home oximetry, and \\nhome cardiorespiratory monitoring are not helpful in predicting \\nrisk or preventing sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) so \\nshould not be recommended for this purpose.\\nSUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nSIDS is defined as the unexpected death of an infant younger \\nthan 1 year of age in which the cause remains unexplained after \\nautopsy, death scene investigation, and review of clinical history. \\nThe risk of SIDS is higher in male, premature, and low birth \\nweight infants; infants born to impoverished mothers; and \\nmothers who smoke cigarettes or have abused drugs. The risk \\nof SIDS is increased threefold to fivefold in siblings of infants \\nwho have died of SIDS and is highest during the winter. SIDS \\nis rare before 4 weeks or after 6 months of age and is most \\ncommon between 2 and 4 months. The incidence of SIDS has \\ndecreased dramatically since the 1980s.\\nA variety of unproven mechanisms have been proposed to \\nexplain SIDS. Current theories for a predisposition to SIDS \\ninclude cellular brainstem abnormalities and maturational delay \\nrelated to neural or cardiorespiratory control. Prone (chest down) \\nposition during sleep and exposure to maternal smoking both \\nalter heart rate variability and arousal response, which may \\ncontribute to the risk of SIDS. A portion of SIDS deaths may be \\ndue to prolongation of the Q-T interval, abnormal CNS control \\nof respiration, and CO2 rebreathing from sleeping face down \\n(especially in soft bedding). Importantly, there is no association \\nbetween BRUE/ALTE and SIDS.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nSee Table 134.2 for the differential diagnosis of SIDS.\\nPrevention\\nSIDS is associated with prone position during sleep, especially \\non soft bedding, excess insulation, and bed sharing. There has \\nbeen a significant decline in SIDS with the back-to-sleep \\nprogram and avoiding soft bedding. Thus all parents should \\nbe instructed to place their infants in the supine position (on \\ntheir backs/chest up) unless there are medical contraindications. \\nAll loose, soft bedding should be excluded from sleep space, \\nand parents who share beds with their infants should be \\nchildren who have OSA snore. Thus when the diagnosis is in \\nquestion, it should be confirmed with a polysomnogram (PSG).\\nPSG is the only definitive test for evaluation of obstructive \\nand central sleep apnea. It involves continuous recording of \\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram for sleep \\nstaging, oronasal airflow and pressure, audible snore, chest \\nand abdominal wall excursion, leg and chin electromyogram, \\nelectrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and capnography. The \\nmeasured score from a PSG is the apnea-hypopnea index \\n(AHI) or number of times in an hour of sleep that the child \\nhas cessation or reduction of airflow of a significant magnitude \\nto negatively affect oxygenation or sleep stage. An AHI less \\nthan 1 is the generally accepted norm for pediatric patients \\nalthough the decision to treat often hinges on the severity of \\ndaytime impairment. Measured AHI is typically worse in rapid \\neye movement (REM) sleep and when the child is supine, so \\nan ideal study captures all sleep stages and positions.\\nAdenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common cause of \\nOSA in young children, with peak age 2-5 years. Other risk \\nfactors for OSA include obesity, premature birth, craniofacial \\nmalformations, trisomy 21, and neuromuscular diseases. Treat-\\nment of OSA starts with determining whether the child will \\nbenefit from adenoidectomy, with or without tonsillectomy. If \\nsurgical intervention is not indicated or fails to alleviate the \\nproblem, then the use of continuous positive airway pressure \\n(CP AP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiP AP) via nasal \\ninterfaces can be used to distend the upper airway during \\nsleep. This requires a tight-fitting nasal mask, which may not \\nbe well tolerated in young children. Supplemental oxygen can \\nblunt hypoxemia in milder cases of OSA but does not alter \\nobstruction and sleep fragmentation. In extreme cases, especially \\nthose associated with craniofacial abnormalities or hypotonia, \\ntracheostomy may be indicated.\\nBRIEF RESOLVED UNEXPLAINED EVENTS\\nA brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)  is defined as a \\n<1 minute, self-limited episode with one or more of the following \\nfeatures: (1) cyanosis or pallor, (2) absent or irregular breathing, \\n(3) change in tone, or (4) altered level of responsiveness in an \\ninfant <1 year of age. Importantly, BRUE differs from the \\npreviously used diagnostic term apparent life-threatening event \\n(ALTE) in that it includes only episodes with cyanosis (not \\nrubor) and/or altered responsiveness and does not include \\ncaregiver perception of the event as “life-threatening. ” The label \\nBRUE should be used only when no other explanation for the \\nevent is identified on detailed history and physical examination. \\nHistorical data suggests that a cause could be identified in \\n>50% of ALTE events, thus the new category of BRUE is quite \\nsmall. History and exam should focus on the most common \\nidentifiable causes of abnormal breathing episodes in infancy \\nincluding gastroesophageal reflux, CNS pathology (seizures, \\nintracranial bleeding from accidental or nonaccidental trauma), \\nand infection (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], pertussis, and \\nserious bacterial infections). Cardiovascular events (arrhythmia) \\nand metabolic derangements are among diagnoses that may \\nnot be recognized on initial history and examination; however, \\nthese are quite uncommon.\\nInfants >2 months of age and born at >32 weeks gestation \\nwho experience a single, <1 minute, self-limited (no cardiopul-\\nmonary resuscitation [CPR] required) BRUE are considered at \\nlow risk for undiagnosed serious condition or repeat event.

The stridor is typically loudest \\nwhen the infant is feeding or active and decreases when the \\ninfant is relaxed or placed prone, or when the neck is flexed. \\nAny condition that increases upper airway inflammation will \\nexacerbate laryngomalacia, including viral respiratory infections, \\ndysphagia (swallowing dysfunction), and gastroesophageal \\nreflux. Laryngomalacia normally peaks by 3-5 months of age \\nand resolves between 6 and 12 months of age. However, \\noccasionally it can persist in otherwise normal children up \\nuntil 24 months of age, and even longer in children with \\nunderlying conditions, especially those with neurological \\ndiseases affecting control of upper airway muscles (such as \\ncerebral palsy).\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nIn many infants with presumed laryngomalacia, the diagnosis \\ncan be tentatively established by history and physical examina-\\ntion. If the patient follows the typical course for laryngomalacia, \\nthen no further work-up is necessary. However, to firmly \\nestablish the diagnosis, which is important in more severe or \\natypical cases, the patient should undergo flexible nasopha-\\nryngoscopy to assess the patency and dynamic movement \\n(collapse) of the larynx and surrounding structures. This \\nprocedure can also identify vocal cord abnormalities and airway \\nlesions above the vocal cords.\\nTreatment\\nIn most cases, no therapy is required for laryngomalacia. The \\ninfant should be observed closely during times of respiratory \\ninfection for evidence of respiratory compromise. Infants with \\nsevere laryngomalacia resulting in hypoventilation, hypoxia, \\nor growth failure may benefit from a surgical procedure \\n(aryepiglottoplasty) or, in extreme cases, a tracheostomy to \\nbypass the upper airway.\\nSubglottic Stenosis\\npresence of adenoid tissue or vocal cord and other airway lesions, \\nand laryngomalacia.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nChoanal Stenosis (Atresia)\\nChoanal stenosis/atresia is a congenital problem presenting in \\nthe neonatal period. It may be bilateral or unilateral and is \\nrelatively rare. Neonates are generally obligate nose breathers, \\nso obstruction of nasal passages can cause significant respiratory \\ndistress, especially when feeding. Crying bypasses the obstruc-\\ntion because crying infants breathe through their mouths. \\nInability to easily pass a small catheter through the nostrils \\nshould raise the suspicion of choanal atresia.

It is the most common cause of stridor \\nin infants. It may be due to decreased muscular tone of the \\nlarynx and surrounding structures or to immature carti-\\nlaginous structures. It usually does not result in significant \\nrespiratory distress, but occasionally it is severe enough \\nto cause apnea, hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and difficulty  \\nfeeding.\\nEtiology\\nSubglottic stenosis is the narrowing of the portion of the trachea \\nimmediately below the vocal cords. It may be congenital but \\nmore often is acquired. Endotracheal intubation, especially \\nprolonged or repeated intubation required in some premature \\ninfants, can lead to inflammation and scarring of the subglottic \\nspace.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nSubglottic stenosis can present as stridor that is biphasic (on \\nboth inspiration and expiration) but usually more prominent \\non inspiration. With increasing respiratory effort, the stridor \\nbecomes louder. Very small infants may not be able to breathe \\nwith enough force to generate a sound.

Adenoidal and tonsillar \\nhyperplasia may be aggravated by recurrent infection, allergy, \\nand inhaled irritants.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe signs of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy are mouth \\nbreathing, snoring, and, in some patients, obstructive sleep \\napnea (see Chapter 134). The eustachian tubes enter the \\nnasopharynx at the choanae and can be obstructed by enlarged \\nadenoids, predisposing to recurrent or persistent otitis media.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nAdenoidal hypertrophy is assessed by a lateral radiograph of \\nthe nasopharynx or by flexible nasopharyngoscopy.\\nTreatment\\nIf the adenoids or tonsils are large and thought to be significantly \\ncontributing to UAO, then the most effective treatment is \\nremoval.

Other \\nsurgical options include tracheoplasty and cricoid split proce-\\ndures. A tracheostomy tube may be required to bypass the \\nsubglottic space until the airway is patent enough to allow \\nadequate airflow.\\nMass Lesions\\nUpper airway mass lesions are relatively uncommon. The most \\ncommon laryngeal tumor in childhood is the hemangioma, \\nwhich usually presents before 6 months of age and is often able \\nto be treated medically (see Chapter 194). Definitive diagnosis \\nrequires endoscopy. If the obstruction is severe, a tracheostomy \\ntube may be needed until the lesion spontaneously involutes \\nor improves with therapy.\\nLaryngeal webs are the result of failed recanalization of the \\nglottic airway in utero, whereas laryngeal cysts typically occur as \\na consequence of airway trauma (intubation). Both can produce \\nbiphasic stridor and are best identified by bronchoscopy.

Clinical \\nmanifestations usually start in infancy and include biphasic \\nstridor and hoarse voice/cry. The lesions are most commonly \\nlocated in the larynx, but they can spread distally into the \\ntrachea, large bronchi, and even to the lung parenchyma. Treat-\\nment options, which are limited and rarely curative, include \\nlaser therapy and interferon.

In contrast to upper airway obstruction, obstruction \\nbelow the thoracic inlet causes more wheezing on expiration \\nthan on inspiration. Intrathoracic pressure is increased relative \\nto atmospheric pressure during exhalation, which collapses the \\nintrathoracic airways and accentuates airway narrowing on \\nexpiration. Expiratory airflow through obstructed intrathoracic \\nairways leads to wheeze, prolonged expiratory phase, and \\nincreased abdominal work of breathing. In patients with chronic \\nairway infection (e.g., cystic fibrosis), the bronchi become \\npermanently damaged and dilated (bronchiectasis). Patients \\nwith bronchiectasis have episodes of cough, often productive \\nof purulent sputum, and may have inspiratory crackles.\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\\nWhen asthma is suspected, empiric trials of therapy (broncho-\\ndilators, short courses of oral corticosteroids, long-term use of \\ninhaled corticosteroids) are useful in arriving at a diagnosis. \\nIn children older than 6 years, pulmonary function tests \\n(spirometry) can assess airflow obstruction and response to \\nbronchodilators. Radiographic evaluation is not needed with \\neach episode of wheezing, but those with significant respiratory \\ndistress, fever, history consistent with foreign body aspiration, or \\nfocal auscultatory findings should have posteroanterior (PA) and \\nlateral chest radiographs obtained. Generalized hyperinflation, \\nindicated by flattening of the diaphragms and an increased \\nanteroposterior (AP) chest diameter, suggests diffuse obstruc-\\ntion of the small airways. Localized hyperinflation, especially \\non expiratory views, suggests localized bronchial obstruction \\n(foreign body or an anatomical anomaly). Dysphagia leading to \\naspiration and airway inflammation can present with persistent \\nwheezing. This is best assessed with a videofluoroscopic swal-\\nlowing study. Gastroesophageal reflux may aggravate asthma \\nand may lead to wheezing in very young children, especially if \\nit is associated with aspiration. Infants with persistent wheezing \\ndespite empiric treatment with asthma therapy may benefit \\nfrom an airway evaluation with flexible bronchoscopy.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAsthma\\nmost common lower airway disease in children is asthma, \\nwhich results in variable and recurring symptoms, diffuse \\nbronchial obstruction from airway inflammation, and \\nhyperresponsiveness of bronchial smooth muscle leading \\nto airway constriction.

In addition to respiratory symptoms, complete \\nvascular rings may cause dysphagia as a result of esophageal \\ncompression. The diagnosis of vascular anomalies can often \\nbe made by a barium swallow, which identifies the esophageal \\ncompression (Fig 136.1). Bronchoscopy will identify a pulsatile \\ncompression of the airway, but the diagnostic procedures of \\nchoice are a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the \\nchest and great vessels or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA). \\nDefinitive treatment of vascular rings requires surgical repair. \\nOther causes of extrinsic tracheal compression include enlarged \\nmediastinal lymph nodes (tuberculosis), mediastinal masses \\n(teratoma, lymphoma, thymoma, germ cell tumors), and, rarely, \\ncystic hygromas.\\nForeign Body Aspiration\\nEpidemiology\\nAspiration of foreign bodies into the trachea and bronchi is \\nrelatively common.

Because the \\nright mainstem bronchus takes off at a less acute angle than \\nthe left mainstem bronchus, foreign bodies tend to lodge in \\nright-sided airways. Some foreign bodies, especially nuts, can \\nalso lodge more proximally in the larynx or subglottic space, \\nabnormalities can result in excessive collapse of the trachea, \\nmost pronounced during expiration. Tracheomalacia is the \\nmost common congenital tracheal abnormality and may be \\ncongenital (tracheoesophageal fistula or bony dysplasia syn-\\ndromes) or acquired (long-term mechanical ventilation). \\nTracheomalacia must be differentiated from extrinsic tracheal \\ncompression by masses or vascular structures. Localized tra-\\ncheomalacia may persist after the trachea has been relieved of \\nextrinsic compression.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nWith tracheomalacia, the tracheal collapse may only be apparent \\nduring forced exhalation or with cough. It is commonly \\naggravated by respiratory infections. The airway collapse causes \\na harsh, monophonic wheeze compared to the polyphonic \\nwheeze more often seen in asthma. Secretions may be retained \\nbehind the segment of malacia, predisposing to infection. Infants \\nwith severe tracheomalacia may completely collapse their \\ntracheas during agitation, resulting in cyanotic episodes that \\nresemble breath holding spells. The voice is normal, as is \\ninspiratory effort. In older children, the hallmark sign is a brassy, \\nbarky cough due to the vibration of the tracheal walls. The \\nexpiratory noises of tracheomalacia are often mistakenly ascribed \\nto asthma or bronchiolitis, and the barky cough is often mis-\\ndiagnosed as croup.\\nTreatment\\nInfants with mild to moderate tracheomalacia usually require no \\nintervention. Tracheomalacia improves with airway growth as \\nthe lumen increases in diameter and the tracheal wall becomes \\nmore firm. The treatment of older symptomatic children is \\ngeared toward treating the precipitating cause for cough and \\nproviding supportive care. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat \\nconcurrent infection. Children, especially infants, with severe \\ntracheomalacia may require tracheostomy tubes to administer \\ncontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which serves to \\nstent open the airway. Custom-length tracheostomy tubes are \\nused to bypass the site of collapse. Surgical techniques such as \\nslide tracheoplasty may benefit short segments of severe malacia. \\nAortopexy has been used to limit anterior collapse but does \\nnot treat posterior tracheal membrane collapse. Historically, \\nsurgically placed airway stents have been problematic in children \\nbecause airway stents may erode and migrate, do not grow with \\nchildren, and serve as a source of fixed stenosis and obstruction. \\nNewer absorbable airway external splints and internal stents \\nwith 3D-printing technology are under active investigation for \\ntreatment of severe pediatric tracheomalacia.\\nTracheoesophageal Fistula\\nSee Chapter 128.\\nExtrinsic Tracheal Compression\\nCompression of the trachea by vascular structures or masses \\ncan cause significant respiratory compromise. Tracheal compres-\\nsion by aberrant great vessels (aorta, innominate artery) may \\ncause wheezing, stridor, cough, and dyspnea. Incomplete vascular \\nrings are often asymptomatic and incidentally found, but anterior \\ntracheal compression can occur from an anomalous innominate \\nartery that arises more distally than normal from the aortic \\narch. This usually results in mild respiratory symptoms. Surgical \\nFIGURE 136.1 Vascular ring. Indentation of the posterior esophagus \\nseen on barium swallow, lateral view.

However, a proportion of \\npatients have a negative history because the aspiration went \\nunrecognized. Physical findings observed with acute foreign \\nbody aspiration may include cough, localized wheezing, uni-\\nlateral absence of breath sounds, stridor, and, rarely, bloody \\nsputum.\\nMost foreign bodies are small and quickly expelled, but \\nsome may remain in the lung for long periods of time and \\nmay come to medical attention because of persistent cough, \\nsputum production, or recurrent unilateral pneumonia. Foreign \\nbody aspiration should be in the differential diagnosis of \\npatients with persistent wheezing unresponsive to broncho-\\ndilator therapy, persistent atelectasis, recurrent or persistent \\npneumonia, or chronic cough without another explanation. \\nForeign bodies may also lodge in the esophagus and compress \\nthe trachea, thus producing respiratory symptoms. Therefore \\nesophageal foreign bodies should be included in the differ-\\nential diagnosis of infants or young children with persistent \\ncough, stridor, or wheezing, particularly if dysphagia is  \\npresent.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nRadiographic studies will reveal the presence of radiopaque \\nobjects and can also identify focal air trapping, especially on \\nexpiratory views or decubitus films. Many foreign bodies are \\nnot radiopaque. Thus when foreign body aspiration is suspected, \\nexpiratory or lateral decubitus chest radiographs may identify \\nair trapping on the affected, dependent side. If history or exam \\nis suggestive of foreign body aspiration, the patient should \\nundergo rigid bronchoscopy, typically performed by an oto-\\nlaryngologist. Flexible bronchoscopy can be used to locate an \\naspirated foreign body and may be useful when the presentation \\nis not straightforward, but foreign body removal is best per-\\nformed via rigid bronchoscopy.\\nPrevention\\nCommon foods, including peanuts or other nuts, popcorn, \\nuncooked carrots, or any foods difficult to break into small \\npieces, are at risk to be aspirated by infants and children, \\nparticularly before molar teeth have erupted.

Radiographically, it may be \\nmistaken for a pneumothorax. Lobectomy may be required \\nif respiratory distress is severe or progressive, but if the \\npatient is asymptomatic, then surgical resection may not be  \\nindicated.\\nCongenital pulmonary airway malformations (CP AMs) are \\na spectrum of lesions arising during early lung development with \\nhistological appearance ranging from simplified bronchial to \\ncomplex cystic alveolar tissue, connected to the tracheobronchial \\ntree. They are often first identified on antenatal ultrasound, and \\nafter birth can be inconspicuous on chest radiograph. CPAMs \\nare nonfunctioning lung tissue and can have hybrid features \\nof pulmonary sequestration (presence of systemic circulation \\nconnections). Although CPAM lesions can be stand-alone \\nlesions, a substantial proportion of pulmonary sequestrations \\nare hybrid CPAM lesions. Sequestrations without hybrid features \\nare separate from the tracheobronchial tree and are classified \\nas intrapulmonary (located in a normal lobe without its own \\npleura) and extrapulmonary (outside normal lung). CPAMs and \\nsequestrations can coexist with other chest lesions including \\ncongenital diaphragmatic hernia. Sequestration is also associ-\\nated with Scimitar syndrome (partial anomalous pulmonary \\nvenous return). Symptomatic neonates with respiratory distress, \\nlarge lesions, or family history of features concerning for malig-\\nnancy require further imaging. Though large malformations \\ncan cause neonatal respiratory distress, many are asymptomatic. \\nChest CT with contrast is the diagnostic test of choice (Fig \\n136.2) but may be delayed if the child is asymptomatic with \\nclose clinical follow-up for symptom development. Surgical \\nresection is curative, but risk of infection or malignancy is not \\ncompletely understood in these children. Conservative manage-\\nment with observation is a reasonable option for families with  \\nlow risk.\\nPulmonary hypoplasia, or a relative decrease in amount \\nof alveoli, may be the result of a number of congenital \\ninsults, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (see \\nChapter 61) or unilateral congenital absence of a pulmonary \\nartery.

This disorder affects approximately 1 in 15,000-20,000 \\nlive births, although the actual incidence may be higher \\nbecause of a limited ability to definitively diagnose affected  \\npatients.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nClinical manifestations include neonatal respiratory distress, \\nchronic cough, chronic nasal congestion, middle ear effusions, \\nchronic pansinusitis, laterality defects (e.g., situs inversus), \\ninfertility, and bronchiectasis. Kartagener syndrome, the triad \\nof situs inversus, pansinusitis, and bronchiectasis, accounts \\nfor approximately 50% of cases. Males are infertile as a result \\nof immotile sperm. Because the cilia fail to beat normally, \\nsecretions accumulate in the airways, and endobronchial infec-\\ntion results. Chronic infection, if untreated, leads to bronchi -\\nectasis by early adulthood.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nPCD diagnosis has historically relied on a combination of clinical \\nfeatures and ultrastructural analysis of respiratory cilia by \\nelectron microscopy, obtained from scrapings/biopsy of nasal \\nor airway epithelium. Results may be difficult to interpret as \\nchronic infection and inflammation may also lead to ultra-\\nstructural abnormalities in nasal cilia. The most common \\nultrastructural defect is the absence of dynein arms. A third \\nof affected individuals have normal ciliary ultrastructure. The \\nmeasurement of nasal nitric oxide has been used as a screening \\ntool for PCD. Low nasal nitric oxide values (<77 nL/min) are \\nconsistent with PCD. High-speed video microscopy assesses \\nciliary beat frequency and pattern but requires specialized \\nequipment and, currently, there is an absence of standardized \\nreporting methods. PCD is generally autosomal recessive. \\nCurrently 31 genes have been identified to explain approximately \\n60% of cases. The association of genetic defects and clinical \\nphenotype is unknown.\\nFIGURE 136.2  Congenital pulmonary airway malformation.

Pediatric PH is \\ncategorized into five groups based on the World Health Orga-\\nnization classification, similar to adult PH. Group 1 is pulmonary \\narterial hypertension (PAH) due to diseases within veins and \\nsmall pulmonary muscular arteries such as persistent PH of \\nthe newborn, congenital heart disease (including those with \\nexcessive pulmonary blood flow due to left-to-right cardiac \\nshunting), exposure to various drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphet-\\namines), and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension  \\n(IPAH, previously called primary PH). Hereditary IPAH is also \\nin this group and has been linked with the bone morphogenetic \\nreceptor-2 (BMPR2) gene. Group 2 is caused by dysfunction \\nof the left heart such as valvular disease. Group 3 is secondary \\nto lung disease or chronic hypoxia, including upper airway \\nobstruction resulting in obstructive sleep apnea and hypoxemia. \\nIn Group 4, PH is secondary to chronic pulmonary thrombo-\\nembolism. Group 5 includes PH of unclear but multifactorial \\ndiseases, including some autoimmune diseases and metabolic \\ndiseases. The Panama Classification is a new pediatric-specific \\nsystem that includes ten categories to capture the heterogeneity \\nof pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease from the fetus to \\nadolescent (e.g., perinatal pulmonary vascular maladaptation, \\nmultifactorial pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease in \\ncongenital malformation syndromes, diffuse pediatric lung \\ndisease). This classification system is promising, but has yet to \\nbe tested and validated for utility and accuracy.\\nProlonged PH may lead to irreversible changes in the intima \\nand media of the pulmonary arterioles. PH strains the right \\nside of the heart, which leads to hypertrophy and dilation of \\nthe right ventricle. Altered structure and/or function of the \\nright heart from PH is known as cor pulmonale. The most \\ncommon causes of cor pulmonale in children are chronic lung \\ndiseases, especially severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and \\nsevere, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (with chronic hypoxia).\\nClinical Manifestations and Diagnostic Studies\\nPAH should be suspected with developmental anatomical \\nabnormalities or historical exposures (e.g., congenital diaphrag-\\nmatic hernia, prolonged hypoxemia). Exertional dyspnea and \\nunexplained syncope are presenting symptoms. In addition to \\nthe other physical findings associated with pulmonary and \\ncardiac diseases, an accentuated pulmonary component of the \\nsecond heart sound may be heard. Definitive diagnosis is made \\nby cardiac catheterization, but echocardiography may confirm \\nthe presence of right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular \\ndysfunction, interventricular septal flattening, and tricuspid \\ninsufficiency, which can be used to estimate the pulmonary \\nartery pressures. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be \\nuseful in diagnosis and to assess changes in ventricular function \\nand size. Lung biopsy may be considered for children with \\nPAH suspected of diffuse lung disease, pulmonary venoocclusive \\ndisease, or vasculitis.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nTreatment should focus on the underlying condition of known \\ncauses of PH, such as lung volume optimization in persistent \\nPH of the newborn, or therapy with diuretics and salt/fluid \\nand interstitial spaces remain dry. Fluid entering the alveoli is \\nnormally removed by pulmonary lymphatics. Pulmonary edema \\nforms when transcapillary fluid flux exceeds lymphatic drainage. \\nReduced left ventricular function leads to pulmonary venous \\nhypertension and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, and \\nfluid moves into the interstitial space and alveoli. Fluid initially \\nenters the interstitial space around the terminal bronchioles, \\nalveoli, and arterioles (interstitial edema), causing increased \\nlung stiffness and premature closure of bronchioles on expiration. \\nIf the process continues, fluid then enters the alveoli, further \\nreducing compliance and resulting in intrapulmonary shunting \\n(alveolar units that are perfused but not ventilated). Decreased \\nventilation (hypercarbia) is a late finding.\\nPulmonary edema is most commonly due to heart failure \\nfrom left ventricular or biventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary \\nhypertension (PH) and associated cor pulmonale (right ven-\\ntricular dysfunction) do not usually cause pulmonary edema \\nas the increased vascular resistance is proximal to the capillary \\nbed. Increased capillary permeability, seen in disease states \\nsuch as sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, can \\nlead to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may also occur \\nwith excessive swings in intrathoracic pressure, as seen after \\ntracheal foreign body aspiration or severe obstruction from \\nhypertrophied tonsils and adenoids (postobstructive pulmonary \\nedema). Pulmonary edema may also be present in conditions \\nwith decreased serum oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia); \\nafter administration of large volumes of intravenous (IV) fluids, \\nespecially if there is capillary injury; with ascent to high altitude \\n(high-altitude pulmonary edema); and after central nervous \\nsystem injury (neurogenic pulmonary edema) .\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nCough\\nThe clinical manifestations of pulmonary edema are dyspnea, \\ntachypnea, and cough (can occur with frothy, pink-tinged \\nsputum).

It can be due to bleeding from the airways \\n(hemangiomas, bronchial vessel bleeds) or from diffuse capillary \\nbleeding (alveolar hemorrhage). Alveolar hemorrhage is usually \\ndue to diffuse capillary disruption/inflammation caused by \\nautoimmune disorders but can occur in isolation without \\nsystemic manifestations (pulmonary capillaritis). Airway \\nbleeding can be due to airway hemangiomas, pulmonary \\narteriovenous malformations (e.g., hereditary hemorrhagic \\ntelangiectasia), and bronchial artery collaterals, which develop \\nin some patients with chronic lung infections (e.g., cystic \\nfibrosis). Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a rare disorder \\ncharacterized by recurrent alveolar bleeding, iron deficiency \\nanemia, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the lung, which \\ncan be identified microscopically with the use of special iron-\\nstaining techniques in bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy \\nspecimens. Although the term hemosiderosis is sometimes used \\ninterchangeably with pulmonary hemorrhage, it is a pathological \\nfinding that results from bleeding anywhere in the lung, airway, \\npharynx, nasopharynx, or mouth leading to hemosiderin \\naccumulation in the lung.

Although \\nfound predominantly in people of European descent, CF is \\nreported among all races and ethnicities. The gene for CF , located \\non the long arm of chromosome 7, encodes for the cystic fibrosis \\ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride \\nchannel located on the apical surface of epithelial cells. CFTR \\nis important for the proper movement of salt and water across \\ncell membranes and maintaining the appropriate composition \\nof various secretions, especially in the airways, liver, and \\npancreas. The most common mutation is a deletion of three \\nbase pairs resulting in the absence of phenylalanine at the 508 \\nposition (Phe508del, F508del). Nearly 2,000 mutations of the \\nCFTR gene have been identified to date.\\nThe secretory and absorptive characteristics of epithelial \\ncells are affected by abnormal CFTR, resulting in the clinical \\nmanifestations of CF . The altered chloride ion conductance in \\nthe sweat gland results in excessively high sweat sodium and \\nchloride levels. This is the basis for the sweat chloride test, \\nwhich is still the standard diagnostic test for this disorder. \\nIt is positive (elevated sweat chloride ≥60 mE q/L) in 99% of \\npatients with CF . Abnormal airway secretions make the airway \\nmore prone to colonization with bacteria. Defects in CFTR \\nmay also reduce the function of airway defenses and promote \\nbacterial adhesion to the airway epithelium. This ultimately \\nleads to chronic airway infections and eventually to bronchial \\ndamage (bronchiectasis).\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nmarrow transplant can occur from immune-mediated causes \\nand from complications of diffuse alveolar damage. Rarely, a \\npreviously well infant will present with life-threatening acute \\nalveolar hemorrhage. Often no cause is found, and, once the \\nacute episode resolves, the infant returns to normal. Most of \\nthese infants never have a second bleeding episode. Hemoptysis \\ncan have cardiovascular, pulmonary, or immunological causes \\n(see Table 136.2).\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nIt is important to perform a thorough upper airway examination \\nto rule out epistaxis. Sometimes this requires nasopharyngos-\\ncopy. If extrapulmonary sources of bleeding have been excluded, \\nthen a chest radiograph, CT angiogram of the chest, bronchos-\\ncopy, echocardiogram, and evaluation for rheumatologic/\\nautoimmune diseases follow, especially to consider antiglo-\\nmerular basement membrane disease, granulomatosis with \\npolyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and systemic lupus \\nerythematosus.\\nTreatment\\nThe management of acute episodes of pulmonary bleeding \\nincludes the administration of supplemental O2, blood transfu-\\nsions, and, often with acute alveolar hemorrhages, mechanical \\nventilation with PEEP to tamponade the bleeding. Treatment \\nis directed toward the underlying disorders and providing \\nsupportive care. In bronchial arterial bleeding, arteriography \\nwith vessel embolization has been shown to be successful.\\nPulmonary Embolism\\nEtiology\\nPulmonary embolism is rare in children. When it occurs, it is \\noften associated with indwelling central venous catheters, oral \\ncontraceptives, or hypercoagulable states. Other risk factors, \\nsuch as trauma, surgery, immobilization, systemic lupus ery-\\nthematosus, and cancer, may lead to deep vein thromboses \\n(DVTs) and pulmonary embolism.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nBecause the pulmonary vascular bed is distensible, small emboli, \\neven if multiple, may be asymptomatic unless they are infected \\n(septic emboli) and cause pulmonary infection. Large emboli \\nmay cause acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, and \\nhemoptysis. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and unilateral calf swelling \\nmay be present. Hypoxia is common, as are nonspecific ST-\\nsegment and T-wave changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). \\nThe P2 heart sound may be increased.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nAlthough the chest x-ray is usually normal, atelectasis or \\ncardiomegaly may be seen. The measurement of D dimers can \\nbe used as a screening test, but it must be interpreted in light \\nof the probability of a pulmonary embolism. If the D dimer is \\nnormal and the probability for embolism is low, then no further \\nwork-up may be necessary. However, if the D dimer is elevated, \\nor if it is normal but the probability of embolism is moderate \\nor high, then the diagnostic test of choice is a CT angiogram \\nof the chest.

The treatment for \\nABPA is systemic corticosteroids (prednisone) and antifungal \\nagents (itraconazole). Minor hemoptysis is usually due to airway \\ninfection, but major hemoptysis is often caused by bleeding \\nfrom bronchial artery collateral vessels in damaged/chronically \\ninfected portions of the lung. Pneumothoraces can occur in \\npatients with advanced lung disease.\\nNinety percent of patients with CF are born with exocrine \\npancreatic insufficiency. The inspissation of mucus and \\nsubsequent destruction of the pancreatic ducts result in the \\ninability to excrete pancreatic enzymes into the intestine. This \\nleads to malabsorption of proteins, sugars (to a lesser extent), \\nand especially fat. Fat malabsorption manifests clinically as \\nsteatorrhea (large, foul-smelling stools), deficiencies of fat-\\nsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and failure to thrive. Protein \\nmalabsorption can present early in infancy as hypoproteinemia \\nand peripheral edema. Approximately 10% of patients with \\nCF are born with intestinal obstruction caused by inspissated \\nmeconium (meconium ileus). In older patients, intestinal \\nobstruction may result from thick inspissated mucus in the \\nintestinal lumen (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome \\n[DIOS]). In adolescent or adult patients, progressive pancreatic \\ndamage can lead to enough islet cell destruction to cause insulin \\ndeficiency. This initially presents as glucose intolerance, but \\ntrue diabetes that requires insulin therapy (CF-related diabetes) \\nmay develop. The failure of the sweat ducts to conserve sodium \\nand chloride may lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremic \\nmetabolic alkalosis, especially in infants. Inspissation of mucus \\nin the reproductive tract leads to reproductive dysfunction in \\nboth males and females. In males, congenital absence of the \\nvas deferens and azoospermia are nearly universal. In females, \\nsecondary amenorrhea is often present as a result of chronic \\nillness and reduced body weight. Fertility can be diminished by \\nmalnutrition and abnormal cervical mucus, but women with \\nCF can conceive.\\nAll infants with a positive newborn screen and/or with \\nmeconium ileus should be evaluated for CF . The diagnosis of \\nCF should be seriously considered in any infant presenting \\nwith failure to thrive, cholestatic jaundice, chronic respira-\\ntory symptoms, or electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, \\nhypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis). CF should be in the \\ndifferential diagnosis of children with chronic respiratory or \\ngastrointestinal symptoms, especially if there is digital clubbing. \\nAny child with nasal polyps, especially those younger than 12 \\nCF is a chronic progressive disease that can present with protein \\nand fat malabsorption (failure to thrive, hypoalbuminemia, \\nsteatorrhea), liver disease (cholestatic jaundice), or chronic \\nrespiratory infection (Table 137.1). Many infants in the United \\nStates are currently diagnosed by newborn screening (available \\nin all 50 states and the District of Columbia since 2010). Older \\nchildren have traditionally presented with pulmonary manifesta-\\ntions such as chronic cough, poorly controlled asthma, and \\nchronic respiratory infections, but recurrent pancreatitis, nasal \\npolyps, and chronic sinusitis can also be presenting manifesta-\\ntions.

As \\nwith other severe chronic diseases, management of CF patients \\nrequires a multidisciplinary team working with patients and \\ntheir families to maintain an optimistic, comprehensive, and \\naggressive approach to treatment.\\nCHAPTER 138 \\nChest Wall and Pleura\\nThoracic scoliosis, when it is severe (curve >60 degrees), can \\nbe associated with chest wall deformity and limitation of chest \\nwall movement (see Chapter 202). This, in turn, can lead to \\ndecreased lung volumes (restrictive lung disease), ventilation-\\nperfusion mismatching, hypoventilation, and even respiratory \\nfailure (see Chapter 39). Surgical correction of scoliosis may \\nprevent further loss of lung function, but it rarely improves \\npulmonary function beyond presurgical levels.\\nPECTUS EXCAVATUM AND CARINATUM\\nPectus Excavatum\\nSternal concavity (pectus excavatum), a common chest wall \\ndeformity in children, is usually not associated with significant \\npulmonary compromise. Patients with pectus excavatum gener-\\nally come to medical attention because of concerns over the \\nappearance of the chest. However, occasionally, if severe, it \\nmay result in restrictive lung disease, obstructive defects, and/\\nor decreased cardiac function. Adolescents with pectus exca-\\nvatum may complain of exercise intolerance. Routine spirometry \\nis often normal but may show decreased vital capacity consistent \\nwith restrictive lung disease. The main reason for surgical \\ncorrection is generally to improve appearance (cosmetic reasons), \\nalthough in some cases surgical repair is justified to improve \\ncardiac function and exercise tolerance.\\nconsequence are considered to have CFTR-related metabolic \\nsyndrome (CRMS). Older children that present with atypical \\nclinical features and borderline sweat tests may be considered \\nnonclassic CF or mild variant CF .\\nIdentification of carriers (heterozygotes) and prenatal diag-\\nnosis of children with the ΔF508 and other common mutations \\nis offered at most medical centers. Prenatal testing techniques \\ncan identify more than 90% of carriers. Prenatal detection of \\na known CF genotype may be accomplished by amniocentesis \\nor chorionic villus sampling.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe treatment of CF is multifactorial. Most maintenance thera-\\npies are directed toward the gastrointestinal and pulmonary \\ncomplications. Presently, there is no effective single cure for \\nCF . Precision therapies, known as CFTR modulators, target \\ngenotype-specific functional defects of the CFTR protein. \\nIvacaftor, the first CFTR modulator approved by the U.S. Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA), is a small molecule potentiator \\nthat improves CFTR function in a small group of CF individuals \\nwho have an abnormal gating mechanism of their CFTR protein, \\ncontributing to sustained health improvements including lung \\nfunction. The second FDA-approved medication is a combination \\nof ivacaftor and lumacaftor, approved for individuals with two \\ncopies of the most common CFTR mutation, F508del. It has \\nbeen associated with a modest but significant improvement \\nin lung function, improved body mass index, and a decrease \\nin hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations. Clinical \\ntrials are actively underway for the next generation of CFTR  \\nmodulators.\\nTreatment with CFTR modulator therapy does not preclude \\nmanagement of pulmonary complications. Management \\nof pulmonary exacerbations is directed toward facilitating \\nclearance of secretions from the airways and minimizing the \\neffects of chronic bronchial infection. Airway secretion clear-\\nance techniques (chest physiotherapy) help remove mucus \\nfrom the airways, and aerosolized DNAse and 7% hypertonic \\nsaline, both delivered by nebulizer, decrease the viscosity of \\nmucus. Antibiotic therapy is important in controlling chronic \\ninfection. Monitoring pulmonary bacterial flora via airway \\ncultures and providing aggressive therapy with appropriate \\nantibiotics (oral, aerosolized, and intravenous [IV]) help to \\nslow the progression of lung disease. Patients often require \\n2-3–week courses of high-dose IV antibiotics and aggres-\\nsive chest physiotherapy to treat pulmonary exacerbations. \\nAntibiotics are selected based on organisms identified by \\nsputum culture. If patients are unable to provide sputum, \\nthen a throat culture for CF pathogens can be used to direct \\ntherapy. Common infecting organisms include P . aeruginosa and  \\nS. aureus.\\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with enteric-\\ncoated pancreatic enzyme capsules, which contain lipase and \\nproteases. Patients with CF are encouraged to follow high-calorie \\ndiets, often with the addition of nutritional supplements. Even \\nwith optimal pancreatic enzyme replacement, stool losses of fat \\nand protein may be high. Fat should not be withheld from the \\ndiet, even when significant steatorrhea exists. Rather, pancreatic \\nenzyme doses should be titrated to optimize fat absorption, \\nalthough there is a limit to the doses that should be used. \\nLipase dosages exceeding 2,500 U/kg p er meal are concerning \\nbecause they have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy. \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Small pneu -\\nmothoraces (<20% of thorax occupied with pleural air) may \\nnot require intervention as they often resolve spontaneously. \\nInhaling high concentrations of supplemental O2 may enhance \\nreabsorption of pleural air by washing out nitrogen from the \\nblood. Larger pneumothoraces and any tension pneumothorax \\nrequire immediate drainage of the air, preferably via chest tube. \\nIn an emergency situation, a simple needle aspiration may \\nsuffice, although placement of a chest tube is often required \\nfor resolution. In patients with recurrent or persistent pneu-\\nmothoraces, sclerosing the pleural surfaces to obliterate the \\npleural space (pleurodesis) may be necessary. This can be done \\neither chemically, by instilling talc or sclerosis agents (doxy-\\ncycline) through the chest tube, or mechanically, by surgical \\nabradement. Surgical approaches, such as open thoracotomy \\nand video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (V ATS), enable \\nvisualization of the pleural space and resection of pleural blebs, \\nwhen indicated. Airline travel and spirometry may be restricted \\nfor a period of time (2 weeks or longer) following radiographic \\nresolution of the pneumothorax to minimize risk of \\nrecurrence.\\nPNEUMOMEDIASTINUM\\nPneumomediastinum results from the dissection of air from \\nthe pulmonary parenchyma into the mediastinum. It is usually \\na mild, self-limited process that does not require aggressive \\nintervention. The most common causes in children are severe \\nforceful coughing and acute asthma exacerbations. Common \\nsymptoms are chest pain and dyspnea. There are often no \\nphysical findings, although a crunching noise over the sternum \\ncan sometimes be appreciated on auscultation and subcutaneous \\nemphysema may be detected about the neck. The diagnosis is \\nconfirmed by chest radiograph, and treatment is directed toward \\nthe underlying lung disease.\\nPLEURAL EFFUSION\\nEtiology\\nFluid accumulates in the pleural space when the local hydrostatic \\nforces that are pushing fluid out of the vascular space exceed \\nthe oncotic forces that are drawing fluid back into the vascular \\nspace. Pleural effusions can be transudates (intact membrane \\nbut abnormal hydrostatic or oncotic forces) or exudates \\n(decreased integrity of the membrane due to inflammatory \\nprocesses or impaired lymphatic drainage). There are relatively \\nfew causes of transudates, the primary ones being congestive \\nheart failure and hypoproteinemia states, whereas the causes \\nof exudates are numerous. Almost any pulmonary inflammatory \\nprocess can result in pleural fluid accumulation. Among the \\nmost common causes of exudates are infection (e.g., tuberculosis, \\nbacterial pneumonia), collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic \\nlupus erythematosus), and malignancy. Chylous pleural effusions \\n(elevated triglyceride levels) are seen with thoracic duct injury \\nand abnormalities of lymphatic drainage (lymphangiomyoma-\\ntosis, lymphangiectasia). Bacterial pneumonia can lead to an \\nPectus Carinatum\\nPectus carinatum is an abnormality of chest wall shape in which \\nthe sternum bows out. It is not associated with abnormal \\npulmonary function. Underlying pulmonary disease may \\ncontribute to the deformity. It can be observed after cardiac \\nsurgery performed via midsternal approach. Surgical correction \\nof this condition is rarely indicated, but occasionally is done \\nfor cosmetic purposes.\\nPNEUMOTHORAX\\nEtiology\\nPneumothorax, which is the accumulation of air in the pleural \\nspace, may result from external trauma or from leakage of air \\nfrom the lungs or airways. Spontaneous primary pneumothorax \\n(no underlying cause) occurs in teenagers and young adults, \\nmore commonly in tall, thin males and smokers. Factors \\npredisposing to secondary pneumothorax (underlying cause \\nidentified) include barotrauma from mechanical ventilation, \\nasthma, cystic fibrosis, trauma to the chest, and severe necrotiz-\\ning pneumonia.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nChest Pain\\nThe most common signs and symptoms of pneumothorax are \\nchest and shoulder pain and dyspnea. If the pneumothorax is \\ncaused by air that enters the pleural space during inspiration \\nand cannot escape, mediastinal shift and functional lung \\ncompression may occur, resulting in tension pneumothorax \\nwith severe respiratory distress and hemodynamic changes \\n(reduced venous return to the heart). Subcutaneous emphysema \\nmay result when the air leak communicates with the medias-\\ntinum. Physical findings associated with pneumothorax include \\ndecreased breath sounds on the affected side, a tympanitic \\npercussion note, and evidence of mediastinal shift (deviation \\nof the point of maximal impact [PMI] and trachea away from \\nthe side of the pneumothorax). If the pneumothorax is small, \\nthere may be few or no clinical findings. However, the patient’s \\nclinical condition can deteriorate rapidly if the pneumothorax \\nexpands, especially if the air in the pleural space is under \\npressure (tension pneumothorax). This is a life-threatening \\ncondition that can result in death if the pleural space is not \\ndecompressed by evacuation of the pleural air.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nThe presence of a pneumothorax can usually be confirmed by \\nupright chest radiographs. Computed tomography (CT) scans \\nof the chest are useful in quantifying the size of pneumothoraces \\nand differentiating air within the lung parenchyma (cystic lung \\ndisease) from air in the pleural space and for identifying \\nsubpleural blebs that may be present in spontaneous recurrent \\npneumothoraces.

Routine tests on pleural fluid such \\nas cell count, pH, protein, lactose dehydrogenase, and glucose \\ncharacterize the effusions. Triglyceride levels, cytology, hema-\\ntocrit, gram and acid-fast bacilli stain, culture, and adenosine \\ndeaminase levels can be useful in diagnosing chylous, malignant, \\nand tuberculous effusions (Table 138.1).

Schneider\\nCHAPTER 139 \\nCardiovascular System \\nAssessment\\nHISTORY\\nA maternal history of medication, drug, or alcohol use or \\nexcessive smoking may contribute to cardiac and other systemic \\nfindings. The prenatal history may reveal a maternal infection \\nearly in pregnancy (possibly teratogenic) or later in pregnancy \\n(causing myocarditis or myocardial dysfunction in infants). \\nInfants with heart failure exhibit poor growth, with weight \\nbeing more significantly affected than height and head \\ncircumference.\\nHeart failure may present with fatigue or diaphoresis with \\nfeeds or fussiness. Tachypnea without significant dyspnea may \\nbe present. Older children with heart failure may have easy \\nfatigability, shortness of breath on exertion, and, sometimes, \\northopnea. Not keeping up with other children during play or \\nexercise is a sign of exercise intolerance. Heart failure may be \\nmisdiagnosed as recurrent pneumonia, bronchitis, wheezing, \\nor asthma.\\nA history of a heart murmur is important, but many well \\nchildren have an innocent murmur at some time in their lives. \\nOther cardiac symptoms include cyanosis, palpitations, chest \\npain, syncope, and near-syncope. A review of systems assesses for \\npossible systemic diseases or congenital malformation syndromes \\nthat may cause cardiac abnormalities (Tables 139.1 and 139.2). \\nCurrent and past medication use as well as history of drug use \\nis important. Family history should be reviewed for hereditary \\ndiseases, early atherosclerotic heart disease, congenital heart \\ndisease, sudden unexplained deaths, thrombophilia, rheumatic \\nfever, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nA complete cardiovascular examination starts in the supine \\nposition and includes evaluation in sitting and standing posi-\\ntions, when possible. Inspection is supplemented by palpation \\nand auscultation to provide a complete examination.\\nThe examination starts with vital signs. The normal heart \\nrate varies with age and activity. Newborn resting heart rates \\nare approximately 120 beats per minute, slightly higher in \\ninfants 3-6 months of age, and then gradually declining through \\nadolescence to near 80 beats per minute. The range of normal \\nfor any given age is approximately 30 beats per minute above \\nor below the average. Tachycardia may be a manifestation of \\nanemia, dehydration, shock, heart failure, or dysrhythmia. \\nBradycardia can be a normal finding in patients with high \\nvagal tone (athletes) but may be a manifestation of atrioven-\\ntricular block. The respiratory rate of infants is best assessed \\nwhile the infant is quiet. Respiratory rate may be increased \\nwhen there is a left-to-right shunt or pulmonary venous  \\ncongestion.\\nNormal blood pressure also varies with age. A properly \\nsized cuff should have a bladder width that is at least 90% and a \\nlength that is 80-100% of the arm circumference. Initially, blood \\npressure in the right arm is measured. If elevated, measurements \\nin the left arm and legs are indicated to evaluate for possible \\ncoarctation of the aorta. The pulse pressure is determined by \\nsubtracting the diastolic pressure from the systolic pressure. \\nIt is normally below 50  mm Hg or half the systolic pressure, \\nwhichever is less. A wide pulse pressure may be seen with \\naortopulmonary connections (patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], \\ntruncus arteriosus, arteriovenous malformations), aortic insuf-\\nficiency, or relative intravascular volume depletion (anemia, \\nvasodilation with fever or sepsis). A narrow pulse pressure is seen \\nwith pericardial tamponade, aortic stenosis, and heart failure.\\nInspection includes general appearance, nutritional status, \\ncirculation, and respiratory effort. Many chromosomal abnor-\\nmalities and syndromes associated with cardiac defects have \\ndysmorphic features or failure to thrive (see Table 139.2). Skin \\ncolor must be assessed for cyanosis and pallor. Central cyanosis \\n(tongue, lips) is associated with arterial desaturation; isolated \\nperipheral cyanosis (hands, feet) is associated with normal arte-\\nrial saturation and increased peripheral extraction of oxygen. \\nPerioral cyanosis is a common finding, especially in pale infants \\nor when infants and toddlers become cold. Chronic arterial \\ndesaturation results in clubbing of the fingernails and toenails. \\nInspection of the chest may reveal asymmetry or a prominent \\nleft precordium, suggesting chronic cardiac enlargement.\\nAfter inspection, palpation  of pulses in all four extremi -\\nties, the precordial activity, and the abdomen is performed. \\nPulses are assessed for rate, regularity, intensity, symmetry, and \\ntiming between upper and lower extremities. A good pedal \\npulse with normal right arm blood pressure effectively rules \\nout coarctation of the aorta. The precordium should be assessed \\nfor apical impulse, point of maximum impulse, hyperactivity, \\nand presence of a thrill. Abdominal palpation assesses liver and \\nspleen size. The liver size provides an assessment of intravascular \\nvolume and is enlarged with systemic venous congestion. The \\nspleen may be enlarged with infective endocarditis.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Systematic listening in a \\nquiet room allows assessment of each portion of the cardiac \\ncycle. In addition to heart rate and regularity, the heart sounds, \\nclicks, and murmurs need to be timed and characterized.\\nHeart Sounds\\nS1 is associated with closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves, \\nis usually single, and is best heard at the lower left sternal \\nborder (LLSB) or apex (Fig. 139.1). Although it can normally \\nbe split, if a split S1 is heard, the possibility of an ejection click \\nor, much less commonly, an S4 should be considered. S2 is \\nassociated with closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. It \\nshould normally split with inspiration and be single with \\nexhalation. Abnormalities of splitting and intensity of the \\npulmonary component are associated with significant anatomical \\nand physiological abnormalities (Table 139.3). S3 is heard in \\nearly diastole and is related to rapid ventricular filling. It is \\nbest heard at the LLSB or apex and may be a normal sound, \\nbut a loud S3 is abnormal and heard in conditions with dilated \\nventricles. S4 occurs late in diastole just before S1; it is best \\nheard at the LLSB/apex and is associated with decreased \\nventricular compliance. It is rare and is always abnormal.\\nClicks\\nA click implies a valvular abnormality or dilated great artery. \\nIt may be ejection or midsystolic in timing and may or may \\nnot be associated with a murmur. A midsystolic click is associ-\\nated with mitral valve prolapse. Ejection clicks occur early in \\nsystole. Pulmonary ejection clicks are best heard at the left  \\nupper sternal border and vary in intensity with respiration. \\nAortic clicks are often louder at the apex, left midsternal \\nTABLE 139.1 Cardiac Manifestations of Systemic \\nDiseases\\nSYSTEMIC DISEASE CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS\\nHunter-Hurler syndrome Valvular insufficiency, heart failure, \\nhypertension\\nDuchenne dystrophy Cardiomyopathy, heart failure\\nPompe disease Short PR interval, cardiomegaly, heart \\nfailure, arrhythmias\\nKawasaki disease Coronary artery aneurysm, thrombosis, \\nmyocardial infarction, myocarditis\\nMarfan syndrome Aortic and mitral insufficiency, \\ndissecting aortic aneurysm\\nJuvenile rheumatoid \\narthritis\\nPericarditis\\nSystemic lupus \\nerythematosus\\nPericarditis, Libman-Sacks \\nendocarditis, congenital AV block\\nLyme disease Arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure\\nGraves disease \\n(hyperthyroidism)\\nTachycardia, arrhythmias, heart failure\\nTuberous sclerosis Cardiac rhabdomyoma\\nNeurofibromatosis Pulmonic stenosis, coarctation of aorta\\nAV, Atrioventricular.\\nTABLE 139.2 Congenital Malformation Syndromes \\nAssociated With Congenital Heart Disease\\nSYNDROME CARDIAC FEATURES\\nTrisomy 21 (Down syndrome) Endocardial cushion defect, VSD, \\nASD, PDA\\nTrisomy 18 VSD, ASD, PDA, PS\\nTrisomy 13 VSD, ASD, PDA, dextrocardia\\nXO (Turner syndrome) Coarctation of aorta, aortic \\nstenosis\\nCHARGE association \\n(coloboma, heart, atresia \\nchoanae, retardation, genital \\nand ear anomalies)\\nTOF, aortic arch and conotruncal \\nanomalies*\\n22q11 (DiGeorge) syndrome Aortic arch anomalies, conotruncal \\nanomalies*\\nVACTERL association† \\n(vertebral, anal, cardiac, \\ntracheoesophageal, radial, \\nrenal, limb anomalies)\\nVSD\\nMarfan syndrome Dilated and dissecting aorta, \\naortic valve regurgitation, mitral \\nvalve prolapse\\nWilliam syndrome Supravalvular aortic stenosis, \\nperipheral pulmonary stenosis\\nInfant of diabetic mother Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, \\nVSD, conotruncal anomalies\\nAsplenia syndrome Complex cyanotic heart lesions, \\nanomalous pulmonary venous \\nreturn, dextrocardia, single \\nventricle, single AV valve\\nPolysplenia syndrome Azygos continuation of inferior \\nvena cava, pulmonary atresia, \\ndextrocardia, single ventricle\\nFetal alcohol syndrome VSD, ASD\\nFetal hydantoin syndrome TGA, VSD, TOF\\n*Conotruncal—tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, transposi-\\ntion of great arteries.\\n†VACTERL association is also known as VATER association, in which the limb \\nanomalies are not included.\\nASD, Atrial septal defect; AV, atrioventricular; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; \\nPS, pulmonic stenosis; TGA, transposition of great arteries; TOF, tetralogy of \\nFallot; VSD, ventricular septal defect.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHeart Murmurs\\nMurmur evaluation should determine timing, duration, location, \\nintensity, radiation, and frequency or pitch of the murmur.

A late regurgitant murmur may be \\nheard after a midsystolic click in mitral valve prolapse.\\nMurmurs are often heard along the path of blood flow. \\nEjection murmurs usually are best heard at the base of the \\nheart, whereas holosystolic murmurs are louder at the LLSB \\nand apex. Pulmonary ejection murmurs radiate to the back \\nand axilla. Aortic ejection murmurs radiate to the neck. The \\nintensity or loudness of a heart murmur is assessed as grade I \\nthrough VI (Table 139.4). The frequency or pitch of a murmur \\nprovides information regarding the pressure gradient. The higher \\nthe pressure gradient across a narrowed area (valve, vessel, or \\ndefect), the faster the flow and higher the frequency of the \\nmurmur. Low-frequency murmurs imply low-pressure gradients \\nand mild obstruction or less restriction to flow.\\nDiastolic murmurs are much less common than systolic \\nmurmurs and should be considered abnormal.

Assessment of the location and size of the \\nheart and cardiac silhouette may suggest a cardiac defect. On \\na good inspiratory film, the cardiothoracic ratio should be less \\nthan 55% in infants under 1 year of age and less than 50% in \\nolder children and adolescents. An enlarged heart may be due \\nto an increased volume load (left-right shunt) or due to myo-\\ncardial dysfunction (dilated cardiomyopathy). The shape of the \\nheart may suggest specific congenital heart defects. The most \\ncommon examples are the boot-shaped heart seen with tetralogy \\nof Fallot, the egg-on-a-string seen with dextroposed transposition \\nof the great arteries, and the “snowman” seen with supracardiac \\ntotal anomalous pulmonary venous return. The chest x-ray can \\naid in the assessment of pulmonary blood flow. Defects associ-\\nated with left-to-right shunting have increased pulmonary blood \\nflow (shunt vascularity) on x-ray. Right-to-left shunts have \\ndecreased pulmonary blood flow.\\nEchocardiography\\nEchocardiography has become the most important noninvasive \\ntool in the diagnosis and management of cardiac disease, \\nproviding a full anatomical evaluation in most congenital heart \\ndefects (Fig. 139.4). Physiological data on the direction of blood \\nflow can be obtained with the use of pulsed, continuous wave, \\nand color flow Doppler. Imaging from multiple views provides \\nThe P wave represents atrial depolarization. A criterion for \\nright atrial enlargement is an increase of the amplitude of the \\nP wave, reflected best in lead II. The diagnosis of left atrial \\nenlargement is made by prolongation of the second portion \\nof the P wave, exhibited best in the chest leads.\\nThe PR interval, measured from the beginning of the P \\nwave to the beginning of the QRS complex, increases with age. \\nConduction time is shortened when the conduction velocity is \\nincreased (glycogen storage disease) or when the atrioventricular \\nnode is bypassed (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). A pro-\\nlonged PR interval usually indicates slow conduction through \\nthe atrioventricular node. Diseases in the atrial myocardium, \\nthe bundle of His, or the Purkinje system may also contribute \\nto prolonged PR intervals.\\nThe QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization. A \\ngreater ventricular volume or mass causes a greater magnitude \\nof the complex. The proximity of the right ventricle to the chest \\nsurface accentuates that ventricle’s contribution to the complex. \\nChanges in the normal ECG occur with age. Normative data \\nfor each age group must be known to make a diagnosis from \\nthe ECG.\\nThe QT interval is measured from the beginning of the \\nQRS complex to the end of the T wave. The corrected QT \\ninterval (corrected for rate) should be less than 0.45 second \\n()QTcQ Tp receding R to R interval= . The interval may be \\nprolonged in children with hypocalcemia or severe hypokalemia. \\nIt is also prolonged in a group of children at risk for severe \\nventricular arrhythmias and sudden death (prolonged QT \\nsyndrome).

Many pediatric dys -\\nrhythmias are normal variants that do not require treatment \\nor even further evaluation.\\nSinus rhythm originates in the sinus node and has a normal \\naxis P wave (upright in leads I and aVF) preceding each QRS \\ncomplex. Because normal rates vary with age, sinus bradycardia \\nand sinus tachycardia are defined based on age. Sinus arrhyth-\\nmia is a common finding in children and represents a normal \\nvariation in the heart rate associated with breathing. The heart \\nrate increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration, \\nproducing a recurring pattern on the electrocardiogram (ECG) \\ntracing. Sinus arrhythmia is normal and does not require further \\nevaluation or treatment.\\nAtrial Dysrhythmias\\nA wandering atrial pacemaker is a change in the morphology \\nof the P waves with variable PR interval and normal QRS \\ncomplex.

If there is structural heart disease or the \\nepisode is prolonged (>12 hours), there may be an alteration \\nin the cardiac output and development of symptoms of heart \\nfailure. Although most patients with SVT have structurally \\nnormal hearts and normal baseline ECGs, some children have \\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or preexcitation as the cause \\nof the dysrhythmia.\\nVentricular Dysrhythmias\\nPremature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are less common \\nthan premature atrial contractions in infancy but more common \\nin older children and adolescents (Table 142.2). The premature \\nbeat is not preceded by a P wave, and the QRS complex is \\nwide and bizarre. If the heart is structurally normal, and the \\nPVCs are singleton, uniform in focus, and disappear with \\nincreased heart rate, they are usually benign and require no \\ntreatment. Any deviation from the presentation (history of \\nsyncope or a family history of sudden death) requires further \\ninvestigation and possibly treatment with antiarrhythmic  \\nmedications.\\nVentricular tachycardia, defined as three or more consecu-\\ntive PVCs, is also relatively rare in pediatric patients. Although \\nthere are multiple causes of ventricular tachycardia, it usually \\nis a sign of serious cardiac dysfunction or disease. Rapid-rate \\nventricular tachycardia results in decreased cardiac output and \\ncardiovascular instability. Treatment in symptomatic patients \\nis synchronized cardioversion. Medical management with \\nlidocaine or amiodarone may be appropriate in a conscious \\nasymptomatic patient. Complete evaluation of the etiological \\npicture is necessary, including electrophysiological study.\\nHeart Block\\nFirst-degree heart block is the presence of a prolonged PR \\ninterval. It is asymptomatic and, when present in otherwise \\nnormal children, requires no evaluation or treatment. Second-\\ndegree heart block  is when some, but not all, of the P waves \\nare followed by a QRS complex. Mobitz type I (also known as \\nWenckebach) is characterized by a progressive prolongation \\nof the PR interval until a QRS complex is dropped. It is often \\nseen during sleep, usually does not progress to other forms of \\nheart block, and does not require further evaluation or treatment \\nin otherwise normal children. Mobitz type II is present when \\nthe PR interval does not change, but a QRS is intermittently \\ndropped. This form may progress to complete heart block and \\nmay require pacemaker placement. Third-degree heart block, \\nwhether congenital or acquired, is present when there is no \\nrelationship between atrial and ventricular activity. The ven-\\ntricular rate is much slower than the atrial rate. Congenital \\ncomplete heart block is associated with maternal collagen \\nvascular disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus or \\nSjögren syndrome) or congenital heart disease. The acquired \\nform most often occurs after cardiac surgery but may be second-\\nary to infection, inflammation, or drugs.\\nTREATMENT\\nMost atrial dysrhythmias require no intervention. Treatment of \\nSVT depends on presentation and symptoms. Acute treatment \\nof SVT in infants usually consists of vagal maneuvers, such \\nPremature atrial contractions  are relatively common \\nprenatally and in infants. A premature P wave, usually with \\nan abnormal axis consistent with its ectopic origin, is present. \\nThe premature atrial activity may be blocked (no QRS following \\nit), conducted normally (normal QRS present), or conducted \\naberrantly (a widened, altered QRS complex). Premature atrial \\ncontractions are usually benign and, if present around the time \\nof delivery, usually disappear during the first few weeks of life.\\nAtrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are uncommon dys -\\nrhythmias in pediatrics and usually present after surgical repair \\nof complex congenital heart disease. They may also be seen in \\npatients with myocarditis or in association with drug toxicity.\\nSupraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common \\nsymptomatic dysrhythmia in pediatric patients. The rhythm \\nhas a rapid, regular rate with a narrow QRS complex. SVT in \\ninfants is often 280-300 beats per minute with slower rates for \\nolder children and adolescents. The tachycardia has an abrupt \\nonset and termination.

The \\nspectrum of lesions ranges from asymptomatic to fatal. Although \\nmost cases of congenital heart disease are multifactorial, some \\nlesions are associated with chromosomal disorders, single gene \\ndefects, teratogens, or maternal metabolic disease (see Table \\n139-2).\\nCongenital heart defects can be divided into three pathophysi-\\nological groups (Table 143.1).\\n1. L eft-to-right shunts\\n2. R ight-to-left shunts\\n3. O bstructive, stenotic lesions\\nAcyanotic congenital heart disease includes left-to-right \\nshunts resulting in an increase in pulmonary blood flow (patent \\nductus arteriosus [PDA], ventricular septal defect [VSD], atrial \\nseptal defect [ASD]) and obstructive lesions (aortic stenosis, \\npulmonary stenosis, coarctation of the aorta), which usually \\nhave normal pulmonary blood flow.\\nVENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe ventricular septum is a complex structure that can be divided \\ninto four components. The largest component is the muscular \\nseptum. The inlet or posterior septum comprises endocardial \\ncushion tissue. The subarterial or supracristal septum com -\\nprises conotruncal tissue. The membranous septum is below \\nthe aortic valve and is relatively small. VSDs occur when any \\nof these components fail to develop normally (Fig. 143.1).

The ECG may show right axis deviation and right \\nventricular enlargement. A chest radiograph may show car -\\ndiomegaly, right atrial enlargement, and a prominent pulmonary \\nartery.\\nTreatment\\nMedical management is rarely indicated. If a significant shunt \\nis still present at around 3 years of age, closure is usually recom-\\nmended. Many secundum ASDs can be closed with an ASD \\nclosure device in the catheterization laboratory. Primum and \\nsinus venosus defects require surgical closure.\\nPATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe ductus arteriosus allows blood to flow from the pulmonary \\nartery to the aorta during fetal life. Failure of the normal closure \\nof this vessel results in a PDA (Fig. 143.3). With falling pul-\\nmonary vascular resistance after birth, left-to-right shunting \\nof blood and increased pulmonary blood flow occur. Excluding \\npremature infants, PDAs represent approximately 5-10% of \\ncongenital heart disease.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nSymptoms depend on the amount of pulmonary blood flow. \\nThe magnitude of the shunt depends on the size of the PDA \\n(diameter, length, and tortuosity) and the pulmonary vascular \\nresistance. Small PDAs are asymptomatic; moderate to large \\nshunts can produce the symptoms of heart failure as the pul-\\nmonary vascular resistance decreases.\\nThe physical examination findings depend on the size of the \\nshunt. A widened pulse pressure is often present as a result \\nof the runoff of blood into the pulmonary circulation during \\ndiastole. A continuous, machine-like murmur can be heard \\nat the left infraclavicular area, radiating along the pulmonary \\narteries and often well heard over the left side of the back. Larger \\nshunts with increased flow across the mitral valve may result \\npoor growth or pulmonary hypertension despite therapy requires \\nclosure of the defect. Most VSDs are closed surgically, but some \\nVSDs, especially muscular defects, can be closed with devices \\nplaced at cardiac catheterization.\\nATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nDuring the embryological development of the heart, a septum \\ngrows toward the endocardial cushions to divide the atria. \\nFailure of septal growth or excessive reabsorption of tissue \\nleads to ASDs (Fig. 143.2). ASDs represent approximately 10% \\nof all congenital heart defects. A secundum defect, with the \\nhole in the region of the foramen ovale, is the most common \\nASD. A primum ASD, located near the endocardial cushions, \\nmay be part of a complete atrioventricular canal defect or may \\nbe present with an intact ventricular septum. The least common \\nASD is the sinus venosus defect , which may be associated \\nwith anomalous pulmonary venous return.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe pathophysiology and amount of shunting depend on the \\nsize of the defect and the relative compliance of the both \\nventricles. Even with large ASDs and significant shunts, infants \\nand children are rarely symptomatic. A prominent right \\nventricular impulse at the left lower sternal border (LLSB) \\noften can be palpated. A soft (grade I or II) systolic ejection \\nmurmur in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract \\nand a fixed split S2 (due to overload of the right ventricle with \\nprolonged ejection into the pulmonary circuit) are often audible. \\nA larger shunt may result in a mid-diastolic murmur at the \\nLLSB as a result of the increased volume passing across the \\ntricuspid valve.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG and chest x-ray findings reflect the increased blood flow \\nthrough the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary arteries, \\nRA\\nRV\\nLV\\nLA\\nAO\\nPA\\nFIGURE 143.2 Atrial septal defect.

Pulmonary hypertension \\nis present due to the increased pulmonary blood flow and \\npulmonary vascular obstructive disease may develop early, \\nespecially in patients with Trisomy 21. The presence of murmurs \\nvaries depending on the amount of shunting at both atrial and \\nventricular levels. If there is a large VSD component, S2 will \\nbe single. Growth is usually poor. This is the most common \\ncongenital heart defect in children with Trisomy 21.\\nImaging Tests\\nThe diagnosis usually is made with echocardiography. A chest \\nradiograph reveals cardiomegaly with enlargement of all \\nchambers and the presence of increased vascularity. An ECG \\nreveals left axis deviation and combined ventricular hyper -\\ntrophy and may show combined atrial enlargement.\\nTreatment\\nInitial management includes diuretics. Some practitioners use \\nafterload reduction for treatment of heart failure but, ultimately, \\nsurgical repair of the defect is required.\\nPULMONARY STENOSIS\\nEtiology\\nPulmonary stenosis accounts for approximately 10% of all \\ncongenital heart disease and can be valvular, subvalvular, or \\nsupravalvular in nature. Pulmonary stenosis results from the \\nfailure of the development, in early gestation, of the three leaflets \\nof the valve, insufficient resorption of infundibular tissue, or \\ninsufficient canalization of the peripheral pulmonary \\narteries.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nSymptoms depend on the degree of obstruction present. Mild \\npulmonary stenosis is asymptomatic. Moderate to severe stenosis \\nresults in exertional dyspnea and easy fatigability. Newborns \\nwith severe stenosis may be more symptomatic and even cyanotic \\nbecause of right-to-left shunting at the atrial level.\\nPulmonary stenosis causes a systolic ejection murmur at the \\nsecond left intercostal space, which radiates to the back. A thrill \\nmay be present. S2 may be widely split with a quiet pulmonary \\ncomponent. With more severe pulmonary stenosis, an impulse \\nat the lower left sternal border results from right ventricular \\nhypertrophy. Valvular stenosis may result in a click that varies \\nwith respiration. Worsening stenosis causes an increase in the \\nduration of the murmur and a higher frequency of the sound. \\nThe systolic ejection murmurs of peripheral pulmonary stenosis \\nare heard distal to the site of obstruction in the pulmonary \\ncirculation, including radiation to the axillae and back.\\nImaging Tests\\nECG and chest x-ray findings are normal in mild stenosis. \\nModerate to severe stenosis results in right axis deviation  \\nin a mid-diastolic murmur at the apex and a hyperdynamic \\nprecordium. Splitting of S2 and intensity of P2 depend on the \\npulmonary artery pressure. A thrill may be palpable.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG and chest x-ray findings are normal with small PDAs. \\nModerate to large shunts may result in a full pulmonary artery \\nsilhouette and increased pulmonary vascularity. ECG findings \\nvary from normal to evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. \\nIf pulmonary hypertension is present, there is also right ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy.\\nTreatment\\nSpontaneous closure of a PDA after a few weeks of age is \\nuncommon in full-term infants. Moderate and large PDAs may \\nbe managed initially with diuretics, but they eventually require \\nclosure. Elective closure of small, hemodynamically insignificant \\nPDAs is controversial. Most PDAs can be closed in the catheter-\\nization laboratory by either coil embolization or a PDA closure \\ndevice.\\nENDOCARDIAL CUSHION DEFECT\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nEndocardial cushion defects, also referred to as atrioventricular \\ncanal defects or atrioventricular septal defects, may be complete \\n(Fig. 143.4), partial, or transitional. Abnormal development of \\nthe endocardial cushion tissue results in failure of the septum \\nto fuse with the endocardial cushion; this results in abnormal \\natrioventricular valves as well. The complete defect results \\nin a primum ASD, a posterior or inlet VSD, and a common \\natrioventricular valve with anterior and posterior bridging \\nleaflets. Partial and transitional defects have two separate \\natrioventricular valves, usually with a “cleft” in the anterior \\nleaflet of the left-sided valve. In addition to left-to-right \\nshunting at both levels, there may be atrioventricular valve  \\ninsufficiency.\\nRA\\nRV\\nLV\\nLA\\nAO\\nPA\\nFIGURE 143.4  Atrioventricular canal defects.

It is almost always juxtaductal in \\nposition. During development of the aortic arch, the area near \\nthe insertion of the ductus arteriosus fails to develop correctly, \\nresulting in a narrowing of the aortic lumen.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nTiming of presentation depends on the severity of obstruction \\nand associated cardiac defects. Infants presenting with coarcta-\\ntion of the aorta frequently have hypoplastic aortic arches, \\nabnormal aortic valves, and VSDs. They may be dependent on \\na PDA to provide descending aortic flow. Symptoms develop \\nwhen the aortic ampulla of the ductus closes. Less severe \\nobstruction causes no symptoms.\\nSymptoms, including poor feeding, respiratory distress, \\nand shock, may develop before 2 weeks of age. Classically, the \\nfemoral pulses  are weaker and delayed compared with the \\nright radial pulse. The blood pressure in the lower extremities \\nis lower than that in the upper extremities. However, if cardiac \\nfunction is poor, these differences may not be as apparent until \\nappropriate resuscitation is accomplished. In this situation, there \\nmay be no murmur, but an S3 is often present.\\nOlder children presenting with coarctation of the aorta are \\nusually asymptomatic. There may be a history of leg discomfort \\nwith exercise, headache, or epistaxis. Decreased or absent lower \\nextremity pulses, hypertension (upper extremity), or a murmur \\nmay be present. The murmur is typically best heard in the left  \\ninterscapular area of the back. If significant collaterals have \\ndeveloped, continuous murmurs may be heard throughout \\nthe chest. An abnormal aortic valve is present approximately \\n50% of the time, causing a systolic ejection click and systolic \\nejection murmur of aortic stenosis.\\nImaging Studies\\nThe ECG and chest x-ray show evidence of right ventricular \\nenlargement and hypertrophy in infantile coarctation with \\nmarked cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema . Echocar -\\ndiography shows the site of coarctation and associated \\nlesions. In older children, the ECG and chest x-ray usually \\nshow left ventricular hypertrophy and a mildly enlarged \\nheart. Rib notching may also be seen in older children ( >8 \\nyears of age) with large collaterals. Echocardiography shows \\nthe site and degree of coarctation, the presence of left ven -\\ntricular hypertrophy, and the aortic valve morphology and  \\nfunction.\\nTreatment\\nManagement of an infant presenting with cardiac decompensa-\\ntion includes intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 (chemi-\\ncally opens the ductus arteriosus), inotropic agents, diuretics, \\nand other supportive care. Balloon angioplasty has been done, \\nespecially in critically ill infants, but surgical repair  of the \\ncoarctation is most commonly performed. Ballooning and \\nstenting of older patients with coarctation has become more \\naccepted as primary therapy, but surgical repair remains a \\ncommon form of management.\\nand right ventricular hypertrophy . The heart size is usually \\nnormal on chest x-ray, although dilation of the main pul -\\nmonary artery  may be seen. Echocardiography provides \\nassessment of the site of stenosis, degree of hypertrophy, \\nvalve morphology, as well as an estimate of the pressure  \\ngradient.\\nTreatment\\nValvular pulmonary stenosis usually does not progress, especially \\nif it is mild. Balloon valvuloplasty  is usually successful in \\nreducing the gradient to acceptable levels for more significant \\nor symptomatic stenosis. Surgical repair is required if balloon \\nvalvuloplasty is unsuccessful or when subvalvular (muscular) \\nstenosis is present.\\nAORTIC STENOSIS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nValv u lar, subvalvular, or supravalvular aortic stenosis repre-\\nsents approximately 5% of all congenital heart disease. Lesions \\nresult from failure of development of the three leaflets or failure \\nof resorption of tissue around the valve.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nMild to moderate obstructions cause no symptoms. More severe \\nstenosis results in easy fatigability, exertional chest pain, and \\nsyncope. Infants with critical aortic stenosis may present with \\nsymptoms of heart failure.\\nA systolic ejection murmur  is heard at the right second \\nintercostal space along the sternum and radiating into the \\nneck. The murmur increases in length and becomes higher in \\nfrequency as the degree of stenosis increases. With valvular \\nstenosis, a systolic ejection click often is heard, and a thrill may \\nbe present at the right upper sternal border or in the supra -\\nsternal notch. The aortic component of S2 may be decreased in  \\nintensity.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG and chest x-ray findings are normal with mild degrees \\nof stenosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy develops with moder-\\nate to severe stenosis and is detected on the ECG and chest \\nx-ray. Dilation of the ascending aorta or aortic knob due to \\nan intrinsic aortopathy may be seen on chest radiographs. \\nEchocardiography shows the site of stenosis, valve morphology, \\nand the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and it allows \\nan estimate of the pressure gradient.\\nTreatment\\nThe degree of aortic stenosis frequently progresses with growth \\nand age. Aortic insufficiency often develops or progresses. Serial \\nfollow-up with echocardiography is indicated. Balloon valvu-\\nloplasty is usually the first interventional procedure for sig -\\nnificant stenosis. It is not as successful as pulmonary balloon \\nvalvuloplasty and has a higher risk of significant valvular \\ninsufficiency. Surgical management is necessary when balloon \\nvalvuloplasty is unsuccessful or significant valve insufficiency \\ndevelops.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

There are four structural defects: ventricular \\nseptal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, \\nand right ventricular hypertrophy. Tetralogy of Fallot is due \\nto abnormal septation of the truncus arteriosus into the aorta \\nand pulmonary artery that occurs early in gestation (3-4 weeks). \\nThe VSD is large, and the pulmonary stenosis is most commonly \\nsubvalvular or infundibular. It may also be valvular, supraval-\\nvular, or, frequently, a combination of levels of obstruction.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nInfants initially may be acyanotic. A pulmonary stenosis \\nmurmur is the usual initial abnormal finding. The amount of \\nright-to-left shunting at the VSD (and the degree of cyanosis) \\nincreases as the degree of pulmonary stenosis increases. With \\nincreasing severity of pulmonary stenosis, the murmur becomes \\nshorter and softer. In addition to varying degrees of cyanosis \\nand a murmur, a single S2 and right ventricular impulse at \\nthe left sternal border are typical findings.\\nCHAPTER 144 \\nCyanotic Congenital  \\nHeart Disease\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nCyanosis\\nHeart Murmurs\\nTABLE 144.1 Categories of Presenting Symptoms and Signs in the Neonate\\nSYMPTOM/SIGN PHYSIOLOGICAL CATEGORY ANATOMICAL CAUSE LESION\\nCyanosis with respiratory \\ndistress\\nIncreased pulmonary blood flow Transposition d-Transposition with or without \\nassociated lesions\\nCyanosis without respiratory \\ndistress\\nDecreased pulmonary blood flow Right heart obstruction Tricuspid atresia\\nEbstein anomaly\\nPulmonary atresia\\nPulmonary stenosis\\nTetralogy of Fallot\\nHypoperfusion Poor cardiac output Left heart obstruction Total anomalous pulmonary venous \\nreturn with obstruction\\nAortic stenosis\\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome\\nPoor cardiac function Normal anatomy Cardiomyopathy\\nMyocarditis\\nRespiratory distress with \\ndesaturation (not visible \\ncyanosis)\\nBidirectional shunting Complete mixing Truncus arteriosus\\nAV canal\\nComplex single ventricle (including \\nheterotaxias) without pulmonary stenosis\\nRespiratory distress with \\nnormal saturation\\nLeft-to-right shunting Simple intracardiac shunt ASD\\nVSD\\nPDA\\nAortopulmonary window\\nAVM\\nASD, Atrial septal defect; AV, atrioventricular; AVM, arteriovenous malformation; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; VSD, ventricular septal defect.\\nCyanotic congenital heart disease occurs when some of the \\nsystemic venous return crosses from the right side of the heart \\nto the left and returns to the body without going through the \\nlungs (right-to-left shunt).

Subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis is \\nindicated until 6 months after complete repair unless there is \\na residual VSD. Prophylaxis is then continued as long as there \\nis a residual VSD.\\nTRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT ARTERIES\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nAlthough dextroposed transposition of the great arteries \\nrepresents only about 5% of congenital heart defects, it is the \\nmost common cyanotic lesion to present in the newborn period \\n(Fig. 144.2). Transposition of the great arteries is ventriculoarte-\\nrial discordance secondary to abnormalities of septation of the \\ntruncus arteriosus. In dextroposed transposition, the aorta \\narises from the right ventricle, anterior and to the right of the \\npulmonary artery, which arises from the left ventricle. This \\nresults in desaturated blood returning to the right side of the \\nheart and being pumped back out to the body, while well-\\noxygenated blood returning from the lungs enters the left side \\nof the heart and is pumped back to the lungs. Without mixing \\nof the two circulations, death occurs quickly. Mixing can occur \\nat the atrial (patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect [ASD]), \\nVSD, or great vessel (patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]) level.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nA history of cyanosis is always present, although it depends \\non the amount of mixing. Quiet tachypnea and a single S2 are \\ntypically present. If the ventricular septum is intact, there may \\nbe no murmur.\\nChildren with transposition and a large VSD have improved \\nintracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with \\nsigns of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable \\nleft and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is \\nheard. S2 is single.\\nWhen hypoxic (Tet) spells occur, they are usually progressive. \\nDuring a spell, the child typically becomes restless and agitated \\nand may cry inconsolably. An ambulatory toddler may squat. \\nHyperpnea occurs with gradually increasing cyanosis and loss \\nof the murmur. In severe spells, prolonged unconsciousness and \\nconvulsions, hemiparesis, or death may occur. Independent of \\nhypoxic spells, patients with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot are \\nat increased risk for cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral \\nabscesses resulting, in part, from their right-to-left intracardiac \\nshunt.\\nImaging Studies\\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) usually has right axis deviation \\nand right ventricular hypertrophy . The classic chest x-ray \\nfinding is a boot-shaped heart created by the small main \\npulmonary artery and upturned apex secondary to right \\nventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography shows the anatomical \\nfeatures, including the anatomical level and quantification of \\npulmonary stenosis. Coronary anomalies, most commonly a \\nleft anterior descending coronary artery arising from the right \\ncoronary artery and crossing the anterior surface of the right \\nventricular outflow tract, are present in 5% of patients with \\ntetralogy of Fallot.\\nTreatment\\nThe natural history of tetralogy of Fallot is progression of \\npulmonary stenosis and cyanosis. Treatment of hypoxic spells \\nconsists of oxygen administration and placing the child in the \\nknee-chest position (to increase venous return). Traditionally, \\nmorphine sulfate is given (to relax the pulmonary infundibulum \\nand for sedation). If necessary, the systemic vascular resistance \\ncan be increased acutely through the administration of an \\nα-adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine). The occurrence of a \\ncyanotic spell is an indication to proceed with surgical repair.\\nComplete surgical repair with VSD closure and removal or \\npatching of the pulmonary stenosis can be performed in infancy. \\nRA\\nRV\\nLV\\nLA\\nAO\\nPA\\nFIGURE 144.2 Transposition of the great vessels.

Echocardiography shows \\nthe anatomy, associated lesions, and source of pulmonary  \\nblood flow.\\nTreatment\\nManagement initially depends on the presence of a VSD and \\nthe amount of antegrade blood flow to the lungs. If there is no \\nVSD, or it is small, prostaglandin E1 maintains pulmonary blood \\nflow until surgery. Surgery is staged with an initial subclavian \\nartery-to-pulmonary shunt (Blalock-Taussig procedure) \\ntypically followed by a two-stage procedure: bidirectional \\ncavopulmonary shunt (bidirectional Glenn) and Fontan \\nprocedure. These surgeries direct systemic venous return directly \\nto the pulmonary arteries.\\nTRUNCUS ARTERIOSUS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nTruncus arteriosus occurs in less than 1% of all cases of congenital \\nheart disease (Fig. 144.4). It results from the failure of septation \\nof the truncus during the first 3-4 weeks of gestation. A single \\narterial trunk arises from the heart with a large VSD immediately \\nbelow the truncal valve. The pulmonary arteries arise from the \\nsingle arterial trunk either as a single vessel that divides or \\nindividually from the arterial trunk to the lungs.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nVarying degrees of cyanosis depend on the amount of pulmonary \\nblood flow. If not diagnosed at birth, the infant may develop \\nsigns of heart failure as pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. \\nThe signs then include tachypnea and cough. Peripheral pulses \\nare usually bounding as a result of the diastolic runoff into the \\npulmonary arteries. A single S2 is due to the single valve. There \\nmay be a systolic ejection click, and there is often a systolic \\nmurmur at the left sternal border.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right \\nventricular hypertrophy . The chest x-ray reveals increased \\npulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically \\nan egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. \\nEchocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, \\nthe sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions.\\nTreatment\\nInitial medical management includes prostaglandin E 1 to \\nmaintain ductal patency. If significant hypoxia persists on \\nprostaglandin therapy, a balloon atrial septostomy improves \\nmixing between the two circulations. Complete surgical repair \\nis most often an arterial switch. The arterial switch usually is \\nperformed within the first 2 weeks of life, when the left ventricle \\ncan still maintain systemic pressure.\\nTRICUSPID ATRESIA\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nTricuspid atresia accounts for approximately 2% of all congenital \\nheart defects (Fig. 144.3). The absence of the tricuspid valve \\nresults in a hypoplastic right ventricle . All systemic venous \\nreturn must cross the atrial septum into the left atrium. A PDA \\nor VSD is necessary for pulmonary blood flow and survival.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nInfants with tricuspid atresia are usually severely cyanotic and \\nhave a single S2. If a VSD is present, there may be a murmur. \\nA diastolic murmur across the mitral valve may be audible. \\nFrequently there is no significant murmur.\\nImaging Studies\\nThe ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy and a superior \\nQRS axis (between 0 and −90 degrees).

Growth is relatively poor. Infants with \\nobstruction present with cyanosis, marked tachypnea and \\ndyspnea, and signs of right-sided heart failure including hepa-\\ntomegaly. The obstruction results in little, if any, increase in \\nright ventricular volume, so there may be no murmur or changes \\nin S2.\\nImaging Studies\\nFor infants without obstruction, the ECG is consistent with \\nright ventricular volume overload. Cardiomegaly with increased \\npulmonary blood flow is seen on chest x-ray. Infants with \\nobstructed veins have right axis deviation and right ventricular \\nhypertrophy on ECG. On chest x-ray, the heart is normal or \\nmildly enlarged with varying degrees of pulmonary edema \\nthat can appear similar to hyaline membrane disease or \\npneumonia. Echocardiography shows the volume-overloaded \\nright side of the heart, right-to-left atrial level shunting, and \\ncommon pulmonary vein site of drainage and degree of  \\nobstruction.\\nTreatment\\nAt surgery, the common pulmonary vein is opened into the \\nleft atrium, and there is ligation of any vein or channel that \\nhad been draining the common vein.\\nHYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART SYNDROME\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 1% of all congenital \\nheart defects (Fig. 144.6) but is the most common cause of \\ndeath from cardiac defects in the first month of life. Hypoplastic \\nleft heart syndrome occurs when there is failure of development \\nof the mitral or aortic valve or the aortic arch. A small left  \\nventricle that is unable to support normal systemic circulation \\nis a central finding, regardless of etiology. Associated degrees \\nof hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch are present. \\nLeft-to-right shunting occurs at the atrial level.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG findings include combined ventricular hypertrophy and \\ncardiomegaly. A chest x-ray usually reveals increased pulmo-\\nnary blood and may show displaced pulmonary arteries. \\nEchocardiography defines the anatomy, including the VSD, \\ntruncal valve function, and origin of the pulmonary arteries.\\nTreatment\\nMedical management is usually needed and includes anticonges-\\ntive medications. Surgical repair includes VSD closure and \\nplacement of a conduit between the right ventricle and pul-\\nmonary arteries.\\nTOTAL ANOMALOUS PULMONARY  \\nVENOUS RETURN\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return accounts for about \\n1% of congenital heart disease (Fig. 144.5). Disruption of the \\ndevelopment of normal pulmonary venous drainage during \\nthe third week of gestation results in one of four abnormalities. \\nAll of the pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium \\nand return abnormally via the right side of the heart. They \\nmay have supracardiac, infracardiac, cardiac, or mixed \\ndrainage. An atrial-level communication is required for systemic \\ncardiac output and survival.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe most important determinant of presentation is the presence \\nor absence of obstruction to the pulmonary venous drainage. \\nInfants without obstruction have minimal cyanosis and may \\nbe asymptomatic. There is a hyperactive right ventricular \\nimpulse with a widely split S 2 (owing to increased right \\nventricular volume) and a systolic ejection murmur at the left  \\nupper sternal border.

As the preload (fiber length, left ventricular \\nfilling pressure, or volume) increases, myocardial performance \\n(stroke volume and wall tension) increases up to a point (the \\nnormal Starling curve). The relationship is the ventricular \\nfunction curve (Fig. 145.1). Alterations in the contractile \\nstate of the muscle lower the relative position of the curve \\nbut retain the relationship of fiber length to muscle work. \\nThe cardiac output equals stroke volume times the heart rate; \\nthus heart rate is another important determinant of cardiac \\nwork. Additional factors also affect cardiac performance  \\n(Table 145.1).\\nHeart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump \\nblood at a rate commensurate with metabolic needs (in -\\nadequate oxygen delivery). It may be due to a change in \\nmyocardial contractility that results in low cardiac output \\nor to abnormal loading conditions being placed on the \\nmyocardium. The abnormal loading conditions may be \\nafterload (pressure overload, such as with aortic stenosis, \\npulmonary stenosis, or coarctation of the aorta) or preload \\n(volume overload, such as in ventricular septal defect [VSD], \\npatent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or valvular insufficiency). \\nVolume overload is the most common cause of heart failure in  \\nchildren.\\nThe age of presentation is helpful in creating the differential \\ndiagnosis (Table 145.2). In the first weeks of life, excessive \\nafterload being placed on the myocardium is most common. \\nHeart failure presenting around 2 months of age is usually \\ndue to increasing left-to-right shunts that become apparent as \\nthe pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. Acquired heart \\ndisease, such as myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, can present \\nat any age.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe newborn is dependent on right-to-left shunting at the \\nductus arteriosus for systemic blood flow. As the ductus \\narteriosus constricts, the infant becomes critically ill with signs \\nand symptoms of heart failure from excessive pulmonary blood \\nflow and obstruction of systemic blood flow. Pulses are diffusely \\nweak or absent. S2 is single and loud. There is usually no heart \\nmurmur. Cyanosis may be minimal, but low cardiac output \\ngives a grayish color to the cool, mottled skin.\\nImaging Studies\\nECG findings include right ventricular hypertrophy  with \\ndecreased left ventricular forces . The chest x-ray reveals \\ncardiomegaly (with right-sided enlargement) and pulmonary \\nvenous congestion or pulmonary edema. Echocardiography \\nshows the small left side of the heart, the degree of stenosis of \\nthe aortic and mitral valves, the hypoplastic ascending aorta, \\nand the adequacy of left-to-right atrial flow and right-to-left  \\nductal flow.\\nTreatment\\nMedical management includes prostaglandin E1 to open the \\nductus arteriosus, correction of acidosis, and ventilatory and \\nblood pressure support as needed. Surgical repair is staged \\nwith the first surgery (Norwood or Sano procedure) done during \\nthe newborn period. Subsequent procedures create a systemic \\nsource for the pulmonary circulation (bidirectional Glenn and \\nFontan procedures), leaving the right ventricle to supply systemic \\ncirculation.

When \\nthe patient’s ventricular function moves from A to B by the administration \\nof one of these agents, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure may \\nalso decrease because of improved cardiac function; further administra-\\ntion of diuretics or venodilators may shift the function further to the \\nleft along the same curve from B to C and eliminate the risk of pulmonary \\nedema. A vasodilating agent that has arteriolar and venous dilating \\nproperties (e.g., nitroprusside) would shift this function directly from \\nA to C. If this agent shifts the function from A to D because of excessive \\nvenodilation or the administration of diuretics, the cardiac output may \\ndecrease too much, even though the left ventricular end-diastolic \\npressure would be normal (10 mm Hg) for a normal heart. Left  ventricular \\nend-diastolic pressures of 15-18  mm Hg are usually optimal in the \\nfailing heart to maximize cardiac output, but to avoid pulmonary edema. \\n(From Andreoli TE, Carpenter CCJ, Griggs RC, Loscalzo J, eds. Cecil \\nEssentials of Medicine. 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2001.)\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nHeart failure presents in infants as poor feeding, failure to \\nthrive, tachypnea, and diaphoresis with feeding. Older children \\nmay present with shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and \\nedema. The physical examination findings depend on whether \\npulmonary venous congestion, systemic venous congestion, or \\nboth are present. Tachycardia, a gallop rhythm, and thready \\npulses may be present with either cause. If left-sided failure is \\npredominant, tachypnea, orthopnea, wheezing, and pulmonary \\nedema are seen. Hepatomegaly, edema, and distended neck \\nveins are signs of right-sided failure.\\nIMAGING STUDIES\\nThe absence of cardiomegaly on a chest x-ray usually rules out \\nthe diagnosis of heart failure. An echocardiogram assesses the \\nheart chamber sizes, measures myocardial function, and \\ndiagnoses congenital heart defects when present.\\nTREATMENT\\nInitial treatment is directed at improving myocardial function \\nand optimizing preload and afterload. Diuretics, inotropic \\nsupport, and, often, afterload reduction are employed (Table \\n145.3). Long-term therapy usually consists of diuretics followed \\nby afterload reduction. Long-term therapy with β-blockers \\nalso may be beneficial, although this remains somewhat \\ncontroversial in pediatric patients. Spironolactone is usually \\nadded to the medical regimen because of its effect on cardiac  \\nremodeling.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Myocardial contractility is \\nvariably decreased. Children with dilated cardiomyopathy \\npresent with signs and symptoms of inadequate cardiac output \\nand heart failure. Tachypnea and tachycardia are present on \\nexamination. Peripheral pulses are often weak because of a \\nnarrow pulse pressure. Rales may be audible on auscultation. \\nThe heart sounds may be muffled, and an S 3 is often present. \\nConcurrent infectious illness may result in circulatory collapse \\nand shock in children with dilated cardiomyopathies.\\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is initially difficult to diagnose. \\nInfants, but not older children, frequently present with signs \\nof heart failure. Sudden death may be the initial presentation \\nin older children. Dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope or \\nnear-syncope, and palpitations may be present. A murmur is \\nheard in more than 50% of children referred after identification \\nof an affected family member. Restrictive cardiomyopathies \\nare relatively rare in pediatrics. Presenting symptoms usually \\ninclude dyspnea exacerbated by a respiratory illness, syncope, \\nhepatomegaly, and an S4 heart sound on examination.\\nIMAGING STUDIES\\nCardiomegaly usually is seen on chest radiographs for all three \\ntypes of cardiomyopathies. The electrocardiogram (ECG) in \\ndilated cardiomyopathy may have nonspecific ST-T wave changes \\nand left ventricular hypertrophy. ECG evidence of right ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy is present in 25% of children with car-\\ndiomyopathy. The ECG with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is \\nuniversally abnormal, but changes are nonspecific. Primary \\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with a prolonged \\nQT interval. Children with restrictive cardiomyopathies may \\nshow atrial enlargement on the ECG. Echocardiography features \\nvary by type of cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathies result \\nin left atrial and ventricular dilation, a decreased shortening \\nfraction, and globally depressed contractility. Asymmetric septal \\nhypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction are \\nseen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Massive atrial dilation \\nis seen in restrictive cardiomyopathies.

A chest x-ray may \\nreveal cardiomegaly. A large effusion creates a rounded, globular \\ncardiac silhouette. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show \\ntachycardia, elevated ST segments, reduced QRS voltage, or \\nelectrical alternans (variable QRS amplitude).

By 2 months’ gestation, the primary \\nsite of hematopoiesis migrates to the liver. By 5-6 months’ \\ngestation, the process shifts from the liver to the bone marrow. \\nAn extremely premature infant may have significant extramedul-\\nlary hematopoiesis due to limited bone marrow hematopoiesis. \\nDuring infancy, virtually all marrow cavities are actively \\nhematopoietic and the proportion of hematopoietic to stromal \\nelements is quite high. As the child grows, hematopoiesis moves \\nto the central bones of the body (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, and \\npelvis), and the marrow is gradually replaced with fat. Hemolysis \\nor marrow damage may lead to marrow repopulation of cavities \\nwhere hematopoiesis previously had ceased or may delay the \\nshift of hematopoiesis. Hepatosplenomegaly in patients with \\nchronic hemolysis may signify extramedullary hematopoiesis. \\nWhen a patient with cytopenia is being evaluated, a bone \\nmarrow examination provides valuable information about \\nprocesses that lead to underproduction of circulating cells. In \\naddition, bone marrow infiltration by neoplastic elements or \\nstorage cells often occurs in concert with infiltration in the \\nspleen, liver, and lymph nodes.\\nThe hematopoietic cells consist of the following:\\n1. S mall compartment of pluripotent progenitor stem cells  \\nthat resemble small lymphocytes and are capable of forming \\nall myeloid elements\\n2. L arge compartment of committed, proliferating cells of \\nmyeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineage\\n3. L arge compartment of postmitotic maturing cells (Fig. 149.1)\\nThe bone marrow is the major storage organ for mature \\nneutrophils and contains about seven times the intravascular \\npool of neutrophils. It contains 2.5-5 times as many cells of \\nmyeloid lineage as cells of erythroid lineage. Smaller numbers \\nof megakaryocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and \\nstromal cells are also stored in the marrow.\\nErythropoiesis (red blood cell [RBC] production) is \\ncontrolled by erythropoietin, a glycoprotein that stimulates \\nprimitive pluripotential stem cells to differentiate along the \\nerythroid line. It is made by the juxtaglomerular apparatus of \\nthe kidney in response to local tissue hypoxia.

Acute episodes of \\nanemia may be life threatening, presenting with impairment \\nof perfusion and cognitive status. The two most common \\nfindings of anemia include pallor and jaundice. The presence \\nof petechiae, purpura, or deeper sites of bleeding, including \\ngeneralized hemorrhage, indicates abnormalities of platelets, \\ncoagulation factors, or both.

Platelets form by invagination of the megakaryocytic \\ncell membrane and bud off from the periphery. Thrombopoietin \\nis the primary regulator of platelet production. Platelets adhere \\nto damaged endothelium and subendothelial surfaces via specific \\nreceptors for the adhesive proteins, von Willebrand factor \\n(VWF), and fibrinogen. Platelets also have specific granules \\nthat readily release their contents after stimulation and trigger \\nthe process of platelet aggregation. Platelets circulate for 7-10 \\ndays and have no nucleus.\\nLymphocytes are particularly abundant in the bone marrow \\nof young children. These are primarily B lymphocytes arising in \\nthe spleen and lymph nodes, but T lymphocytes also are present.\\nCHAPTER 150 \\nAnemia\\nETIOLOGY\\nThe diagnosis of anemia is determined by comparison of the \\npatient’s hemoglobin level with age-specific and sex-specific \\nnormal values (see Table 149.2). The production of androgens \\nat the onset of puberty in boys causes males to maintain a \\nnormal hemoglobin value approximately 1.5-2 g/dL hig her than \\ngirls. The easiest quantitative definition of anemia is any \\nhemoglobin or hematocrit value that is 2 standard deviations \\n(SDs; 95% confidence limits) below the mean for age and gender. \\nHowever, in certain pathological states, anemia may be present \\nwith a normal hemoglobin level (e.g., cyanotic cardiac or \\npulmonary disease or abnormally high hemoglobin affinity for \\noxygen). This is a physiological definition of anemia. Anemia \\nis often a manifestation of another other primary process and \\nmay accentuate other organ dysfunction.\\nAnemias are classified based on the size and hemoglobin \\ncontent of the cells (Fig. 150.1). Hypochromic, microcytic \\nanemia is caused by an inadequate production of hemoglobin. \\nThe most common causes of this type of anemia are iron defi-\\nciency and thalassemia. Most normocytic anemias are associated \\nwith a systemic illness that impairs adequate marrow synthesis \\nof red blood cells (RBCs). Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies \\nlead to macrocytic anemia. Hemolytic diseases are mediated \\neither by disorders intrinsic or extrinsic to the RBC that increase \\ncell destruction. The most common RBC membrane disorders \\nare hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis. \\nIn both of these disorders, abnormalities of proteins within \\nthe cytoskeleton lead to abnormal RBC shape and function. \\nNumerous RBC enzyme deficiencies may lead to hemolysis, \\nbut only two are common: glucose-6-phosphate dehydro-\\ngenase (G6PD) deficiency  and pyruvate kinase deficiency . \\nImmune-mediated hemolysis may be extravascular when RBCs \\ncoated with antibodies or complement are phagocytosed by the \\nreticuloendothelial system. The hemolysis may be intravascular \\nwhen antibody binding leads to complement fixation and lysis \\nof RBCs.\\nproduction in the liver in response to low partial pressure of \\noxygen (PO2) in utero. Erythropoietin leads to production of \\nthe erythroid colony-forming unit. The earliest recognizable \\nerythroid cell is the erythroblast, which forms eight or more \\ndaughter cells. The RBC nucleus becomes gradually pyknotic \\nand eventually is extruded. The cell is then released from the \\nmarrow as a reticulocyte that maintains residual mitochondrial \\nand protein synthetic capacity. These highly specialized RBC \\nprecursors are engaged primarily in the production of globin \\nchains, glycolytic enzymes, and heme. Iron is taken up via \\ntransferrin receptors and incorporated into the heme ring, which \\ncombines with globin chains synthesized within the immature \\nRBC. When the messenger RNA and mitochondria are gone \\nfrom the RBC, heme or protein synthesis is no longer possible; \\nhowever, the RBC continues to function for its normal life span \\nof about 120 days.\\nEmbryonic hemoglobins are produced during yolk sac \\nerythropoiesis, then replaced by fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin \\nF,  α2γ2) during the hepatic phase. During the third trimester, \\ngamma chain production gradually diminishes, replaced by beta \\nchains, resulting in hemoglobin A (α2β2). Some fetal factors \\n(e.g., infant of a diabetic mother) delay onset of beta chain \\nproduction, but premature birth does not. Just after birth, with \\nrapid increases in oxygen saturation, erythropoietin production \\nstops and thus erythropoiesis ceases. Fetal RBCs have a shorter \\nsurvival time (60 days).\\nDuring the first few months of postnatal life, rapid growth, \\nshortened RBC survival, and cessation of erythropoiesis cause \\na gradual decline in hemoglobin levels, with a nadir at 8-10 \\nweeks of life. This so-called physiological nadir is accentuated \\nin premature infants. Erythropoietin is produced in response \\nto the decline in hemoglobin and decreased oxygen delivery. \\nErythropoiesis subsequently resumes with an increase in the \\nreticulocyte count. The hemoglobin level gradually increases, \\naccompanied by synthesis of increasing amounts of hemoglobin \\nA. By 6 months of age in healthy infants, only trace gamma \\nchain synthesis occurs.\\nProduction of neutrophil precursors is controlled pre -\\ndominantly by two different colony-stimulating factors (see \\nFig. 149.1). The most immature neutrophil precursors are \\ncontrolled by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating \\nfactor (GM-CSF), produced by monocytes and lymphocytes. \\nGM-CSF increases the entry of primitive precursor cells into \\nthe myeloid line of differentiation. Granulocyte colony-\\nstimulating factor (G-CSF) augments the production of more \\nmature granulocyte precursors. GM-CSF and G-CSF , working \\nin concert, can augment production of neutrophils, shorten the \\nusual 10- to 14-day production time from stem cell to mature \\nneutrophil, and stimulate functional activity. The rapid increase \\nin neutrophil count that occurs with infection is caused by \\nrelease of stored neutrophils from the bone marrow, under \\nthe control of GM-CSF . During maturation, a mitotic pool of \\nneutrophil precursors exists—myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and \\nmyelocytes possessing primary granules. The postmitotic pool \\nconsists of metamyelocytes, bands, and mature polymorpho-\\nnuclear leukocytes containing secondary or specific granules \\nthat define the cell type. Only bands and mature neutrophils \\nare fully functional with regard to phagocytosis, chemotaxis, \\nand bacterial killing. Neutrophils migrate from the bone \\nmarrow, circulate for 6-7 hours, and enter the tissues, where \\nthey become end-stage cells that do not recirculate. Eosinophil \\nproduction is under the control of a related glycoprotein \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In later childhood and adolescence, the presence \\nof constitutional symptoms, unusual diets, drug ingestion, or \\nblood loss, especially from menstrual bleeding, often points to a \\ndiagnosis. Congenital hemolytic disorders (enzyme deficiencies \\nand membrane problems) often present in the first 6 months \\nof life and frequently are associated with neonatal jaundice, \\nalthough these disorders often go undiagnosed. A careful \\ndrug history is essential for detecting problems that may be \\ndrug induced. Pure dietary iron deficiency is rare except in \\nchildren’s ages 1-3 years when cow’s milk protein intolerance \\ncauses gastrointestinal blood loss and further complicates an \\nalready inadequate iron intake.\\nThe physical examination may point to the potential causes \\n(see Table 150.2). The physiological stability  of the patient \\nmay be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, \\nmanifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most \\nominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of \\njaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate \\na coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest \\ninfiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests \\nanemia of inflammation (previously termed anemia of chronic \\ndisease). An essential element of the physical examination is \\nthe investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood.\\nLABORATORY STUDIES\\nA hemoglobin or hematocrit test indicates the severity of the \\nanemia. After anemia has been substantiated, the work-up should \\ninclude a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, \\nindices, and reticulocyte count. Examination of the peripheral \\nblood smear assesses the morphology of RBCs (Fig. 150.2), \\nwhite blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. All cell lines should be \\nscrutinized to determine whether anemia is the result of a process \\nlimited to the erythroid line or a process that affects other marrow \\nelements. Using data obtained from the indices and reticulocyte \\ncount, the work-up can be organized on the basis of whether RBC \\nproduction is adequate or inadequate and whether the cells are \\nmicrocytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (see Fig. 150.1).\\nAn appropriate bone marrow response to anemia includes an \\nelevated absolute reticulocyte number, suggesting increased RBC \\nproduction. This implies either hemolysis or blood loss. Anemia \\nwith a normal reticulocyte number suggests decreased or inef-\\nfective production for the degree of anemia. Reticulocytopenia \\nsignifies either an acute onset of anemia such that the marrow \\nhas not had adequate time to respond; that reticulocytes are \\nbeing destroyed in the marrow (antibody mediated); or that \\nintrinsic bone marrow disease is present. The best indicators \\nof the severity of hemolysis are the hemoglobin level and the \\nelevation of the reticulocyte count. Biochemical evidence of \\nhemolysis includes an increase in levels of bilirubin and lactate \\ndehydrogenase and a decrease in haptoglobin.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nHypochromic, Microcytic Anemia\\nIron Deficiency Anemia\\nTABLE 150.1 Historical Clues in Evaluation of Anemia\\nVARIABLE COMMENTS\\nAge Iron deficiency rare in the absence of blood \\nloss before 6 mo or in term infants or before \\ndoubling of birth weight in preterm infants\\nNeonatal anemia with reticulocytosis suggests \\nhemolysis or blood loss; with reticulocytopenia, \\nsuggests bone marrow failure\\nSickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia appear as \\nfetal hemoglobin disappears (4-8  mo of age)\\nFamily history \\nand genetic \\nconsiderations\\nX-linked: G6PD deficiency\\nAutosomal dominant: spherocytosis\\nAutosomal recessive: sickle cell anemia, \\nFanconi anemia\\nFamily member with history of cholecystectomy \\n(for bilirubin stones) or splenectomy at an early \\nage\\nEthnicity (thalassemia in persons of \\nMediterranean origin; G6PD deficiency in \\nblacks, Greeks, and people of Middle Eastern \\norigin)\\nRace (β-thalassemia in persons of \\nMediterranean, African, or Asian descent; \\nα-thalassemia in those of African and Asian \\ndescent; SC and SS in those of African descent)\\nNutrition Cow’s milk diet: iron deficiency\\nStrict vegetarian: vitamin B 12 deficiency\\nGoat’s milk diet: folate deficiency\\nPica: plumbism, iron deficiency\\nCholestasis, malabsorption: vitamin E deficiency\\nDrugs G6PD: oxidants (e.g., nitrofurantoin, \\nantimalarials)\\nImmune-mediated hemolysis (e.g., penicillin)\\nBone marrow suppression (e.g., chemotherapy)\\nPhenytoin, increasing folate requirements\\nDiarrhea Malabsorption of vitamin B 12 or E or iron\\nInflammatory bowel disease and anemia of \\ninflammation (chronic disease) with or without \\nblood loss\\nMilk protein intolerance–induced blood loss\\nIntestinal resection: vitamin B12 deficiency\\nInfection Giardia lamblia infection: iron malabsorption\\nIntestinal bacterial overgrowth (blind loop): \\nvitamin B12 deficiency\\nFish tapeworm: vitamin B 12 deficiency\\nEpstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus infection: \\nbone marrow suppression, hemophagocytic \\nsyndromes\\nMycoplasma infection: hemolysis\\nParvovirus infection: bone marrow suppression\\nHIV infection\\nChronic infection\\nEndocarditis\\nMalaria: hemolysis\\nHepatitis: aplastic anemia\\nG6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAnemia\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Iron deficiency \\nin infancy may be associated with later cognitive deficits and \\npoor school performance.\\nEtiology\\nInfants fed cow’s milk when younger than 1 year of age, toddlers \\nfed large volumes of cow’s milk, and menstruating adolescent \\nfemales who are not receiving supplemental iron are at high \\nrisk for iron deficiency. Dietary iron deficiency anemia is most \\ncommon in bottle-fed toddlers who are receiving large volumes \\nof cow’s milk and eat minimal amounts of food high in iron \\ncontent (see Chapters 28 and 31). Iron deficiency anemia also \\nmay be found in children with chronic inflammatory diseases, \\neven without chronic blood loss.\\nEpidemiology\\nThe prevalence of iron deficiency, the most common cause of \\nanemia in the world, is approximately 9% in toddlers, 9-11% \\nin adolescent females, and less than 1% in adolescent males. \\nIron deficiency anemia occurs in approximately one third of \\nchildren who are iron deficient (Table 150.3).

The RBC count is usually elevated. As a result, if \\nthe mean corpuscular volume (MCV) divided by the RBC count \\nis less than 12.5 (Mentzer index), the diagnosis is suggestive \\nof thalassemia trait. The blood smear reveals only microcytosis \\nwith α-thalassemia minor. Outside the neonatal period, when \\nBart hemoglobin is no longer detectable, the hemoglobin \\nelectrophoresis is usually normal in α-thalassemia minor (see \\nFig. 150.3). Blood smears of patients with β-thalassemia minor \\nalso reveal microcytic RBCs. In addition, target cells and \\nbasophilic stippled RBCs, caused by precipitation of alpha-chain \\ntetramers, may also be present. The diagnosis of β-thalassemia \\nminor is based on an elevation of hemoglobin A2 and F levels. \\nMolecular testing is indicated for identification of more severe \\nor unusual variants.\\nTreatment\\nNo treatment is required for children with thalassemia minor. \\nHowever, children with more severe forms of thalassemia, such \\nas β-thalassemia intermedia or major or children with hemo-\\nglobin H disease (β4 tetramers), especially the Constant Spring \\nvariant, require chronic transfusion therapy (see Table 150.5).\\nLead Poisoning\\nLead poisoning may be associated with a hypochromic, micro-\\ncytic anemia because most patients have concomitant iron \\ndeficiency. The history of living in an older home (built before \\n1980) with chipped paint or lead dust should raise suspicion \\nof lead poisoning, especially in a child with pica. The lead \\ncontent of water should also be assessed due to the potential \\nfor lead containing pipes. Basophilic stippling on the blood \\nsmear is common. Lead intoxication rarely causes hemolytic \\nanemia. Detection by routine screening, removal from exposure, \\nchelation therapy, and correction of iron deficiency are crucial \\nto the potential development of affected children.\\nNormocytic Anemia\\nEtiology and Treatment\\nAnemia is a common component of chronic inflammatory \\ndisease. Hepcidin, a protein made in the liver, plays a key role \\nin iron homeostasis. Inflammation causes an increase in the \\nTreatment\\nIn an otherwise healthy child, a therapeutic trial of oral iron \\nis the best diagnostic study for iron deficiency as long as the \\nchild is re-examined and a response is documented. The response \\nto oral iron includes rapid subjective improvement, especially \\nin neurological function (within 24-48 hours) and reticulocytosis \\n(48-72 hours); increase in hemoglobin levels (4-30 days); and \\nrepletion of iron stores (in 1-3 months). The usual therapeutic \\ndose of 4-6  m g/day of elemental iron induces an increase in \\nhemoglobin of 0.25-0.4  g/dL p er day (a 1%/day increase in \\nhematocrit). If the hemoglobin level fails to increase within 2 \\nweeks after institution of iron treatment, careful re-evaluation \\nfor ongoing blood loss, development of infection, poor compli-\\nance, malabsorption, or other causes of microcytic anemia is \\nrequired (Table 150.4; see Fig. 150.1).\\nPrevention\\nBottle-fed infants should receive an iron-containing formula \\nuntil 12 months of age. Exclusively breast-fed infants older \\nthan 6 months of age should receive an iron supplement. The \\nintroduction of iron-enriched solid foods at 6 months of age, \\nfollowed by a transition to a limited amount of cow’s milk and \\nincreased solid foods at 1 year, can help prevent iron deficiency \\nanemia. Adolescent females who are menstruating should have \\na diet enriched with iron-containing foods. A vitamin with \\niron may also be used.\\nThalassemia Minor\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nα-Thalassemia and β-thalassemia minor are common causes \\nof microcytosis, either with or without a mild hypochromic, \\nmicrocytic anemia. They are prevalent in certain ethnic groups \\n(Mediterranean, Southeast Asian, African Americans). Individu-\\nals of Asian descent are at risk of having three or four α genes \\ndeleted, resulting in hemoglobin disease ( β4 tetramers) or \\nhydrops fetalis, which is largely Bart (γ4 tetramers) hemoglobin \\n(Table 150.5 and Fig. 150.3).\\nLaboratory Testing\\nThe thalassemia minor syndromes (i.e., α-thalassemia trait, \\nβ-thalassemia trait) are characterized by a mild hypochromic, \\nTABLE 150.4 Differentiating Features of Microcytic Anemias*\\nTEST IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA THALASSEMIA MINOR† ANEMIA OF INFLAMMATION‡\\nSerum iron Low Normal Low\\nSerum iron-binding capacity High Normal Low or normal\\nSerum ferritin Low Normal or high Normal or high\\nMarrow iron stores Low or absent Normal or high Normal or high\\nMarrow sideroblasts Decreased or absent Normal or increased Normal or increased\\nFree erythrocyte protoporphyrin High Normal or slightly increased High\\nHemoglobin A2 or F Normal High β-thalassemia; normal \\nα-thalassemia\\nNormal\\nRed blood cell distribution \\nwidth§\\nHigh Normal Normal/↑\\n*See Table 150.3 for definition of microcytosis.\\n†α-Thalassemia minor can be diagnosed by the presence of Bart hemoglobin on newborn screening.\\n‡Usually normochromic; 25% of cases are microcytic.\\n§Red blood cell distribution width quantitates the degree of anisocytosis (different sizes) of red blood cells.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

When HSCT occurs before the recipient \\nis sensitized to blood products, survival rate is greater than \\n80%. The treatment of aplastic anemia without an HLA-matched \\ndonor for HSCT is evolving, with two major options: potent \\nimmunosuppressive therapy or unrelated or partially matched \\nHSCT.

Causes of \\npancytopenia include failure of production (implying intrinsic \\nbone marrow disease), sequestration (hypersplenism), and \\nincreased peripheral destruction.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nFeatures that suggest bone marrow failure  and mandate an \\nexamination of bone marrow include a low reticulocyte count, \\nteardrop forms of RBCs (implying marrow replacement, not \\njust failure), presence of abnormal forms of leukocytes or \\nmyeloid elements less mature than band forms, small plate-\\nlets, and an elevated MCV in the face of a low reticulocyte \\ncount. Pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure is \\nusually a gradual process, starting with one or two cell lines \\nbut later involving all three cell lines. Features suggesting \\nincreased destruction include reticulocytosis, jaundice, \\nimmature erythroid or myeloid elements on the blood smear, \\nlarge platelets, and increased serum bilirubin and lactic  \\ndehydrogenase.\\nAplastic Anemia\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nIn a child with aplastic anemia, pancytopenia evolves as the \\nhematopoietic elements of the bone marrow disappear and the \\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nFanconi anemia is a constitutional form of aplastic anemia \\nthat usually presents in the latter half of the first decade of \\nlife and may evolve over years. A group of genetic defects \\nin proteins involved in DNA repair have been identified in \\nFanconi anemia, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive \\nmanner. The diagnosis is based on demonstration of increased \\nchromosomal breakage after exposure to agents that damage \\nDNA. The repair mechanism for DNA damage is abnormal \\nin all cells in Fanconi anemia, which may contribute to the \\nincreased risk of malignancies. Acute leukemia develops in \\n10% of cases. Other malignancies that can occur include solid \\ntumors of the head and neck, gastrointestinal tumors, and  \\ngynecological tumors.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nPatients with Fanconi anemia have numerous characteristic \\nclinical findings (see Table 150.6).\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In the Asian \\npopulation, deletions may occur on the same chromosome \\n(cis). Thus infants born to parents who both have α-thalassemia \\ngene deletions in cis may inherit two number 16 chromosomes \\nlacking three or even four genes resulting in severe disease. \\nDeletion of all four α genes leads to hydrops fetalis, severe \\nintrauterine anemia, and death, unless intrauterine transfusions \\nare administered. Deletion of three genes produces moderate \\nhemolytic anemia with γ4 tetramers (Bart hemoglobin) in the \\nfetus and β4 tetramers (hemoglobin H) in older children and \\nadults (see Table 150.5).\\nBeta-Chain Hemoglobinopathies\\nBeta-chain hemoglobinopathies in the United States are \\nmore prevalent than alpha-chain disorders, possibly because \\nthese abnormalities are not symptomatic in utero. The major \\nbeta hemoglobinopathies include those that alter hemoglobin \\nfunction, including hemoglobins S, C, E, and D, and those that \\nalter beta-chain production, the β-thalassemias. Because each \\nRBC has two copies of chromosome 11 and they express both \\nβ-globin genes, most disorders of beta chains are not clinically \\nsevere, unless both beta chains are abnormal. By convention, \\nwhen describing β-thalassemia genes, β 0 indicates a thalas -\\nsemic gene resulting in absent beta-chain synthesis, whereas \\nβ+ indicates a thalassemic gene that permits reduced but not \\nabsent synthesis of normal β chains. Disorders of the beta chain \\nusually manifest themselves clinically between 4 and 12 months \\nof age when fetal hemoglobin nadirs, unless they have been \\ndetected prenatally or by cord blood screening.\\nβ-Thalassemia Major (Cooley Anemia)\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nβ-Thalassemia major is caused by mutations that impair beta-\\nchain synthesis. Because of unbalanced synthesis of alpha and \\nbeta chains, alpha chains precipitate within the cells, resulting \\nin RBC destruction either in the bone marrow or in the spleen. \\nβ-Thalassemia major is seen most commonly in individuals of \\nMediterranean or Asian descent. The clinical severity of the \\nillness varies on the basis of the molecular defect (Table 150.5).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nSigns and symptoms of β-thalassemia major result from the \\ncombination of chronic hemolytic disease, decreased or absent \\nproduction of normal hemoglobin A, and ineffective erythro-\\npoiesis. The anemia is severe and leads to growth failure and \\nhigh-output heart failure. Ineffective erythropoiesis causes \\nincreased expenditure of energy and expansion of the bone \\nmarrow cavities of all bones, leading to osteopenia, pathological \\nfractures, extramedullary erythropoiesis with resultant hepato-\\nsplenomegaly, and an increase in the rate of iron absorption.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of β-thalassemia major is based on a hypertransfu-\\nsion program  that corrects the anemia and suppresses the \\npatient’s own ineffective erythropoiesis, limiting the stimulus \\nfor increased iron absorption. This suppression permits the \\nbones to heal, decreases metabolic expenditures, increases \\ngrowth, and limits dietary iron absorption. Splenectomy may \\nreduce the transfusion volume, but it adds to the risk of serious \\ninfection. Chelation therapy with deferoxamine or deferasirox \\nshould start when laboratory evidence of iron overload (hemo-\\nchromatosis) is present and before there are clinical signs of \\nTreatment\\nHSCT can cure the pancytopenia caused by bone marrow \\naplasia. Many patients with Fanconi anemia and approximately \\n20% of children with aplastic anemia seem to respond for a \\ntime to androgenic therapy, which induces masculinization \\nand may cause liver injury and liver tumors. Androgenic therapy \\nincreases RBC synthesis and may diminish transfusion require-\\nments. The effect on granulocytes, and especially the platelet \\ncount, is less impressive.\\nOther less common etiologies of familial bone marrow failure \\nresulting in pancytopenia are outlined in Table 150.6. These \\ninclude dyskeratosis congenita and familial hemophagocytic \\nlymphohistiocytosis.\\nMarrow Replacement\\nMarrow replacement may occur as a result of leukemia, solid \\ntumors (especially neuroblastoma), storage diseases, osteo-\\npetrosis in infants, and myelofibrosis, which is rare in child -\\nhood. The mechanisms by which malignant cells impair marrow \\nsynthesis of normal hematopoietic elements are complex and \\nincompletely understood. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy \\nare needed for precise diagnosis of the etiology of marrow \\nsynthetic failure.\\nPancytopenia Resulting From Destruction of Cells\\nPancytopenia resulting from destruction of cells may be caused \\nby intramedullary destruction  of hematopoietic elements \\n(myeloproliferative disorders, deficiencies of folic acid and \\nvitamin B12) or by the peripheral destruction of mature cells. \\nThe usual site of peripheral destruction of blood cells is the \\nspleen, although the liver and other parts of the reticuloendo-\\nthelial system may contribute. Hypersplenism may be the result \\nof anatomical causes (portal hypertension or splenic hypertrophy \\nfrom thalassemia); infections (including malaria); storage \\ndiseases (Gaucher disease); or malignancy (lymphomas, his-\\ntiocytosis).

In two different clinical situations, an \\nacute, potentially life-threatening decline in the hemoglobin \\nlevel may be superimposed on the chronic compensated anemia. \\nSplenic sequestration crisis is a life-threatening, hyperacute \\ndrop in the hemoglobin level (blood volume) secondary to \\nsplenic pooling of the patient’s RBCs and sickling within the \\nspleen. The spleen is moderately to markedly enlarged, and the \\nreticulocyte count is elevated. In an aplastic crisis, parvovirus \\nB19 infects RBC precursors in the bone marrow and induces \\ntransient RBC aplasia with reticulocytopenia and a rapid worsen-\\ning of anemia because of the very short life span of sickle RBCs. \\nSimple transfusion therapy is indicated for sequestration and \\naplastic crises when the anemia is symptomatic.\\nVasoocclusive painful events may occur in any organ of \\nthe body and manifest as pain and/or significant dysfunction \\n(see Table 150.8). The acute chest syndrome is a vasoocclusive \\niron overload (nonimmune diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, heart \\nfailure, bronzing of the skin, and multiple endocrine abnormali-\\nties). HSCT in childhood, before organ dysfunction induced \\nby iron overload, has had a high success rate in β-thalassemia \\nmajor and is the treatment of choice.\\nSickle Cell Disease\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nJaundice\\nHepatomegaly\\nSplenomegaly\\nAnemia\\nPancytopenia\\nFever Without a Source\\nIrritable Infant\\nFrom Andreoli T, Carpenter C, Griggs R, et  al.

Incentive spirometry may help \\nreduce the incidence of acute chest crisis in patients presenting \\nwith pain in the chest or abdomen.\\nAcute painful events are the most common type of vasooc-\\nclusive events. Pain usually localizes to the long bones of the \\narms or legs but may occur in smaller bones of the hands or \\nfeet in infancy (dactylitis) or in the abdomen. Painful events \\nusually last 2-7 days. Repeated painful events within the femur \\nmay lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head and chronic \\nhip disease. Treatment of painful events includes administration \\nof fluids, analgesia (usually opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflam-\\nmatory drugs), and oxygen if the patient is hypoxic. Appropriate \\nuse of analgesics is imperative to control pain. Patients with \\nsickle cell disease often require high doses of opioids due to \\ntolerance to provide adequate pain control. The frequency of \\nacute painful events increases with age. In addition, chronic daily \\npain irrespective of an acute vasoocclusive event is associated \\nwith increasing age, occurring in 30% of adults and 23-40% of \\nchildren. Chronic nervous system sensitization is likely a key \\ndriver of the chronic pain seen in patients with sickle cell disease.\\nPriapism occurs in males, usually between 6 and 20 years old. \\nThe child experiences a sudden, painful onset of a tumescent \\npenis that will not relax. Therapeutic steps for priapism include \\nthe administration of oxygen, fluids, analgesia, and transfusion \\nwhen appropriate to achieve a hemoglobin S less than 30%. \\nUrgent partial exchange transfusion is often required to lower \\nthe hemoglobin S.\\nOvert stroke occurs in approximately 8-10% of patients with \\nSS disease.

A significant change in school performance \\nor behavior has been associated with silent stroke. Children \\nwith Hg SS disease older than 3 years should be screened for \\nincreased risk of stroke using transcranial Doppler (TCD). \\nChronic monthly transfusions are indicated in those with overt \\nstroke and abnormal TCDs and should be considered for those \\nwith silent strokes.\\nLaboratory Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies is made by identifying \\nthe precise amount and type of hemoglobin using hemoglobin \\nelectrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, or high-performance \\nliquid chromatography.

These are areas of absent hemoglobin that are \\nproduced by phagocytosis of Heinz bodies by splenic mac -\\nrophages; as a result, the RBCs appear blistered. Clinically \\nevident jaundice, dark urine resulting from bilirubin pig-\\nments, hemoglobinuria when hemolysis is intravascular, and \\ndecreased haptoglobin levels are common during hemolytic \\nepisodes. Early on, the hemolysis usually exceeds the ability \\nof the bone marrow to compensate, so the reticulocyte count  \\nmay be low for 3-4 days.\\nLaboratory Studies\\nThe diagnosis of G6PD deficiency is based on decreased NADPH \\nformation. However, G6PD levels during an acute, severe \\nhemolytic episode may be normal because the most deficient \\ncells have been destroyed and reticulocytes are enriched with \\nG6PD. Repeating the test at a later time when the patient is in \\na steady-state condition, testing the mothers of boys with \\nsuspected G6PD deficiency, or performing electrophoresis to \\nidentify the precise variant present aids in diagnosis.\\nTreatment and Prevention\\nThe treatment of G6PD deficiency is supportive. Transfusions \\nare indicated when significant cardiovascular compromise is \\npresent. Maintaining hydration and urine alkalization protects \\nthe kidneys against damage from precipitated free hemoglobin. \\nHemolysis is prevented by avoidance of known oxidants, \\nparticularly long-acting sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, prima-\\nquine, dimercaprol, and moth balls (naphthalene). Fava beans \\n(favism) have triggered hemolysis, particularly in patients with \\nthe Mediterranean variant. Serious infection also is a potential \\nprecipitant of hemolysis in G6PD-deficient young children.\\nPyruvate kinase deficiency  is much less common than \\nG6PD deficiency and represents a clinical spectrum of disorders \\ncaused by the functional deficiency of pyruvate kinase. Some \\nindividuals have a true deficiency state, and others have abnor-\\nmal enzyme kinetics. The metabolic consequence of pyruvate \\nkinase deficiency is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, \\nimpairing RBC survival. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is usually \\nan autosomal disorder, and most children who are affected (and \\nare not products of consanguinity) are double heterozygotes for \\ntwo abnormal enzymes. Hemolysis is not aggravated by oxidant \\nstress due to the profound reticulocytosis in this condition. \\nAplastic crises are potentially life threatening. The spleen is \\nthe site for RBC removal in pyruvate kinase deficiency. Most \\npatients have amelioration of the anemia and a reduction of \\ntransfusion requirements after splenectomy.\\nMembrane Disorders\\nchest syndrome and need for transfusions in children as early \\nas 1 year of age. Current published clinical care guidelines from \\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Heart, Lung, \\nand Blood Institute (NHLBI) for patients with sickle cell disease \\nrecommend hydroxyurea should be initiated in asymptomatic \\nchildren with severe sickle cell disease (HbSS or HbSβ0-\\nthalassemia). HSCT using a matched sibling donor has cured \\nmany children with sickle cell disease.

When a \\npatient with G6PD is exposed to significant oxidant stress, \\nhemoglobin is oxidized, forming precipitates of sulfhemoglobin \\n(Heinz bodies), which are visible on specially stained prepara-\\ntions. The gene for G6PD deficiency is on the X chromosome.\\nThe severity of hemolysis depends on the enzyme variant. \\nIn many G6PD variants the enzymes become unstable with \\naging of the RBC and cannot be replaced because the cell is \\nanucleated. Older cells are most susceptible to oxidant-induced \\nhemolysis. In other variants the enzyme is kinetically abnormal.\\nEpidemiology\\nThe most common variants of G6PD deficiency have been \\nfound in areas where malaria is endemic. G6PD deficiency \\nprotects against parasitism of the erythrocyte. The most common \\nvariant with normal activity is termed type B and is defined by \\nits electrophoretic mobility. The approximate gene frequencies \\nin African Americans are 70% type B, 20% type A, and 10% \\ntype A–. Only the A– variant, termed the African variant,  \\nis unstable. Ten percent of black males are affected. A group \\nof variants found in Sardinians, Sicilians, Greeks, Sephardic \\nand Oriental Jews, and Arabs is termed the Mediterranean \\nvariant and is associated with chronic hemolysis and poten -\\ntially life-threatening hemolytic disease. Because the gene for \\nG6PD deficiency is carried on the X chromosome, clinical \\nhemolysis is most common in males. Heterozygous females \\nwho have randomly inactivated a higher percentage of the \\nnormal gene may become symptomatic, as may homozygous \\nfemales with the A– variant (0.5-1% of females of African  \\ndescent).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nG6PD deficiency has two common presentations. Individuals \\nwith the A– variant have normal hemoglobin values when \\nwell but develop an acute episode of hemolysis triggered \\nby serious (bacterial) infection or ingestion of an oxidant \\ndrug.

Splenectomy should be \\nreserved for any child with severe hereditary spherocytosis and \\nsymptoms referable to chronic anemia or growth failure. \\nSplenectomy should be deferred until age 5 years, if possible, \\nto minimize the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis \\nand to maximize the antibody response to the polyvalent \\npneumococcal and meningococcal vaccine.

The transmission of the two \\nvariants is usually autosomal dominant, but spontaneous \\nmutations causing hereditary spherocytosis are common. \\nHereditary pyropoikilocytosis (unusual instability of the \\nerythrocytes when they are exposed to heat at 45°C) is the \\nresult of a structural abnormality of spectrin.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nHereditary spherocytosis varies greatly in clinical severity, \\nranging from an asymptomatic, well-compensated, mild \\nhemolytic anemia that may be discovered incidentally to a \\nsevere hemolytic anemia with growth failure, splenomegaly, \\nand chronic transfusion requirements in infancy necessitating \\nearly splenectomy. The most common variant of hereditary \\nelliptocytosis is a clinically insignificant morphological abnor-\\nmality without shortened RBC survival. The less common variant \\nis associated with spherocytes, ovalocytes, and elliptocytes with \\na moderate, usually compensated, hemolysis. Far more significant \\nhemolysis occurs in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. The peripheral \\nblood smear in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis often includes \\nelliptocytes, spherocytes, fragmented RBCs, and striking \\nmicrocytosis. Such patients may have bizarre blood smears in \\nthe newborn period with small, fragmented RBCs.\\nLaboratory Diagnosis\\nThe clinical diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis should be \\nsuspected in patients with even a few spherocytes found on \\nthe blood smear because the spleen preferentially removes \\nspherocytes.

In addition to \\ntransfusion, which may be lifesaving, management of auto-\\nimmune hemolytic anemia depends on antibody type. Manage-\\nment may involve administration of corticosteroids and, at \\ntimes, intravenous immunoglobulin. Corticosteroids reduce \\nthe clearance of sensitized RBCs in the spleen. In drug-induced \\nhemolysis, withdrawal of the drug usually leads to resolution \\nof the hemolytic process. More than 80% of children with \\nautoimmune hemolytic anemia recover spontaneously.\\nCHAPTER 151 \\nHemostatic Disorders\\nNORMAL HEMOSTASIS\\nHemostasis is the dynamic process of coagulation as it occurs \\nin areas of vascular injury, involving the carefully modulated \\ninteraction of platelets, vascular wall, and procoagulant and \\nanticoagulant proteins. After an injury to the vascular endothe-\\nlium, subendothelial collagen induces a conformational change \\nin von Willebrand factor (VWF), an adhesive protein to which \\nplatelets bind via their glycoprotein Ib receptor. After adhesion, \\nplatelets undergo activation and release numerous intracel-\\nlular contents, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP). These \\nactivated platelets subsequently induce aggregation of additional \\nplatelets. Simultaneously, tissue factor, collagen, and other matrix \\nproteins in tissue activate the coagulation cascade, leading to the \\nformation of the enzyme thrombin (Fig. 151.1). Thrombin causes \\nfurther aggregation of platelets, a positive feedback activation \\nof factors 5 and 8, the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and \\nthe activation of factor 11. A platelet plug forms, and bleeding \\nceases, usually within 3-7 minutes. The generation of thrombin \\nleads to formation of a permanent clot by the activation of factor \\n13, which cross links fibrin, forming a stable thrombus. Finally, \\ncontractile elements within the platelet mediate clot retraction. \\nThrombin also contributes to the eventual limitation of clot size \\nby binding to the protein thrombomodulin on intact endothelial \\ncells, converting protein C into activated protein C. Thrombin \\ncontributes to the eventual lysis of the thrombus by activating \\nplasminogen to plasmin. All of the hemostatic processes are \\nclosely interwoven and occur on biological surfaces that mediate \\ncoagulation by bringing the critical players—platelets, endothelial \\ncells, and subendothelium—into close proximity with pro- and \\nanticoagulant proteins.\\nMany think of coagulation as having intrinsic and extrinsic \\npathways, but the reality is that these pathways are closely \\ninteractive and do not react independently (Fig. 151.2). For ease \\nof use, all coagulation factors are denoted using Arabic rather \\nthan Roman numerals to prevent misreading factor VII (7) as \\nimmature erythroid precursors (erythroblastosis) on the infant’s \\nblood smear confirm this diagnosis. Isoimmune hemolytic \\ndisease varies in clinical severity. There may be no clinical \\nmanifestations or the infant may exhibit jaundice, severe anemia, \\nand hydrops fetalis.\\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia is usually an acute, self-\\nlimited Coombs-positive process that develops after an infection \\n(Mycoplasma, Epstein-Barr, or other viral infections) due to the \\nproduction of autoantibodies that cause red cell destruction. \\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia may also be the presenting \\nsymptom of a chronic autoimmune disease (systemic lupus \\nerythematosus, lymphoproliferative disorders, or immunodefi-\\nciency). Drugs may induce a Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia \\nby forming a hapten on the RBC membrane (penicillin) or \\nby forming immune complexes (quinidine) that attach to the \\nRBC membrane. Antibodies then activate complement-induced \\nintravascular hemolysis. The third type of drug-induced immune \\nhemolysis occurs during treatment with α-methyldopa and a \\nfew other drugs. In this type, prolonged drug exposure alters the \\nRBC membrane, inducing neoantigen formation. Antibodies are \\nproduced that bind to the neoantigen; this produces a positive \\nantiglobulin test result far more commonly than it actually \\ninduces hemolysis. In each of these conditions, the erythrocyte \\nis an innocent bystander.\\nA second form of acquired hemolytic disease is caused by \\nmechanical damage to the RBC membrane during circulation. \\nIn thrombotic microangiopathy the RBCs are trapped by fibrin \\nstrands in the circulation and physically broken by shear stress \\nas they pass through these strands. Hemolytic uremic syndrome, \\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic \\nthrombocytopenic purpura, malignant hypertension, toxemia, \\nand hyperacute renal graft rejection can produce thrombotic \\nmicroangiopathy. The platelets are usually large, indicating that \\nthey are young, but have a decreased survival even if the numbers \\nare normal. Consumption of clotting factors is more prominent \\nin DIC than in the other forms of thrombotic microangiopathy. \\nThe smear shows RBC fragments (schistocytes), microsphero-\\ncytes, teardrop forms, and polychromasia. Other examples of \\nmechanical injury to RBCs include damage by exposure to \\nnonendothelialized surfaces (as in artificial heart valves) or \\nas a result of high flow and shear rates in giant hemangiomas \\n(Kasabach-Merritt syndrome).\\nAlterations in plasma lipids, especially cholesterol, may lead \\nto damage to the RBC membrane and shorten RBC survival. \\nLipids in the plasma are in equilibrium with lipids in the RBC \\nmembrane. High cholesterol levels increase the membrane \\ncholesterol and the total membrane surface without affecting \\nthe volume of the cell. This condition produces spur cells \\nthat may be seen in abetalipoproteinemia and liver diseases. \\nHemolysis occurs in the spleen, where poor RBC deformability \\nresults in erythrocyte destruction. Circulating toxins (e.g., snake \\nvenoms and heavy metals) that bind sulfhydryl groups may \\ndamage the RBC membrane and induce hemolysis. Irregularly \\nspiculated RBCs (burr cells) are seen in renal failure. Vitamin \\nE deficiency can also cause an acquired hemolytic anemia as \\na result of abnormal sensitivity of membrane lipids to oxidant \\nstress. Vitamin E deficiency may occur in premature infants \\nwho are not being supplemented with vitamin E or who have \\ninsufficient nutrition, in infants with severe malabsorption \\nsyndromes (including cystic fibrosis), and in infants with \\ntransfusional iron overload, which can lead to severe oxidant \\nexposure.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Levels of other \\nclotting factors and anticoagulant proteins increase gradually \\nthroughout gestation. The premature infant is simultaneously \\nat increased risk of bleeding or clotting complications that are \\nexacerbated by many of the medical interventions needed for \\ncare and monitoring, especially indwelling arterial or venous \\ncatheters. Most children attain normal levels of procoagulant \\nand anticoagulant proteins by 1 year of age, although levels of \\nprotein C lag and normalize in adolescence.\\nHEMOSTATIC DISORDERS\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nA detailed family history is crucial to the diagnosis of bleeding \\nand thrombotic disorders. Hemophilia is X-linked, and almost \\nfactor VIII (8). In vivo, factor 7 autocatalyzes to form small \\namounts of factor 7a. When tissue is injured, tissue factor is \\nreleased and causes a burst of factor 7a generation. Tissue factor, \\nin combination with calcium and factor 7a, activates factor 9 \\nand factor 10. The activation of factor 9 by factor 7a results in \\neventual generation of thrombin, which feeds back on factor \\n11, generating factor 11a and accelerating thrombin formation. \\nThis process explains why deficiency of factor 8 or factor 9 leads \\nto severe bleeding disorders, whereas deficiency of factor 11 \\nis usually mild, and deficiency of factor 12 is asymptomatic.\\nA series of inhibitory factors serve to tightly regulate the \\nactivation of coagulation. Antithrombin III inactivates thrombin \\nand factors 10a, 9a, and 11a. The protein C and protein S  \\nsystem inactivates activated factors 5 and 8, which are cofactors \\nlocalized in the “tenase” and “prothrombinase” complexes. The \\ntissue factor pathway inhibitor, an anticoagulant protein, limits \\nactivation of the coagulation cascade by factor 7a and factor \\n10a. Fibrinolysis is initiated by the action of tissue plasmino-\\ngen activator on plasminogen, producing plasmin, the active \\nenzyme that degrades fibrin into split products.

Many platelet alloantigens have been identified \\nand sequenced, permitting prenatal diagnosis of the condition \\nin an at-risk fetus. Mothers with idiopathic thrombocytopenic \\npurpura (maternal ITP) or with a history of ITP may have \\npassive transfer of antiplatelet antibodies, with resultant neonatal \\nthrombocytopenia (see Chapter 59). The maternal platelet count \\nis sometimes a useful indicator of the probability that the infant \\nwill be affected.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe infant with NATP is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage \\nin utero and during the immediate delivery process. In ITP , \\nthe greatest risk seems to be present during passage through \\nthe birth canal, during which molding of the head may induce \\nintracranial hemorrhage. Fetal scalp sampling or percutaneous \\numbilical blood sampling may be performed to measure the \\nfetal platelet count.\\nTreatment\\nAdministration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) before \\ndelivery increases fetal platelet counts and may alleviate \\nthrombocytopenia in infants with NATP and ITP . Delivery by \\ncesarean section is recommended to prevent central nervous \\nsystem (CNS) bleeding (see Chapter 59). Neonates with severe \\nthrombocytopenia (platelet counts <20,000/mm3) may be treated \\nwith IVIG or corticosteroids or both until thrombocytopenia \\nremits. If necessary, infants with NATP may receive washed \\nmaternal platelets.\\nIdiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\\nEtiology\\nAutoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura of childhood (child-\\nhood ITP) is a common disorder that usually follows an \\nThrombocytopenia Resulting From Decreased \\nPlatelet Production\\nPrimary disorders of megakaryopoiesis (platelet production) \\nare rare in childhood, other than as part of an aplastic syndrome. \\nThrombocytopenia with absent radii syndrome is characterized \\nby severe thrombocytopenia in association with orthopedic \\nabnormalities, especially of the upper extremity. The throm-\\nbocytopenia usually improves over time. Amegakaryocytic \\nthrombocytopenia presents at birth or shortly thereafter with \\nfindings of severe thrombocytopenia, but no other congenital \\nanomalies. The marrow is devoid of megakaryocytes and usually \\nprogresses to aplasia of all hematopoietic cell lines.\\nAcquired thrombocytopenia as a result of decreased produc-\\ntion is rarely an isolated finding. It is seen more often in the \\ncontext of pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure \\ncaused by infiltrative or aplastic processes. Certain chemothera-\\npeutic agents may affect megakaryocytes selectively more than \\nother marrow elements. Cyanotic congenital heart disease with \\npolycythemia often is associated with thrombocytopenia, but \\nthis is rarely severe or associated with significant clinical bleed-\\ning. Congenital (TORCH [toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, \\ncytomegalovirus, herpes simplex]) and acquired viral infections \\n(human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], Epstein-Barr virus, and \\nmeasles) and some drugs (anticonvulsants, antibiotics, cytotoxic \\nagents, heparin, and quinidine) may induce thrombocytopenia. \\nPostnatal infections and drug reactions usually cause transient \\nthrombocytopenia, whereas congenital infections may produce \\nprolonged suppression of bone marrow function.\\nThrombocytopenia Resulting From  \\nPeripheral Destruction\\nEtiology\\nIn a child who appears well, immune-mediated mechanisms \\nare the most common cause of thrombocytopenia result-\\ning from rapid peripheral destruction of antibody-coated \\nplatelets by reticuloendothelial cells.

Significant adenopathy or \\nhepatosplenomegaly is unusual, and the red blood cell (RBC) \\nand white blood cell (WBC) counts are normal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ITP usually is based on clinical presentation \\nand the platelet count and does not often require a bone marrow \\nexamination. If atypical findings are noted, however, marrow \\nexamination is indicated to rule out an infiltrative disorder \\n(leukemia) or an aplastic process (aplastic anemia). In ITP , an \\nexamination of the bone marrow reveals increased megakaryo-\\ncytes and normal erythroid and myeloid elements.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nTherapy is seldom indicated for platelet counts greater than \\n30,000/mm3. Therapy does not affect the long-term outcome \\nof ITP but is intended to increase the platelet count acutely. \\nFor moderate and severe clinical bleeding with severe throm-\\nbocytopenia (platelet count <10,000/mm3), therapeutic options \\ninclude prednisone, starting dose of 2 mg/kg per 24 hours for \\n2 weeks or IVIG, 1 g/kg p er 24 hours for 1-2 days. All of these \\napproaches seem to decrease the rate of clearance of sensitized \\nplatelets, rather than decreasing production of antibody. The \\noptimal choice for therapy (if any) is controversial. Splenectomy \\nis indicated in acute ITP only for life-threatening bleeding. \\nApproximately 80% of children have a spontaneous resolution \\nof ITP within 6 months after diagnosis. Serious bleeding, \\nespecially intracranial bleeding, occurs in fewer than 1% of \\npatients with ITP . There is no evidence that early treatment \\nprevents intracranial bleeding.\\nITP that persists for 6-12 months is classified as chronic \\nITP. Repeated treatments with IVIG, IV anti-D, or high-dose \\npulse steroids are effective in delaying the need for splenec-\\ntomy. Secondary causes of chronic ITP , especially SLE and \\nHIV infection, should be ruled out. Splenectomy induces a \\nremission in 70-80% of childhood chronic ITP cases. The risks \\nof splenectomy (surgery, sepsis from encapsulated bacteria, \\npulmonary hypertension) must be weighed against the risk \\nof severe bleeding.\\nOther Disorders\\nacute viral infection. Childhood ITP is caused by an antibody  \\n(IgG or IgM) that binds to the platelet membrane. The condi-\\ntion results in Fc receptor–mediated splenic destruction of \\nantibody-coated platelets.

Deficiency of \\nglycoprotein Ib complex (VWF receptor) causes Bernard-\\nSoulier syndrome. A deficiency of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (the \\nfibrinogen receptor) causes Glanzmann thrombasthenia.

Recombinant factor 8 and \\nfactor 9 concentrates are safe from virally transmitted illnesses. \\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the most \\ncommon cause of death in older hemophilia patients (who \\nreceived plasma-derived factors). Many older patients also have \\nchronic hepatitis C.\\nInhibitors are IgG antibodies directed against transfused \\nfactor 8 or factor 9 in congenitally deficient patients. Inhibitors \\narise in 15% of patients with severe factor 8 deficiency but are \\nless common in patients with severe factor 9 deficiency. They \\nmay be high or low titer and show an anamnestic response to \\ntreatment. The treatment of bleeding patients with an inhibitor \\nis difficult. For low titer inhibitors, options include continu-\\nous factor 8 infusions. For high titer inhibitors, it is usually \\nnecessary to administer a product that bypasses the inhibitor, \\npreferably recombinant factor 7a. Activated prothrombin \\ncomplex concentrates, used in the past to treat inhibitor patients, \\nparadoxically increased the risks of thrombosis, resulting in fatal \\ncomplications, such as myocardial infarction. For long-term \\ntreatment of inhibitor patients, induction of immune tolerance \\nby repeated infusion of the deficient factor with or without \\nimmunosuppression may be beneficial.\\nEarly institution of factor replacement and continuous \\nprophylaxis beginning in early childhood should prevent the \\nchronic joint disease associated with hemophilia.\\nvon Willebrand Disease\\nEtiology\\nvon Willebrand disease is a common disorder (1% of the \\npopulation) caused by a deficiency of VWF, an adhesive protein \\nthat serves two functions: acting as a bridge between suben -\\ndothelial collagen and platelets and binding and protecting \\ncirculating factor 8 from rapid clearance from circulation. von \\nWillebrand disease usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant \\ntrait and, rarely, as an autosomal recessive trait. VWF may be \\neither quantitatively deficient (partial = type 1 or absolute = \\ntype 3) or qualitatively abnormal (type 2 = dysproteinemia). \\nApproximately 80% of patients with von Willebrand disease \\nhave classic (type 1) disease (i.e., a mild to moderate deficiency \\nof VWF). Several other subtypes are clinically important, each \\nrequiring different therapy.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nMucocutaneous bleeding, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, cuta -\\nneous bruising, and menorrhagia occur in patients with von \\nWillebrand disease. In severe disease, factor 8 deficiency may \\nbe profound, and the patient may also have manifestations \\nsimilar to hemophilia A (hemarthrosis). Findings in classic \\nvon Willebrand disease differ from findings in hemophilia A \\nand B (see Table 151.3).\\nLaboratory Testing\\nVWF testing involves measurement of the amount of protein, \\nusually measured immunologically as the VWF antigen \\n(VWF:Ag). VWF activity (VWF:Act) is measured functionally \\nin the ristocetin cofactor assay (VWFR:Co), which uses the \\nantibiotic ristocetin to induce VWF to bind to platelets. VWF \\nmultimer testing is done to assess the protein structure and \\nassists in the diagnosis of the qualitative disorders (type 2 = \\ndysproteinemia).\\nplatelet plug that has formed in areas of vascular injury. The \\nseverity of the disorder is determined by the degree of clotting \\nfactor deficiency.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nPatients with less than 1% (severe hemophilia) factor 8 or factor \\n9 may have spontaneous bleeding or bleeding with minor \\ntrauma. Patients with 1-5% (moderate hemophilia) factor 8 or \\nfactor 9 usually require moderate trauma to induce bleeding \\nepisodes. In mild hemophilia (>5% factor 8 or factor 9), sig -\\nnificant trauma is necessary to induce bleeding; spontaneous \\nbleeding does not occur. Mild hemophilia may go undiagnosed \\nfor many years, whereas severe hemophilia manifests in infancy \\nwhen the child reaches the toddler stage. In severe hemophilia, \\nspontaneous bleeding occurs, usually in the muscles or joints \\n(hemarthroses).\\nLaboratory Studies\\nThe diagnosis of hemophilia is based on a prolonged aPTT. \\nIn the aPTT, a surface-active agent activates the intrinsic system \\nof coagulation, of which factors 8 and 9 are crucial components. \\nIn factor 8 or factor 9 deficiency, the aPTT is quite prolonged \\nbut should correct to normal when the patient’s plasma is mixed \\n1 :  1 w ith normal plasma. When an abnormal aPTT is obtained, \\nspecific factor assays are needed to make a precise diagnosis \\n(see Table 151.2) to determine the appropriate factor replacement \\ntherapy. Prenatal diagnosis and carrier diagnosis are possible \\nusing molecular techniques.\\nTreatment\\nEarly, appropriate replacement therapy is the hallmark of \\nexcellent hemophilia care. Acute bleeding episodes are best \\ntreated in the home when the patient has attained the appropriate \\nage and the parents have learned home treatment. Bleeding \\nassociated with surgery, trauma, or dental extraction often can \\nbe anticipated, and excessive bleeding can be prevented with \\nappropriate replacement therapy. Prophylactic therapy starting \\nin infancy has greatly diminished the likelihood of chronic \\narthropathy in children with hemophilia. For life-threatening \\nbleeding, levels of 80-100% of normal factor 8 or factor 9 are \\nnecessary. For mild to moderate bleeding episodes (hemar-\\nthroses), a 40% level for factor 8 or a 30-40% level for factor \\n9 is appropriate. The dose can be calculated using the knowledge \\nthat 1 U/kg b ody weight of factor 8 increases the plasma level \\n2%, whereas 1.5  U/kg o f recombinant factor 9 increases the \\nplasma level 1%:\\nDose for factor desired levelw eightk g80 5=× ×(%)( ).\\nor\\nDose for recombinant factor\\ndesired levelw eightk g\\n9\\n1=× ×(%)( ). .5\\nDesmopressin acetate is a synthetic vasopressin analog with \\nminimal vasopressor effect.

Desmopressin is the treatment of choice for most \\nbleeding episodes in patients with type 1 disease and some \\npatients with type 2 disease. When high levels of VWF are \\nneeded but cannot be achieved satisfactorily with desmopressin, \\ntreatment with a virally attenuated, VWF-containing concen-\\ntrate (Humate P) may be appropriate. The dosage can be \\ncalculated as for factor 8 in hemophilia. Cryoprecipitate should \\nnot be used because it is not virally attenuated. Hepatitis B \\nvaccine should be given before the patient is exposed to plasma-\\nderived products. As in all bleeding disorders, aspirin and \\nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be avoided.\\nVitamin K Deficiency\\nFor discussion of vitamin K deficiency, see Chapters 27 and 31.\\nDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation\\nEtiology\\nDIC is a disorder in which widespread activation of the coagula-\\ntion mechanism is usually associated with shock. Normal \\nhemostasis is a balance between hemorrhage and thrombosis. \\nIn DIC, this balance is altered by the severe illness, so the \\npatient has activation of coagulation (thrombosis) mediated \\nby thrombin and fibrinolysis mediated by plasmin (bleeding). \\nCoagulation factors—especially platelets, fibrinogen, and factors \\n2, 5, and 8—are consumed, as are the anticoagulant proteins, \\nespecially antithrombin, protein C, and plasminogen. Endothelial \\ninjury, tissue release of thromboplastic procoagulant factors, \\nor, rarely, exogenous factors (snake venoms) directly activate \\nthe coagulation mechanism (Table 151.4).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe diagnosis of DIC usually is suspected clinically and is \\nconfirmed by laboratory findings of a decline in platelets and \\nfibrinogen associated with elevated prothrombin time, partial \\nthromboplastin time, and elevated levels of D-dimer, formed \\nwhen fibrinogen is clotted and then degraded by plasmin (Table \\n151.5). In some patients, DIC may evolve more slowly and \\nthere may be a degree of compensation. In a severely ill patient, \\nthe sudden occurrence of bleeding from a venipuncture or \\nincision site, gastrointestinal or pulmonary hemorrhage, \\npetechiae, or ecchymosis or evidence of peripheral gangrene \\nor thrombosis suggests the diagnosis of DIC.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of DIC is challenging. General guidelines in -\\nclude the following: treat the disorder inducing the DIC first; \\nsupport the patient by correcting hypoxia, acidosis, and poor \\nperfusion; and replace depleted blood-clotting factors, platelets, \\nand anticoagulant proteins by transfusion.\\nHeparin may be used to treat significant arterial or venous \\nthrombotic disease unless sites of life-threatening bleeding \\ncoexist.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Indwelling catheters, \\nvasculitis, sepsis, immobilization, nephrotic syndrome, coagu-\\nlopathy, trauma, infection, surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, \\noral contraceptive agents, pregnancy, and abortion all predispose \\nto thrombosis. The manifestations of pulmonary emboli vary \\nfrom no findings to chest pain, diminished breath sounds, a \\nloud S2, cyanosis, tachypnea, and hypoxemia.\\nDiagnostic and Imaging Studies\\nVenous thrombosis can be detected noninvasively by ultrasound \\nDoppler flow compression studies. The gold standard for \\ndiagnosis is the venogram. An abnormal (high probability) \\nventilation-perfusion scan or detection of an intravascular \\nthrombus on helical computed tomography is diagnostic of \\npulmonary emboli. There are no appropriate screening studies \\nfor thrombotic disorders. Diagnosis of a congenital or acquired \\npredisposition to thrombosis requires a battery of specific assays.\\nTreatment\\nTherapy of thrombotic disorders depends on the underlying \\ncondition and usually involves standard or low molecular weight \\nheparin followed by longer term anticoagulation with warfarin. \\nNew agents, including the direct thrombin inhibitors, are \\ncurrently under active investigation in the pediatric population. \\nMajor vessel thrombosis, life-threatening thrombosis, or arterial \\nthrombosis may necessitate treatment with fibrinolytic agents \\n(recombinant tissue plasminogen activator). In newborns, \\ninherited deficiency syndromes may present as emergencies \\nand necessitate replacement with plasma, antithrombin III \\nconcentrates, or protein C concentrates.\\nCHAPTER 152 \\nBlood Component Therapy\\nTransfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, plasma, \\ncryoprecipitate, and granulocytes can be lifesaving or life-\\nmaintaining (Table 152.1). Whole blood is rarely indicated \\nand is most useful to provide both oxygen-carrying capacity \\nThrombosis\\nEtiology\\nA hereditary predisposition to thrombosis (see Table 151.1) may \\nbe caused by a deficiency of an anticoagulant protein (protein \\nC or S, antithrombin,  or plasminogen) (Fig. 151.5), by an \\nabnormality of a procoagulant protein making it resistant to \\nproteolysis by its respective inhibitor (factor 5 Leiden), by \\na mutation resulting in an increased level of a procoagulant \\nprotein (prothrombin 20210), or by damage to endothelial cells \\n(homocysteinemia). Neonates with deficiency syndromes may \\nbe particularly vulnerable to thrombosis. Neonates with homo-\\nzygous protein C deficiency present with purpura fulminans \\nor thrombosis of the major arteries and veins or both. Many \\nindividuals with an inherited predisposition to thrombosis \\nexhibit symptoms in adolescence or early adulthood. Protein \\nC deficiency presenting in adulthood usually is inherited as \\nan autosomal dominant trait, whereas the homozygous form \\nusually is autosomal recessive. Protein S and antithrombin \\nIII deficiencies are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. \\nFactor 5 Leiden is the most common hereditary cause of a \\nTABLE 151.5 Differential Diagnosis of Coagulopathies That Can Be Confused With Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\\nPROTHROMBIN \\nTIME\\nPARTIAL \\nTHROMBOPLASTIN \\nTIMEFIBRINOGEN PLATELETS D-DIMER CLINICAL KEY(S)\\nDIC ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ↑ Shock\\nLiver failure ↑ ↑ ↓ Normal or ↓ ↑ Jaundice\\nVitamin K deficiency ↑ ↑ Normal Normal Normal Malabsorption, \\nliver disease\\nSepsis without shock ↑ ↑ Normal Normal ↑ or normal Fever\\nDIC, Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\nFrom Scott JP.

Although only about 1% of new \\ncancer cases in the United States occur among children younger \\nthan 19 years of age, cancer is the leading cause of disease-related \\ndeath in children age 1-14 years. Hematopoietic tumors \\n(leukemia, lymphoma) are the most common childhood cancers, \\nfollowed by brain/central nervous system (CNS) tumors and \\nsarcomas of soft tissue and bone (Fig. 153.1). There is wide \\nvariability in the age-specific incidence of childhood cancers. \\nEmbryonal tumors, such as neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma, \\npeak during the first 2 years of life; acute lymphoblastic leukemia \\n(ALL) peaks during early childhood (ages 2-5 years); osteo-\\nsarcoma peaks during adolescence; and Hodgkin disease peaks \\nduring late adolescence (Fig. 153.2). The overall incidence of \\ncancer among white children is higher than that among other \\nethnic groups and is twice that of African American children \\nin the United States.\\nHISTORY\\nMany signs and symptoms of childhood cancer are nonspecific. \\nAlthough most children with fever, fatigue, weight loss, or limp \\ndo not have cancer, each of these symptoms may be a manifesta-\\ntion of an underlying malignancy. Uncommonly, a child with \\ncancer will have no symptoms at all. An abdominal mass may \\nbe palpated on routine examination, or a complete blood count \\n(CBC) may be unexpectedly abnormal. Some children have a \\ngenetic susceptibility to cancer and should be screened appro-\\npriately (Table 153.1).\\nIt is important to explore quality, duration, location, severity, \\nand precipitating events of the chief complaint. A prominent \\nlymph node that does not resolve (with or without antibiotics) \\nmay warrant a biopsy. A limp that does not improve within \\nweeks should prompt a CBC and a radiograph. Fever, night \\nsweats, or weight loss should raise the concern for lymphoma. \\nIn addition, it is important to obtain the birth history, medical \\nand surgical history, growth history, developmental history, \\nfamily history, and social history. Even though family history \\nin most patients does not predict an underlying predisposi-\\ntion syndrome, cancer-predisposing genes (such as TP53) \\nare mutated in approximately 9% of children and adolescents  \\nwith cancer.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nGrowth parameters and vital signs are important to obtain \\nin all patients. Pulse oximetry should be obtained if respira-\\ntory symptoms are present. The overall appearance of the  \\npatient should be noted, particularly general appearance, pain, \\ncachexia, pallor, and respiratory distress. Palpable masses \\nshould be measured. Lymphadenopathy and organomegaly \\nshould be quantified, if present. A thorough examination of \\nthe skin may reveal rashes, bruises, and petechiae. Careful \\nneurological and ophthalmological examinations are crucial \\nif headache or vomiting is present because the vast majority \\nof patients with CNS tumors have abnormal neurological  \\nexaminations.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nVisual Impairment and Leukocoria\\nVomiting\\nHepatomegaly\\nSplenomegaly\\nHeadaches\\nLymphadenopathy\\nAnemia\\nPetechiae/Purpura\\nPancytopenia\\nFever of Unknown Origin\\nThe most common manifestations of childhood cancer are \\nfatigue, anorexia, malaise, pain, fever, abnormal lump or mass, \\npallor, bruising, petechiae, bleeding, headache, vomiting, visual \\nchanges, weight loss, and night sweats (Table 153.2). Lymph-\\nadenopathy and organomegaly are common in leukemia, \\nparticularly with T-cell ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients \\nwith solid tumors usually have a palpable or measurable mass. \\nOther signs and symptoms may include limp, cough, dyspnea, \\ncranial nerve palsies, and papilledema. In general, malignant \\nmasses are firm, fixed, and nontender, whereas masses that are \\ninfectious or inflammatory in nature are relatively softer, mobile, \\nand tender to palpation.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Immune \\ndeficiencies or irregularities (autoimmune hemolytic anemia \\nor neutropenia) can also produce cytopenias. Juvenile idio-\\npathic arthritis and other collagen vascular disease can cause \\nmusculoskeletal pain and anemia, mimicking leukemia. Benign \\ntumors are relatively common in children, including mature \\ngerm cell tumors/hamartomas, hemangiomas or other vascular \\ntumors, mesoblastic nephromas, and bone cysts.\\nINITIAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION\\nScreening Tests\\nA CBC with differential and review of the peripheral blood \\nsmear is the best screening test for many pediatric malignancies. \\nLeukopenia (with or without neutropenia), anemia, or throm-\\nbocytopenia may be present in leukemia or any cancer that \\ninvades the bone marrow (e.g., neuroblastoma, rhabdomyo-\\nsarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma). Leukemia may also produce \\nleukocytosis, usually with blasts present on the peripheral blood \\nsmear. An isolated cytopenia (neutropenia, anemia, or throm-\\nbocytopenia) widens the differential diagnosis but still may be \\nthe only abnormal laboratory finding. Of note, a patient with \\nleukemia may also have a normal CBC. Lactate dehydrogenase \\nand uric acid are often elevated in fast-growing tumors (leukemia \\nor lymphoma) and occasionally in sarcomas or neuroblastoma. \\nIn many cases, it is appropriate to assess electrolytes and renal \\nand hepatic function in the screening process. Elevated blood \\npressure, if confirmed by repeat measurements, should prompt \\na urinalysis, as should the palpation of an abdominal mass. \\nSerum (and/or cerebrospinal fluid) alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) \\nand beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) are screening \\ntests (and tumor markers) for germ cell tumors. Serum AFP \\nis also a tumor marker for hepatoblastoma. Urine homovanillic \\nacid (HV A) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) are tumor markers \\nfor neuroblastoma.\\nDiagnostic Imaging\\nA chest x-ray (CXR; posteroanterior and lateral) is the best \\nscreening radiographic study for a patient with suspicious \\ncervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. Mediastinal \\nmasses and pleural effusions can often be detected on CXR. \\nAbdominal signs or symptoms warrant an ultrasound or com-\\nputed tomography (CT) scan. Persistent headaches or morning \\nvomiting should prompt a CT or magnetic resonance imaging \\n(MRI) scan of the head. If bone tumors are suspected, plain \\nradiographs are indicated and will usually reveal the lesion(s), \\nif present. Radiographs may be normal when a bony pelvic \\nlesion is suspected; thus a CT or MRI should be obtained. \\nOther imaging studies to delineate a mass and to search for \\nsuspected metastases are often indicated, but these decisions \\nare usually best left to the pediatric oncology team with \\ninput from radiologists. Table 153.3 shows the general use of \\ndiagnostic imaging following confirmation of a diagnosis of \\ncancer to assess the primary tumor and metastases. Positron \\nemission tomography (PET), with or without CT, has proved \\nuseful for staging and assessing response for lymphomas and \\nsarcomas. Metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) scans are useful \\nfor neuroblastoma.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDistinguishing a malignant process from another disease can be \\ndifficult. Ultimately, a tissue diagnosis (from bone marrow or \\nsolid tumor biopsy) with pathological confirmation is required to \\nconfirm a diagnosis of cancer. Infection commonly masquerades \\nas a potential malignancy. In particular Epstein-Barr virus, \\ncytomegalovirus, and mycobacterial infections can mimic \\nleukemia or lymphoma by causing fever, lymphadenopathy, \\norganomegaly, weight loss, and abnormal blood counts. \\nTrauma may produce swelling that can mimic solid tumors. \\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and iron deficiency can \\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): 20%\\nBrain and central nervous system: 18%\\nHodgkin disease: 8%\\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma: 7%\\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML): 5%\\nNeuroblastoma: 5%\\nBone tumors*: 5%\\nThyroid carcinoma: 4%\\nWilms / kidney: 3%\\nGerm cell tumors: 3%\\nRhabdomyosarcoma: 2%\\nRetinoblastoma: 2%\\nMelanoma: 2%\\nOther: 16%\\n*Includes osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma\\nFIGURE 153.1 Number of Childhood Cancer Diagnoses per Year. \\nTotal = 15,780, Age 0-19 years.

Tumors with a large tumor burden (e.g., \\nlymphoma, leukemia) may affect renal function adversely from \\ntubular deposition of uric acid crystals. Allopurinol or rasbu-\\nricase can be administered before chemotherapy to minimize  \\nthis effect.\\nA common metabolic emergency is tumor lysis syndrome, \\noften seen in treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Large \\namounts of phosphate, potassium, and uric acid are released \\ninto the circulation from lysed cells. Overwhelming infection \\nand spinal cord compression with neurological compromise \\nare other oncological emergencies.\\nSURGERY\\nAppropriate imaging (usually with computed tomography \\n[CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for solid tumors \\npresenting as a palpable mass or mass-related symptoms (pain, \\nrespiratory distress, intestinal obstruction) should be obtained \\nand followed by resection (when possible) or biopsy (if complete \\nresection is not feasible or indicated). Pediatric lymphomas \\nare chemosensitive and rarely require complete surgical  \\nresection.\\nIt is crucial to determine the amount of tissue required and \\nthe appropriate distribution of the tissue for testing so that all \\nnecessary studies are performed. A general oncological surgery \\nprinciple is to resect not just the tumor but also, in most cases, \\na surrounding margin of normal tissue to ensure the entire \\ntumor has been resected.\\nCHAPTER 154 \\nPrinciples of Cancer Treatment\\nThe overall goal of pediatric oncology is to cure all patients \\nwith minimal toxicity. Treatment for children with cancer is \\noften multimodal and may involve surgery, radiation therapy, \\nchemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Surgery and radiation are \\ngenerally local treatment modalities (an exception is total body \\nirradiation as part of a bone marrow or stem cell transplant), \\nwhereas chemotherapy and immunotherapy have both local and  \\nsystemic effects.\\nPrimary prevention strategies for most pediatric malignancies \\nare unknown. Two exceptions are the use of hepatitis B vaccine \\nto lower the rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and the use of \\nhuman papillomavirus vaccine to reduce the risk of genitouri-\\nnary and oropharyngeal cancers. Childhood malignancies are \\nnot associated with tobacco or alcohol use, dietary factors, or \\nsun exposure. Treatment with certain chemotherapy agents and \\nradiation therapy increases the rate of second malignancies. \\nSecondary prevention may be accomplished by screening the \\nat-risk child (e.g., a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syn-\\ndrome or twin of a leukemia patient), but these opportunities  \\nare rare.\\nONCOLOGICAL EMERGENCIES\\nAdverse effects of tumors and treatments may result in onco -\\nlogical emergencies in children and adolescents (Table 154.1). \\nTABLE 153.3 Minimum Work-Up Required for Common Pediatric Malignancies to Assess Primary Tumor and Potential \\nMetastases*\\nMALIGNANCY BMA/bx CXR CT Scan MRI\\nBONE SCAN, \\nPET SCAN, or \\nPET-CT SCAN CSF ANALYSIS MARKER(S) OTHER\\nLeukemia Yes Yes — — — Yes — —\\nNon-Hodgkin \\nlymphoma\\nYes Yes Yes — Yes Yes — —\\nHodgkin lymphoma Yes Yes Yes — Yes — — —\\nCNS tumors — — — Yes — Yes — —\\nNeuroblastoma Yes — Yes — Yes — VMA, HVA mIBG scan\\nWilms tumor — Yes Yes — — — — —\\nRhabdomyosarcoma Yes Yes Yes — Yes Yes, for \\nparameningeal \\ntumors only\\n— —\\nOsteosarcoma — Yes Yes (chest) Yes (primary) Yes — — —\\nEwing sarcoma Yes Yes Yes (chest) Yes (primary) Yes — — —\\nGerm cell tumors — Yes Yes — — — AFP, \\nβ-hCG\\nConsider \\nbrain MRI\\nLiver tumors — Yes Yes — — — AFP —\\nRetinoblastoma ± — Yes, if MRI \\nnot available\\nYes (brain) ± Yes — Rb gene \\nanalysis\\n*Individual cases may require additional studies.\\nAFP, Alpha-fetoprotein; β-hCG, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin; BMA/bx, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy; CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; \\nCT, computed tomography; CXR, chest x-ray; HVA, homovanillic acid; mIBG, metaiodobenzylguanidine; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PET, positron emission \\ntomography; Rb, retinoblastoma; VMA, vanillylmandelic acid.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Targeted therapies specifi-\\ncally target the tumor cells, sparing normal host cells. Imatinib \\nand dasatinib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the effects \\nof the t(9;22) translocation (BCR-ABL) of chronic myeloid \\nleukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Rituximab is a \\nmonoclonal antibody directed against the cell surface antigen \\nCD20 expressed in some lymphomas. Dinutuximab is an \\nanti-GD2 monoclonal antibody used for neuroblastoma. Chimeric \\nantigen receptor T-cell therapy and bi-specific T-cell engager \\ntherapy are immunotherapies that leverage the patient’s own \\nT cells to kill cancer cells.\\nSupportive care also plays an important role in pediatric \\noncology, including the use of appropriate antimicrobial agents, \\nblood products, nutritional support, intensive care, and integra-\\ntive therapies.\\nADVERSE EFFECTS\\nBecause chemotherapy agents are cellular toxins, numerous \\nadverse effects are associated with their use. Bone marrow \\nsuppression, immunosuppression, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia \\nare general adverse effects of commonly used chemotherapy \\ndrugs. Each chemotherapy drug also has specific toxicities. \\nDoxorubicin can cause cardiac damage; cisplatin can cause \\nrenal damage and ototoxicity; cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide \\ncan cause hemorrhagic cystitis; and vincristine can cause \\nperipheral neuropathy. Radiation therapy produces many adverse \\neffects such as mucositis, growth retardation, organ dysfunction, \\nand the later development of secondary cancers. Significant \\ntherapy-related late effects may develop in pediatric cancer \\npatients (Table 154.3).\\nCHEMOTHERAPY\\nBecause most pediatric solid tumors have a high risk for micro-\\nmetastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, chemotherapy is used \\nin almost all cases (Table 154.2). Exceptions include low-stage \\nneuroblastoma and Wilms tumor (particularly in infants) and \\nlow-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors. For patients \\nwith localized solid tumors, chemotherapy administered \\nafter removal of the primary tumor is referred to as adjuvant \\ntherapy. Chemotherapy administered while the primary tumor \\nis still present is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. \\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy has a number of potential benefits, \\nincluding an early attack on presumed micrometastatic disease, \\nshrinkage of the primary tumor to facilitate local control, and \\nadditional time to plan for definitive surgery.\\nResistance to particular chemotherapeutic agents can develop \\nrelatively quickly. Thus combinations of chemotherapy drugs are \\nused, as opposed to sequential single agents, to treat childhood \\ncancer. The blood-brain barrier prevents the penetration of \\nchemotherapeutic drugs into the CNS. Thus administration \\nof the chemotherapeutic agent directly into the cerebrospinal \\nfluid (by lumbar puncture) is used for leukemia and lym-\\nphoma. Radiation therapy also circumvents the blood-brain  \\nbarrier.\\nRADIATION THERAPY\\nRadiation therapy is the process of delivering ionizing \\nradiation to malignant cells to kill them directly or, more \\ncommonly, prevent them from dividing by interfering  \\nwith DNA replication.

In chronic myeloid \\nleukemia (CML) and, less commonly, in acute lymphoblastic \\nleukemia (ALL), a translocation involving chromosomes 9 and \\n22 (Philadelphia [Ph] chromosome) creates a novel fusion gene \\ncalled BCR-ABL. This results in the production of a constitu -\\ntively activated tyrosine kinase that drives the development of \\nCML and Ph-positive ALL. In addition, a number of genetic \\nsyndromes/diseases including Down syndrome (Trisomy \\n21), Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, \\nWiskott-Aldrich syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and \\nrare familial leukemia syndromes can predispose children to \\nthe development of acute leukemia. Siblings of children with \\nleukemia are at an increased risk of developing leukemia with an \\napproximately two- to fourfold risk above the general pediatric \\npopulation (approximately 25% risk for monozygotic twins). \\nEnvironmental factors that may increase the risk of leukemia \\ninclude ionizing radiation and chemical exposures including \\ncertain chemotherapy agents (particularly the topoisomerase \\nII inhibitors).\\nSigns and symptoms of acute leukemia are related to the \\ninfiltration of leukemic cells into normal tissues, resulting in \\neither bone marrow failure (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocy-\\ntopenia) and/or specific tissue infiltration (lymph nodes, liver, \\nspleen, brain, bone, skin, gingiva, testes). Common presenting \\nsymptoms are fever, pallor, petechiae and/or ecchymoses, \\nlethargy, malaise, anorexia, and bone/joint pain. Physical \\nexamination frequently reveals lymphadenopathy and hepato-\\nsplenomegaly. The testes and central nervous system (CNS) \\nare common extramedullary sites for ALL involvement; neu-\\nrological symptoms or a painless enlargement of one or both \\ntestes may be seen. Patients with T-cell ALL often have high \\nwhite blood cell (WBC) counts, an anterior mediastinal mass \\n(mediastinal adenopathy and/or thymic infiltration), cervical \\nlymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and CNS involvement. \\nIn patients with AML, extramedullary soft tissue tumors may \\nbe found in various sites.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe diagnosis of acute leukemia is confirmed by findings of \\nimmature blast cells on the peripheral blood smear, bone \\nmarrow aspirate, or both.

Following induction \\ntherapy, patients undergo an end-of-induction bone marrow \\nevaluation to assess for remission (nearly all patients with ALL \\nachieve a remission). The intensity of postinduction therapy \\nrelies on risk adaptation using a variety of prognostic tools \\n(cytogenetics, rapidity and depth of remission using tests for \\nminimal residual disease [MRD], etc.). ALL patients with CNS \\ninvolvement detected at diagnosis often require more intensive \\ntreatment that can include an escalation in their intrathecal \\ntherapy as well as the use of cranial radiation therapy. Recently, \\nthe omission of cranial radiation therapy for all pediatric \\nleukemia patients holds great promise. Patients with ALL receive \\nchemotherapy for a total of 2-3 years. The treatment of AML \\nis divided into three general types including (1) acute promy-\\nelocytic leukemia with a t(15;17) translocation (PML-RARA) \\nthat relies heavily on all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide; \\n(2) myeloid leukemias of Down syndrome in which less intensive \\ntherapy is administered, and (3) AML that parallels the risk \\nand biological features most commonly seen in adult AML. \\nThe latter results in the need for intensive therapy and, in select \\nhigh-risk patients, the use of stem cell transplantation after \\ncompleting upfront intensive chemotherapy. The majority of \\npediatric patients with AML require four cycles of intensive \\ncytarabine-based chemotherapy for low- and intermediate-risk \\npatients and stem cell transplant for high-risk patients. Much \\nlike ALL, risk adaptive therapy is based on cytogenetics and \\nresponse to therapy. Additionally, the availability of a human \\nleukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor (ideally an HLA-\\nmatched sibling) determines the use of stem cell transplantation \\nin first remission. Unlike ALL, there is little evidence that \\nlow-dose continuation therapy is helpful in AML (with the \\nexception of acute promyelocytic leukemia).\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nMajor short-term complications associated with the treatment \\nof leukemia result from bone marrow suppression caused by \\nchemotherapy. Patients may have bleeding and significant anemia \\nthat necessitates transfusion of platelets and red blood cells. \\nThe development of neutropenia predisposes patients to a \\nsignificant risk of both bacterial and fungal infections. Cell-\\nmediated immunosuppression increases the risk of Pneumocystis \\njiroveci (carinii) pneumonia; hence, prophylaxis, most commonly \\nwith oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, is recommended. \\nProphylaxis with antibiotics and antifungal agents is becoming \\nmore commonplace, particularly in patients with AML who \\nare at high risk for treatment-related mortality (obese patients \\nand adolescent/young adult patients). Long-term sequelae of \\ntherapy are less common than in previous treatment eras but \\ncontinue to be a priority for prevention, recognition, and \\ntreatment. These sequelae include neurocognitive impairment, \\nshort stature, obesity, cardiac dysfunction, infertility, second \\nmalignant neoplasms, and psychosocial problems (Table 154.3).\\nPROGNOSIS\\nPatients with ALL are classified into prognostic risk groups \\n(B-lineage ALL currently separates patients into low, average, \\nhigh, and very high risk) based on age, initial WBC count, \\ngenetic characteristics (cytogenetics), extramedullary involve-\\nment at diagnosis (testicular and/or CNS involvement), and \\nresponse to induction therapy using MRD techniques. Risk \\nWBC count of 50,000/mm 3 or higher (hyperleukocytosis) at \\npresentation. Definitive diagnosis requires the evaluation of \\ncell surface markers (immunophenotype) by flow cytometry. \\nCytogenetic analysis should be undertaken in all cases of acute \\nleukemia because many reoccurring cytogenetic abnormalities \\nhave prognostic implications and are used, in combination with \\nother risk factors, to assign therapy to optimize outcome. In \\nB-lineage ALL, the t(12;21) translocation (previously called TEL/\\nAML; now referred to as ETV6/RUNX1) is the most common \\n(approximately 20% of all cases) and is associated with a favor-\\nable prognosis when combined with other low-risk features. The \\nt(9;22) translocation occurs in 3% of cases and, historically, has a \\npoor prognosis. However, much like in CML, the use of tyrosine \\nkinase inhibitors in Ph-positive ALL has resulted in dramatic \\nimprovements in outcomes. The t(4;11) translocation (and other \\ntranslocations involving the MLL gene on chromosome 11) \\noften occurs in infant ALL and patients with secondary AML \\n(often in patients that have been exposed to topoisomerase II \\ninhibitors). It is associated with a poor prognosis. Fluorescent in \\nsitu hybridization or polymerase chain reaction techniques are \\nnow used in most cases of leukemia because many chromosomal \\nabnormalities are not apparent on routine karyotypes. DNA \\nmicroarray techniques are becoming an important diagnostic \\nand prognostic tool. Recently, a new high-risk subgroup called \\nPhiladelphia-like ALL has been identified using this technique. \\nA lumbar puncture should always be performed at the time \\nof diagnosis to evaluate the possibility of CNS involvement. A \\nchest x-ray should be obtained in all patients to assess for an \\nanterior mediastinal mass. Electrolytes (particularly potassium, \\nphosphorous, and calcium), uric acid, and renal and hepatic \\nfunction should be monitored in all patients to assess and treat \\npatients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of acute leukemia includes nonma -\\nlignant and malignant diseases. Infection is probably the most \\ncommon mimicker of acute leukemia, particularly Epstein-Barr \\nvirus. Other infections (cytomegalovirus, other viruses, myco-\\nbacteria) may also produce signs and symptoms common to \\nleukemia. Noninfectious considerations include aplastic anemia, \\nhistiocytosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, immune thrombo-\\ncytopenic purpura, and congenital or acquired conditions that \\nresult in neutropenia or anemia. Several malignant diagnoses \\nincluding neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing \\nsarcoma can also mimic leukemia. Newborns with trisomy 21 \\nmay have a condition known as transient myeloproliferative \\ndisorder, which produces elevated WBC counts with peripheral \\nblasts, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. It usually resolves with \\nsupportive care only, but these children have a significantly \\nincreased risk (30%) of developing acute leukemia (ALL or \\nAML) within the next few months to years of life.\\nTREATMENT\\nPatients with B-lineage ALL generally receive three- or four-agent \\ninduction chemotherapy (patients with T-cell ALL receive a \\nfour-agent induction) based on their initial risk group assign-\\nment. Standard-risk patients receive vincristine, corticosteroids, \\nand pegylated asparaginase over 4 weeks; high-risk patients \\nalso receive an anthracycline (typically daunorubicin). Intrathe-\\ncal therapy with cytarabine or methotrexate is given to treat \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

There \\nare two major types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) \\nand non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The etiologies are mul-\\ntifactorial. Both congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies \\nare more commonly associated with NHL, whereas the \\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with both HL  \\nand NHL.\\nAlmost all cases of NHL in childhood are diffuse, highly \\nmalignant, and show little differentiation. NHL has three his-\\ntological subtypes: small noncleaved cell (Burkitt lymphoma), \\nlymphoblastic, and large cell. For simplicity, these may be \\nregarded as B cell, T cell, and large cell (which may be of \\nThe most common clinical presentation of HL is painless, firm \\nlymphadenopathy often confined to one or two contiguous \\nlymph node areas (most commonly the supraclavicular and \\ncervical nodes). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which produces \\ncough or shortness of breath, is a frequent presenting symptom. \\nThe presence of one of three B symptoms has prognostic value: \\nfever (>38°C for 3 consecutive days), drenching night sweats, \\nand unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within 6 months \\nof diagnosis.\\nThe sporadic (North American) form of Burkitt lymphoma \\nmore commonly has an abdominal presentation (typically with \\npain), whereas the endemic (African) form frequently presents \\nwith tumors of the jaw.

Patients \\nwith acute abdominal pain from Burkitt lymphoma may be \\nmisdiagnosed as having appendicitis.\\nTREATMENT\\nPediatric HL is highly curable even with advanced disease; \\noverall survival rates now exceed 90%. Risk-adaptive therapy \\nusing stage, the presence of bulky disease, the presence or \\nabsence of B symptoms, serum albumin, and the response to \\nupfront chemotherapy has been employed to reduce the need \\nfor radiation therapy and excess chemotherapy. Multiagent \\nchemotherapy usually consists of drugs such as doxorubicin, \\nvincristine, bleomycin, vinblastine, etoposide, prednisone, and \\ncyclophosphamide. In general, four to six courses of chemo-\\ntherapy are given. The use of anti-CD30 monoclonal therapy \\n(Brentuximab vedotin) and the elimination of bleomycin \\nare currently under investigation in pediatric HL. Response \\nto therapy is often assessed after two cycles of upfront che-\\nmotherapy, relying on PET (to assess metabolic response) \\nand computed tomography (CT; to assess bulk reduction) \\nto determine the need for subsequent chemotherapy (slow \\nresponse obligates more aggressive chemotherapy) and the \\nneed for radiation therapy.

Systemic chemotherapy is mandatory and should \\nbe administered to all children with NHL, even those with \\nclinically localized disease at diagnosis. B- and T-cell lym-\\nphoblastic lymphoma and ALCL are generally treated with \\naggressive multidrug regimens similar to the regimens used in \\nALL. Surgery and radiation therapy are not commonly used \\nbecause the disease is rarely localized and is highly sensitive \\nto chemotherapy.

In contrast, CNS tumors in adults \\nare often high-grade astrocytomas or secondary tumors that \\nare metastatic from other carcinomas. CNS tumors also may \\narise in patients previously treated with radiation therapy. CNS \\ntumors are likely multifactorial in etiology. The classification \\nof CNS tumors is complex and evolving, with the World  \\nHealth Organization classification being the most complete \\nand accurate system.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nCNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, \\nsecond to leukemia in overall cancer incidence during childhood. \\nHowever, due primarily to improved outcomes for leukemia, \\nCNS tumors are now the leading cause of childhood cancer \\ndeaths. About 1,700 new cases occur each year in the United \\nStates; the rate is approximately 33 cases per 1 million children \\nunder 15 years of age. The incidence peaks before age 10 years \\nand then decreases until a second peak after age 70. For medul-\\nloblastoma and ependymoma, males are more affected than \\nfemales; for other tumor types, no gender differences exist. In \\nthe first 2-3 years of life, whites are affected more than nonwhite \\nchildren; otherwise incidence rates are essentially equal for \\nwhites and nonwhite children.\\nBrain tumors can cause symptoms by impingement on normal \\ntissue (usually cranial nerves) or by an increase in intracranial \\npressure caused either by obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid \\n(CSF) flow or by a direct mass effect. Tumors that obstruct the \\nflow of CSF quickly become symptomatic. Symptoms of \\nincreased intracranial pressure are lethargy, headache, and \\nvomiting (particularly in the morning on awakening). Irritability, \\nanorexia, poor school performance, and loss of developmental \\nmilestones all may be signs of slow-growing CNS tumors. In \\nyoung children with open cranial sutures, an increase in head \\ncircumference may occur. Optic pathway tumors may lead to \\nloss of visual acuity or visual field defects. Inability to abduct \\nthe eye as the result of sixth cranial nerve palsy is a common \\nsign of increased intracranial pressure. Other cranial nerve \\ndeficits suggest involvement of the brainstem. Seizures occur \\nin 20-50% of patients with supratentorial tumors; focal weakness \\nor sensory changes also may be seen. Pituitary involvement \\ncan produce neuroendocrine effects such as precocious puberty \\nor diabetes insipidus. Cerebellar tumors are associated with \\nataxia and diminished coordination. A history and physical \\nexamination are fundamental for evaluation and should include \\na careful neurological assessment, including visual fields and \\na funduscopic examination.\\nLABORATORY/IMAGING STUDIES\\nIf an intracranial lesion is suspected, magnetic resonance \\nimaging (MRI) is currently the examination of choice (Fig. \\n157.1). Examination of CSF by cytocentrifuge histological testing \\nis indicated to determine the presence of metastatic disease in \\nprimitive neuroectodermal tumors, germ cell tumors, and pineal \\nregion tumors. A lumbar puncture should not be performed \\nbefore imaging has been obtained to evaluate for evidence \\nof increased intracranial pressure. If a tumor is suspected \\nto have metastatic potential (medulloblastoma), MRI of the \\nentire spine should be obtained before surgery to assess for \\nneuraxial dissemination. A postoperative MRI study of the \\nbrain should be obtained within 24-48 hours of surgery to \\nassess the extent of resection.

High-dose dexamethasone is often administered \\nimmediately to reduce tumor-associated edema. Surgical objec-\\ntives are complete excision, if possible, and maximal debulking \\nif a complete excision is not possible. In children, radiation \\ntherapy is often combined with chemotherapy; in young children, \\nradiation therapy may be delayed or avoided altogether. Proton \\nradiation therapy is an emerging therapy that holds promise \\nfor decreased toxicity. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors \\n(including medulloblastoma) and germ cell tumors are sensitive \\nto chemotherapy; gliomas are less sensitive to chemotherapy. \\nChemotherapy plays an especially important role in infants in \\nwhom the effects of high-dose CNS radiation may have devastat-\\ning effects on growth and neurocognitive development.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nShort-term adverse effects of therapy include nausea, vomiting, \\nanorexia, fatigue, immunosuppression, and cushingoid features. \\nLong-term adverse effects include neurocognitive deficits, \\nendocrinological sequelae, decreased bone growth, ototoxicity, \\nrenal insufficiency, cataracts, infertility, and second malignant \\nneoplasms. The neurocognitive deficits can be significant, \\nparticularly in infants and young children, and are the primary \\nreason for the continued search for the lowest efficacious \\nradiation therapy dose and the most conformal delivery methods \\nfor the radiation therapy boosts. Posterior fossa syndrome \\n(also known as “cerebellar mutism”) occurs in up to 25% of \\npatients after resection of a posterior fossa tumor and is \\ncharacterized by an acute decrease in speech, behavioral changes \\n(e.g., irritability, apathy, or both), diffuse cerebellar dysfunction, \\nand other neurological abnormalities. It may begin within hours \\nto days of surgery and is usually self-resolving within weeks \\nto months, although some neurological complications may \\npersist. Somnolence syndrome, which is characterized by \\nexcessive fatigue and sleepiness, may occur in the months after \\ncompletion of radiation therapy and is self-limited.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nImprovements in neurodiagnosis, neurosurgical techniques, \\nchemotherapy regimens, and radiation therapy techniques \\nhave improved overall outcome. The 5-year overall survival \\nrate associated with all childhood CNS tumors is approximately \\n50-60%, resulting in large measure from the high curability of \\ncerebellar astrocytomas and the increasing cure rate for patients \\nwith medulloblastoma (Table 157.1).

Ultrasound or CT examination \\nusually differentiates the tumors prior to surgery. Periorbital \\necchymoses from orbital metastases can be mistaken for child \\nabuse. Because children with bone marrow involvement may \\nhave anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, leukemia is \\noften considered in the differential.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment of neuroblastoma is based on risk classification (Table \\n158.1), an evolving scheme based on emerging genetic discover-\\nies, and treatment advances. Complete surgical excision is the \\ninitial treatment of choice for localized neuroblastoma. Children \\nwith very low– or low-risk tumors who undergo a gross total \\nresection require no further therapy. Patients with intermediate-\\nrisk disease are usually treated with surgery and 4-8 cycles of \\nchemotherapy. In patients with high-risk disease, combination \\nchemotherapy is given after confirmation of the diagnosis. The \\nmost commonly used agents are vincristine, cyclophosphamide, \\ntopotecan, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide. Resection of \\nthe primary tumor is undertaken after several courses of \\nchemotherapy. Patients then undergo high-dose chemotherapy \\nwith autologous stem cell rescue; recent data suggest two \\ncourses of high-dose therapy are better than one. Radiation \\ntherapy is then administered to the primary tumor bed and \\nareas of metastatic disease. Finally, cis-retinoic acid (isotreti-\\nnoin) and Dinutuximab (a form of immunotherapy directed \\nagainst the G D2 antigen) are administered to treat minimal \\nresidual disease.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nSpinal cord compression from neuroblastoma may cause an \\nirreversible neurological deficit and is an oncological emergency. \\nChildren with opsomyoclonus syndrome may suffer from \\ndevelopmental delay. The aggressive chemotherapy and radiation \\ntherapies currently used to treat high-risk neuroblastoma may \\nresult in complications such as ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, \\ngrowth problems, and second malignancies.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nThe prognosis is affected by age at diagnosis, stage (based on \\npresence or absence of metastasis and image-defined risk \\nfactors), DNA ploidy, MYCN status, 11q aberration, and his -\\ntopathology (grade of tumor differentiation). Currently, children \\nwith neuroblastoma can be divided into four groups: very low, \\nlow, intermediate, and high risk. Patients with favorable biology \\ntend to be younger and often have localized disease. Older \\npatients with metastatic disease most commonly have unfavor-\\nable biology; approximately 50% will ultimately relapse due to \\ndrug-resistant residual disease. Although neuroblastoma \\nrepresents only 8% of cases of childhood cancer, it is responsible \\nfor 15% of cancer deaths in children.\\ncause is unknown. Most cases occur in young children. Neu-\\nroblastoma may rarely (1-2% of cases) be hereditary. Mutations \\nin the ALK, PHOX2B, and TP53 genes have been associated \\nwith familial cases. In sporadic cases, several somatic genetic \\nmutations have been identified, with MYCN amplification being \\nthe most common.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nNeuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor \\nof childhood and the most common malignancy in infancy. \\nThe median age at diagnosis is 17 months.

Children with localized \\ndisease are often asymptomatic at diagnosis, whereas children \\nwith metastases often appear ill and have systemic complaints \\nsuch as fever, weight loss, and pain. The most common presenta-\\ntion is abdominal pain or mass. The mass is often palpated in \\nthe abdomen or flank and is hard and nontender. Approximately \\n45% of tumors arise in the adrenal gland, and 25% arise in the \\nretroperitoneal sympathetic ganglia. Other sites of origin are \\nthe paravertebral ganglia of the chest and neck. Paraspinal \\ntumors may invade through the neural foramina and cause \\nspinal cord compression. Horner syndrome is sometimes seen \\nwith neck or apical masses. Several paraneoplastic syndromes, \\nincluding secretory diarrhea, profuse sweating, and opsomy-\\noclonus, are associated with neuroblastoma.\\nNeuroblastoma may metastasize to multiple organs, including \\nthe liver, bone, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Periorbital \\necchymoses are a sign of orbital bone metastases.

Nephrogenic \\nrests are foci of embryonal cells that are rarely (<1%) found \\nin normal infant kidneys but commonly (25-40%) found \\nin Wilms tumor–bearing kidneys. Although the cause of \\nWilms tumor is unknown, approximately 15-20% of spo-\\nradic tumors have WT1 mutations or deletions. Over 70% \\nof Wilms tumors demonstrate loss of imprinting or loss of \\nheterozygosity at 11p15, leading to overexpression of IGF2, \\nthought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Certain syndromes \\nincluding Beckwith-Wiedemann and W AGR (Wilms tumor, \\naniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and retardation; mutation \\ninvolving 11p13 region) are at increased risk of developing  \\nthe disease.\\nWilms tumor is the most common malignant renal tumor \\nof childhood, with approximately 500 new cases per year in the \\nUnited States. Unilateral tumors have a median age of diagnosis \\nof 44 months versus bilateral tumors, which have a median age \\nof diagnosis of 31 months.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft  \\ntissue sarcoma in children, is derived from mesenchymal cells \\nof muscle lineage. Less common soft tissue sarcomas include \\nfibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and extraosseous Ewing \\nsarcoma. The most common malignant bone cancers in children \\nare osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcomas derive \\nfrom primitive bone-forming mesenchymal stem cells. Ewing \\nsarcomas are thought to be of neural crest cell origin.\\nETIOLOGY\\nThe cause is unknown for most children diagnosed with sarcoma, \\nalthough a few observations have been made regarding risks. \\nIndividuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (associated with a \\ngermline p53 mutation) and neurofibromatosis (associated with \\nNF1 mutations) have an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas. \\nThere is a 500-fold increased risk for osteosarcoma for individu-\\nals with hereditary retinoblastoma. Prior treatment for childhood \\ncancer with radiation therapy or chemotherapy (specifically \\nalkylating agents), or both, increases the risk for osteosarcoma \\nas a second malignancy.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nIn the United States, 850-900 children and adolescents under \\n20 years of age are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas each \\nyear; approximately 350 are RMS. The incidence of RMS peaks \\nin children 2-6 years old and again in adolescents. The early \\npeak is associated with tumors in the genitourinary region, \\nhead, and neck; the later peak is associated with tumors in \\nthe extremities, trunk, and male genitourinary tract. Boys are \\naffected 1.5 times more often than girls. Of the 650-700  U .S. \\nchildren and adolescents under 20 years of age diagnosed \\nwith bone tumors each year, approximately two thirds have \\nosteosarcoma and one third have Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcoma \\nmost commonly affects adolescents; the peak incidence occurs \\nduring the period of maximum growth velocity. The incidence \\nof Ewing sarcoma peaks between ages 10 and 20 years but may \\noccur at any age. Ewing sarcoma primarily affects whites; it \\nrarely occurs in African American children or Asian children.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nLABORATORY/IMAGING STUDIES\\nAn abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan \\ncan usually distinguish an intrarenal mass from a mass arising \\nfrom the adrenal gland (most commonly neuroblastoma) or \\nother surrounding structures. Evaluation of the inferior vena \\ncava is crucial because the tumor may extend from the kidney \\ninto the vena cava. The diagnostic work-up includes a complete \\nblood count, urinalysis, liver and renal function studies, as well \\nas a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for \\nmetastatic involvement (pulmonary involvement is the most \\ncommon metastatic site). The diagnosis is confirmed by his-\\ntological examination of the tumor.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of Wilms tumor includes hydro-\\nnephrosis and polycystic disease of the kidney; benign renal \\ntumors, such as mesoblastic nephroma and hamartoma; and \\nother malignant tumors, such as neuroblastoma, renal cell \\ncarcinoma, lymphoma, and retroperitoneal rhabdomyosarcoma.\\nTREATMENT\\nThe timing of nephrectomy for unilateral, resectable Wilms \\ntumor remains divided between the North American approach \\nand the European approach. Both approaches have a similar \\noverall survival. The North American approach recommends \\nan upfront nephrectomy (confirming tissue diagnosis) followed \\nby adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, \\nwhereas the European approach is to make a diagnosis relying \\npredominantly on imaging (sometimes a biopsy), provide \\nupfront (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy, then nephrectomy of the \\ninvolved kidney followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with or \\nwithout radiation therapy. The Children’s Oncology Group \\n(North American approach) relies on stage, histology (favorable \\nversus anaplastic/unfavorable), patient age, tumor weight, loss \\nof heterozygosity of 1p and 16q, and imaging response of \\npulmonary nodules after initial chemotherapy to risk stratify \\npatients. Most patients will receive a 2-3 drug chemotherapy \\nregimen (vincristine, actinomycin, with or without doxorubicin) \\nas well as radiation therapy for those with high-risk features. \\nPatients designated with very-low-risk unilateral Wilms tumor \\ncan often be cured with nephrectomy only.\\nBilateral Wilms tumor is present in about 5% of children \\non initial presentation. The treatment goal for patients with \\nbilateral Wilms tumor is to balance the need to achieve \\na cure while retaining as much normal kidney function as  \\npossible.\\nPROGNOSIS AND COMPLICATIONS\\nThe overall survival rate for Wilms tumor is 90%. Unfor -\\ntunately, 25% of survivors will experience serious chronic \\nhealth conditions. Survivors of Wilms tumor are at risk for \\ncardiomyopathy, scoliosis, hypertension and prehypertension, \\nrenal and bladder insufficiency, pulmonary dysfunction, hepatic \\ndysfunction, infertility, and second malignancies. Patients with \\nbilateral Wilms tumor are sometimes left with renal insuf-\\nficiency or failure.

Osteosarcoma tends to metastasize to the \\nlungs, most commonly, and rarely to other bones. Metastatic \\nevaluation includes a chest CT scan and a bone scan (or  \\nPET scan).\\nThe diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma is established with immu-\\nnohistochemical analysis along with cytogenetic and molecular \\ndiagnostic studies of the biopsy material. Ewing sarcoma is \\ncharacterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(11;22), \\nwhich is seen in 95% of tumors. MRI of the primary lesion \\nshould be performed to delineate extent of the lesion and any \\nassociated soft tissue mass. Metastatic evaluation involves a \\nPET scan (when available), chest CT scan, and bilateral bone \\nmarrow aspiration/biopsy.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPatients with Ewing sarcoma may be misdiagnosed as having \\nosteomyelitis; children with osteogenic sarcoma are often \\ninitially believed to have pain and swelling related to trauma. \\nThe differential diagnosis for RMS depends on the location of \\nthe tumor. Tumors of the trunk and extremities often present \\nas a painless mass and may initially be thought to be benign \\ntumors. Head and neck RMS may be misdiagnosed as aller -\\ngies, orbital cellulitis, or chronic infection of ears or sinuses. \\nThe differential diagnosis for intraabdominal RMS includes \\nother abdominal malignancies, such as Wilms tumor and  \\nneuroblastoma.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreatment of RMS is currently based on a staging system that \\nincorporates a number of diagnostic features including primary \\nsite, histological subtype, FOXO1 fusion status, stage (local, \\nregional or metastatic involvement), and surgical grouping (the \\nability or inability to achieve a gross total resection prior to \\nchemotherapy/radiation). The most common chemotherapy \\nagents used in RMS are vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclo -\\nphosphamide. Other active agents include irinotecan, ifosfamide, \\nand etoposide. The use of temsirolimus, temozolomide, and \\nganitumab (anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody) is currently \\nunder investigation. Radiation is administered to the primary \\ntumor when surgical resection is incomplete or would be morbid. \\nIt may also be administered to involved regional nodal sites, \\nand sometimes to distant metastatic sites.\\nThe current treatment of osteosarcoma involves neoadjuvant \\nchemotherapy, surgical resection of the primary tumor, followed \\nby adjuvant chemotherapy. The most common chemotherapy \\nagents used for osteosarcoma are high-dose methotrexate, \\ndoxorubicin, and cisplatin. Radiation therapy is ineffective \\nfor osteosarcoma, although it is sometimes used for palliative \\nintent to treat pain. The treatment for Ewing sarcoma is similar \\nto osteosarcoma and requires neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local \\ncontrol measures, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The most \\ncommon chemotherapy agents used for Ewing sarcoma are \\nvincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide in combination \\nwith ifosfamide and etoposide. The addition of topotecan in \\nnonmetastatic patients and ganitumab in metastatic patients \\nis currently under investigation. In contrast to osteosarcoma, \\nEwing sarcoma is radiation sensitive, and radiation therapy is \\nadministered to patients where the primary tumor cannot be \\nsafely resected as well as for metastatic sites.\\nThe clinical presentation of RMS varies, depending on the site \\nof origin, subsequent mass effect, and presence of metastatic \\ndisease. Periorbital swelling, proptosis, and limitation of extra-\\nocular motion may be seen with an orbital tumor. Nasal mass, \\nchronic otitis media, ear discharge, dysphagia, neck mass, and \\ncranial nerve involvement may be noted with tumors in other \\nhead and neck sites. Urethral or vaginal masses, paratesticular \\nswelling, hematuria, and urinary frequency or retention may \\nbe noted with tumors in the genitourinary tract. Trunk or \\nextremity lesions tend to present as rapidly growing masses \\nthat may or may not be painful. If there is metastatic disease \\nto bone or bone marrow, limb pain and evidence of marrow \\nfailure may be present.\\nOsteosarcoma is often located at the epiphysis or metaphysis \\nof long bones that are associated with maximum growth velocity \\n(distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus), but any bone \\nmay be involved. It presents with pain and may be associated \\nwith a palpable mass. Because the pain and swelling often are \\ninitially thought to be related to trauma, radiographs of the \\naffected region are frequently obtained; the radiographs usually \\nreveal a lytic lesion, sometimes associated with calcification \\nin the soft tissue surrounding the lesion. Although 75-80% of \\npatients with osteosarcoma have apparently localized disease at \\ndiagnosis, most patients are believed to have micrometastatic \\ndisease as well.\\nAlthough Ewing sarcoma can occur in almost any bone in \\nthe body, the femur and pelvis are the most common sites. \\nIn addition to local pain and swelling, clinical manifestations \\nmay include constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, \\nand weight loss.\\nLABORATORY/IMAGING STUDIES\\nTissue biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis of sarcoma. \\nSelection of the biopsy site is important and has implications \\nfor future surgical resection and radiation therapy. Under light \\nmicroscopy, RMS and Ewing sarcoma appear as small, round, \\nblue cell tumors. Osteosarcomas are distinguishable by the \\npresence of osteoid.\\nImmunohistochemical staining for muscle-specific proteins, \\nsuch as actin and myosin, helps confirm the diagnosis of RMS. \\nTwo major histological variants exist for RMS: embryonal and \\nalveolar. The embryonal (ERMS; embryonal RMS) histologi-\\ncal variant is most common in younger children with head, \\nneck, and genitourinary primary tumors. The alveolar (ARMS; \\nalveolar RMS) histological variant occurs in older patients and \\nis seen most commonly in trunk and extremity tumors. Alveolar \\nRMS is often characterized by specific translocations: t(2;13) or \\nt(1;13). Although histology is still used to determine risk group \\nassignment/treatment, FOXO1 fusion status is more predictive \\nof outcome. The vast majority of ARMS are PAX3-FOXO1 or \\nPAX7-FOXO1 translocation positive. Metastatic evaluation for \\npatients with RMS should include positron emission tomography \\n(PET) scan (when available), chest computed tomography \\n(CT), and bilateral bone marrow aspiration/biopsy. A lumbar \\npuncture is required in patients with a parameningeal primary \\nsite due to the risk of direct extension into the central nervous  \\nsystem (CNS).\\nThe diagnosis of osteosarcoma is established with the \\npresence of osteoid and immunohistochemical analysis of \\nthe biopsy material. The extent of the primary tumor should \\nbe delineated carefully with magnetic resonance imaging \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Patel |  J ohn D. Mahan\\nCHAPTER 161 \\nNephrology and Urology \\nAssessment\\nThe kidneys preserve homeostasis through (1) maintaining \\nfluid and electrolyte balance; (2) excreting metabolic waste \\nproducts through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; \\n(3) generating energy (gluconeogenesis); and (4) producing \\nimportant endocrine hormones (renin, vitamin D metabolites, \\nerythropoietin). Renal disorders, by disturbing homeostasis, \\ncan affect growth and development and cause a variety of clinical \\nmanifestations (Table 161.1). Renal disorders in children may \\nbe intrinsic renal diseases or derive from systemic conditions \\n(Table 161.2).\\nHISTORY\\nFetal urine production contributes to amniotic fluid volume, \\nlung maturation, and somatic development. Congenital renal \\ndisorders may be associated with reduced (oligohydramnios) \\nor increased amniotic fluid volume (polyhydramnios). Pulmo-\\nnary hypoplasia and fetal maldevelopment of the face and \\nextremities may result from insufficient amniotic fluid (Potter \\nsyndrome; see Chapters 58 and 60).\\nRisk factors for renal disease (e.g., perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, \\nacute tubular necrosis, renal vein thrombosis) can often be \\ndetected by a careful history. A detailed family history may \\nidentify hereditary renal conditions. Poor growth and/or feeding \\nand abnormal fluid intake and/or output may indicate underlying \\nrenal dysfunction. Common manifestations of renal and urinary \\ntract disorders are listed in Table 161.1.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nRenal diseases in children may be initially asymptomatic and \\ndetected during routine visits. Abnormal growth, hypertension \\n(HTN), dehydration, or edema may suggest underlying renal \\ndisease (see Chapter 33). Abnormal facial features may suggest \\nsyndromes associated with renal disorders (fetal alcohol syn -\\ndrome, Down syndrome). Preauricular tags, external ear \\ndeformities, or ophthalmological abnormalities (keratoconus, \\naniridia, iridocyclitis, cataracts) can be associated with congenital \\nrenal defects. Abdominal examination may reveal renal masses \\nor bladder distention due to urine-concentrating defect or \\nurinary tract obstruction.\\nRENAL PHYSIOLOGY\\nNormal renal function depends on intact glomerular filtration \\nand tubular function (proximal tubule [PT], loop of Henle , \\nand distal tubule [DT]) to produce urine (Fig. 161.1). Net \\nglomerular pressure favors movement of fluid out of glomerular \\ncapillaries into Bowman’s space. Intraglomerular pressure is \\nregulated by afferent and, particularly, efferent arteriolar tone. \\nRenin is generated by cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, \\nlocated at the base of each glomerulus near the afferent/efferent \\narterioles and DT of that nephron. Renin is released in response \\nto glomerular flow and perfusion.\\nThe PT conducts isosmotic reabsorption (see Fig. 161.1) to \\nreclaim two thirds of filtered volume, sodium, and chloride. \\nGlucose, amino acids, potassium, and phosphate are almost \\ncompletely reabsorbed. Approximately 75% of filtered bicar-\\nbonate is reabsorbed in the PT. When filtered bicarbonate \\nexceeds the PT threshold, it is spilled into the urine. The PT \\nalso secretes compounds such as organic acids, penicillins, and \\nother drugs. The most potent vitamin D analog—1,25(OH)2-\\ncholecalciferol (calcitriol)—is produced by PT cells in response \\nto parathyroid hormone and intracellular calcium/phosphorus  \\nconcentrations.\\nThe loop of Henle is the site of reabsorption of 25% of \\nfiltered sodium chloride (see Fig. 161.1). Active chloride \\ntransport drives the countercurrent multiplier and constructs \\nthe medullary interstitial hypertonic gradient required for \\nurinary concentration.\\nThe DT is composed of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) \\nand collecting ducts (CD). The DCT is water impermeable \\nand contributes to urine dilution by active sodium chloride \\nabsorption. The CD is the primary site of antidiuretic hormone \\n(vasopressin) response, which leads to urine concentration. \\nSodium-potassium and sodium-hydrogen exchange in the CD \\nis regulated by aldosterone. Active hydrogen ion secretion, \\nresponsible for final acidification of the urine, also occurs in \\nthe CD.\\nRenal ammonia production and intraluminal generation \\nof ammonium (NH4\\n+) facilitate urine hydrogen ion excretion. \\nUrinary NH4\\n+ is not easily measured but can be inferred by \\ncalculation of the urinary anion gap. The gap between measured \\nanions and cations largely consists of NH4\\n+. Problems with renal \\nacid excretion or ammonia production decrease the urinary \\nanion gap. A urinary gap of approximately 1  mE q/kg body \\nweight is typical in normal children.\\nMaximum urinary concentrating capacity  in a preterm \\nnewborn (~400 mO sm/L) is less than in a full-term newborn \\n(600-800 mO sm/L), which is less than in older children and \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Neonates can dilute urine similar \\nto adults (75-90 mO sm/L), but because glomerular filtration \\nrate (GFR) is lower, the capacity to excrete a water load is \\nless in infants. GFR reaches adult levels by 1-2 years of age. \\nTubular reabsorption of sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and \\nphosphate and excretion of hydrogen are all reduced in infants \\nrelative to adults. These functions mature independently and \\nat different ages, so a neonate rapidly develops the ability to \\nreabsorb sodium efficiently, but it takes 2 years for bicar-\\nbonate reabsorption to mature. Erythropoietin is secreted \\nby interstitial cells in the renal medulla in response to low \\noxygen delivery and helps regulate bone marrow red blood cell  \\nproduction.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS\\nTABLE 161.1 Common Manifestations of Renal Disease by Age\\nFINDING SIGNIFICANCE\\nNEONATE\\nFlank mass Multicystic dysplasia, UT obstruction (hydronephrosis), polycystic disease, tumor\\nHematuria UTI, acute tubular/cortical necrosis, UT malformation, trauma, renal vein thrombosis\\nAnuria and oliguria Renal agenesis, obstruction, acute tubular necrosis, vascular thrombosis\\nCHILD/ADOLESCENT\\nCola red-colored urineHemoglobinuria (hemolysis), myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), pigmenturia (porphyria, urate, beets, \\ndrugs), hematuria (UTI, GN, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, hypercalciuria, stones)\\nGross hematuria UTI, GN, trauma, benign hematuria, nephrolithiasis, tumor\\nEdema Nephrotic syndrome, GN, acute/chronic renal failure, cardiac/liver disease\\nHypertension Acute GN, acute/chronic renal failure, obstruction, cysts, dysplasia, coarctation of the aorta, renal \\nartery stenosis\\nPolyuria Diabetes mellitus, central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, obstruction, dysplasia, hypokalemia, \\nhypercalcemia, psychogenic polydipsia, sickle disease/trait, polyuric renal failure, diuretic abuse\\nOliguria Dehydration, acute tubular necrosis, acute GN, interstitial nephritis, hemolytic uremic syndrome\\nDysfunctional voiding/urgency Neurogenic bladder, UTI, vaginitis, hypercalciuria, foreign body\\nGN, Glomerulonephritis; UT, Urinary tract; UTI, urinary tract infection.\\nTABLE 161.2 Primary and Systemic Causes of Renal \\nDisease in Children\\nPRIMARY SECONDARY (SYSTEMIC)\\nMinimal change \\nnephrotic syndrome\\nPostinfectious glomerulonephritis\\nFocal segmental \\nglomerulosclerosis\\nIgA nephropathy\\nMembranoproliferative \\nglomerulonephritis\\nHenoch-Schönlein purpura-related \\nnephritis\\nMembranoproliferative \\nglomerulonephritis (related to chronic \\ninfection, liver disease)\\nMembranous \\nnephropathy\\nHemolytic uremic syndrome\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis and \\nother vasculitides\\nCongenital nephrotic \\nsyndrome\\nTubular toxins\\nAlport syndrome Antibiotics\\nIntrinsic tubular disorders Chemotherapeutic agents\\nStructural renal disorders Hemoglobin/myoglobin\\nCongenital urinary tract \\nabnormalities\\nTubular disorders\\nPolycystic kidney disease Cystinosis, oxalosis\\nRenal/urinary tract tumor Galactosemia, hereditary fructose \\nintolerance\\nStones\\nSickle disease/trait\\nTrauma\\nExtrarenal malignancy (leukemia, \\nlymphoma)\\nIg, Immunoglobulin.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nDysuria\\nEnuresis\\nRed Urine and Hematuria\\nRenal disorders can be classified as primary or secondary (due \\nto systemic illnesses; see Table 161.2).

The correlation between creatinine and GFR can \\nbe used to estimate GFR. The revised Schwartz formula is the  \\nfollowing:\\nGFR Ht\\nCrserum\\n= ×0 413.\\n(height in cm; serum creatinine in mg/dL). This formula is \\nmost useful when body habitus and muscle mass are reason -\\nably normal and when renal function is relatively stable. This \\nformula is most accurate in GFR range of 15-75 mL/min per \\n1.73 m2. Values greater than 75 are typically reported as greater \\nthan 75 rather than as a specific number. Creatinine clearance \\n([UCr]V/[PCr]) estimates GFR, but overestimates GFR when renal \\nfunction is decreased.\\nUrinalysis is a useful screen for renal abnormalities. In addi-\\ntion to urine color and turbidity, macroscopic urinalysis uses \\na urine dipstick for pH and the presence of protein, glucose, \\nketones, blood, and leukocytes. Dilute urine may result in a \\nfalse-negative result for protein; false-positive results may occur \\nwith extremely alkaline or concentrated urine or if there is a \\ndelay in reading the test. Dipsticks are exquisitely sensitive to \\npresence of hemoglobin (or myoglobin); there are few false-\\nnegative test results but many false-positive results. Glucose is \\ndetected via glucose oxidase-peroxidase reaction, and leukocytes \\nare detected via leukocyte esterase  reaction. The nitrite test \\nmay detect bacteriuria if the bacteria can reduce nitrate to nitrite \\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\\nLaboratory Studies\\nGFR is measured most accurately by infusion of a substance \\nthat is freely filtered by the glomerulus but not metabolized, \\nreabsorbed, or secreted in or by the tubules. GFR is calculated \\nas follows:\\nGFRU VP= [] []\\nwhere [U] is urine concentration, [P] is serum concentration \\nof a substance (mg/dL) used to measure clearance, and V is \\nurine flow rate (mL/min).\\nBy convention, GFR is corrected to body surface area of \\n1.73 m2 to allow comparison between different-sized individuals. \\nIn a full-term newborn, an uncorrected GFR of 4-5 mL/min \\ncorrects to approximately 40 mL/min per 1.73 m2. GFR increases \\nrapidly during the first 2 years of life until it achieves adult \\nvalues (100-120 mL/min per 1.73 m2). After that, GFR and \\nbody size increase proportionately, so GFR/1.73 m2 remains  \\nstable.\\nPlasma creatinine reflects muscle mass, increases with age, \\nand is used to approximate GFR. Creatinine is also secreted \\nby the PT, resulting in less accurate measurement of GFR \\nwith immature kidneys or with decreased renal function. \\nBlood urea nitrogen  is affected by renal function, but is \\nalso affected by hydration, nutrition, catabolism, and tissue \\nNa+\\nH+\\nH+\\nHCO3– H2O\\nGlu Na+ Cl– (Vasa recta)\\nSEGMENTAL NEPHRON FUNCTION\\nCa++\\nCa++ Na+\\nK+\\nH+\\nNaCl  \\nADH +  ADH –\\nCa++\\nCa++K+Cl–Na+\\nH2O\\nH2OH 2O\\nH2O\\nOA  NaCl  \\nNaCl  \\n1200 1200\\n600\\n300 300 50\\n50 50\\n600 50\\n1200 50\\n300\\n600\\n200\\n100\\n300CORTEX\\nMEDULLA\\nPAPILLA\\nLOOP OF HENLE\\nFIGURE 161.1 Major transport functions of each nephron segment, including representative osmolalities \\nin vasa recta, interstitium, and tubule at different levels within the kidney.

Renal blood flow \\nand glomerular filtration rate are not usually diminished. Edema \\nresults from reduction in effective circulating blood volume and \\nincrease in tubular sodium chloride reabsorption secondary \\nto activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. \\nHypoproteinemia stimulates hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and \\ndiminishes lipoprotein metabolism, leading to elevated serum \\nlipids (cholesterol, triglycerides) and lipoproteins.\\nNS may be primary or secondary (Table 162.1). A child with \\napparent primary NS, prior to renal biopsy, is considered to have \\nidiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Minimal change nephrotic \\nsyndrome (MCNS) is the most common histological form of \\nprimary NS in children. More than 80% of children less than 7 \\nyears of age with NS have MCNS. Children 7-16 years old with \\nNS have a ~50% chance of having MCNS. Males are affected \\nmore frequently than females (2 :  1).\\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) accounts for \\n~10-20% of children with primary NS. It may present like MCNS \\nor with less impressive proteinuria. FSGS may develop from \\nMCNS or represent a separate entity. A circulating factor that \\nincreases glomerular permeability is found in some patients \\nwith FSGS. More than 35% of children with FSGS progress \\nto renal failure.\\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is \\ncharacterized by hypocomplementemia with signs of glomerular \\nrenal disease. MPGN represents 5-15% of children with primary \\nNS, is typically persistent, and has a high likelihood of progres-\\nsion to renal failure over time.\\nMembranous nephropathy represents <5% of children \\nwith primary NS. It is seen most commonly in adolescents \\nand children with systemic infections (hepatitis B, syphilis, \\nmalaria, and toxoplasmosis) or specific medications (gold, \\npenicillamine).\\nCongenital NS presents during the first 2 months of life. \\nThere are two common types. The Finnish type is an autosomal \\nrecessive disorder most common in persons of Scandinavian \\ndescent and is due to a mutation in the nephrin protein \\ncomponent in the glomerular filtration slit. The second type \\nis a heterogeneous group of abnormalities, including diffuse \\nmesangial sclerosis and conditions associated with drugs or \\nand have sufficient urine contact time. False-negative results \\noccur with frequent voiding, low urine bacterial count, urinary \\ntract obstruction, and infection with bacteria unable to generate \\nnitrite. Gross hematuria or prolonged contact (uncircumcised \\nboys) may result in a false-positive nitrite test. Microscopic \\nurinalysis is used to confirm pyuria and hematuria and detect \\ncasts and crystals.\\nProteinuria can be further defined by a spot urine protein/\\ncreatinine (UPr/Cr) in a single urine specimen. This unit-less value \\ncorrelates very well with 24-hour urine protein excretion: spot \\nUPr/Cr approximates 24-hour urine protein/m2 per day (normal \\n<0.20; nephrotic range >2.0 in children).\\nIMAGING STUDIES\\nUltrasound reliably assesses kidney size, determines degree of \\ndilation, and differentiates cortex and medulla. The bladder \\nalso can be visualized. Pulsed Doppler studies assess arterial \\nand venous blood flow and can provide the vascular resistive \\nindex in each kidney.\\nA voiding cystourethrogram involves filling of the bladder \\nto detect vesicoureteral reflux and to evaluate the urethra. \\nComputed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging \\nhave mostly replaced the intravenous pyelogram to evaluate \\nkidney structure and function. Radionuclide studies can define \\nrenal size, scars, and renal function/excretion.\\nCHAPTER 162 \\nNephrotic Syndrome  \\nand Proteinuria\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nSmall amounts of protein are found in urine of healthy children \\n(<4 mg/m2 per hour or UPr/Cr <0.2). Nephrotic proteinuria in \\nchildren is defined as protein >40 mg/m2 per hour or U Pr/Cr \\n>2.0. Proteinuria between these levels is mildly to moderately \\nelevated but not nephrotic.\\nProteinuria may be transient or persistent, asymptomatic \\nor symptomatic, and orthostatic (present in the upright posi-\\ntion but not in the recumbent position) or fixed (present in \\nall positions). Proteinuria may be glomerular (disruptions of \\nthe normal glomerular barrier to protein filtration) or tubular \\n(increased filtration, impaired reabsorption, or secretion of \\nproteins).\\nNephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by persistent \\nheavy proteinuria (mainly albuminuria; >2 g/m2 per 24 hour); \\nhypoproteinemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL); hypercholester-\\nolemia (>250 mg/dL); and edema. Age, race, and geography \\naffect the incidence of NS. Certain human leukocyte antigen \\n(HLA) types (HLA-DR7, HLA-B8, and HLA-B12) are associated \\nwith increased incidence of NS. Increased glomerular perme-\\nability is due to alterations in the normal glomerular cellular \\nand basement membrane barrier that restrict serum protein \\nfiltration. The resultant massive proteinuria leads to decreased \\nserum proteins, especially albumin. Plasma oncotic pressure is \\ndiminished, leading to fluid shifts from vascular to interstitial \\nTABLE 162.1 Primary and Secondary Forms of  \\nNephrotic Syndrome\\nPRIMARY SECONDARY\\nMinimal change nephrotic \\nsyndrome\\nPrimary focal \\nglomerulosclerosis\\nMembranoproliferative \\nglomerulonephritis\\nIdiopathic membranous \\nnephropathy\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\nHenoch-Schönlein purpura, \\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis \\nand other vasculitides\\nChronic infections (hepatitis B, \\nhepatitis C, malaria, human \\nimmunodeficiency virus)\\nAllergic reactions\\nDiabetes\\nAmyloidosis\\nMalignancies\\nCongestive heart failure, \\nconstrictive pericarditis\\nRenal vein thrombosis\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The combination of tubular \\nproteinuria with tubular electrolyte wasting and glycosuria is \\ntermed Fanconi syndrome.\\nGlomerular proteinuria is characterized by a combination \\nof urine large and small molecular weight proteins, variable \\nlevels of proteinuria, and often other evidence of glomerular \\ndisease (hematuria, red blood cell casts, HTN, and renal insuf-\\nficiency). Causes of glomerular proteinuria include glomerular \\ncapillary disruption (hemolytic uremic syndrome, crescentic \\nglomerulonephritis); glomerular capillary immune complex \\ndeposition (poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and lupus \\nnephritis); and altered glomerular capillary permeability (MCNS, \\ncongenital NS).\\nTREATMENT\\nBecause greater than 80% of children less than 13 years of age \\nwith primary NS have steroid-responsive forms (chiefly MCNS), \\nsteroid therapy may be initiated without a renal biopsy if a \\nchild has typical features of NS. Typical therapy for MCNS is \\nprednisone, 2 m g/kg per day (60  m g/m2 per 24 hour, maximum \\n60 m g/day), provided once a day or split into multiple doses. \\nOver 90% of children who respond to steroids do so within 4 \\nweeks. Responders should receive steroids for 12 weeks for \\nbest long-term results. A renal biopsy is indicated for nonre-\\nsponders because steroid resistance decreases the chance that \\nMCNS is the underlying disease. Frequent relapses or steroid \\nresistance may necessitate additional immunosuppressive \\ntherapy.\\nTreatment responses in FSGS are highly variable. Approxi-\\nmately 35% respond to steroid therapy; others may respond \\nto immunosuppressive therapy. MPGN and membranous \\nglomerulonephritis often improve with chronic steroid or \\nimmunosuppressive therapy but do not reliably remit with \\nstandard NS steroid therapy. Aggressive medical therapy of \\nfamilial congenital NS, with early nephrectomy, dialysis, and \\ntransplantation, is the only effective approach to this syndrome.\\nNS edema is treated by restricting salt intake. Severe edema \\nmay require use of loop diuretics. When these therapies do not \\nalleviate severe edema, cautious parenteral administration of \\n25% albumin (0.5-1.0 g/kg in travenously over 1-2 hours) with \\nan intravenous loop diuretic usually results in diuresis. The \\nadministered albumin is excreted rapidly, and thus salt restriction \\nand diuretics must be continued. Significant pleural effusions \\nmay require drainage. Acute HTN is treated with β-blockers \\nor calcium channel blockers. Persistent HTN usually responds \\nto angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nAn increased incidence of serious infections, particularly \\nbacteremia and peritonitis (particularly Streptococcus pneu-\\nmoniae, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella), is due to urinary loss \\nof immunoglobulins and complement. Side effects of steroids \\nare most common in steroid-dependent and frequently relapsing \\npatients. Hypovolemia may result from diarrhea or diuretic \\nuse. Loss of coagulation factors, antithrombin, and plasminogen \\nmay lead to a hypercoagulable state with a risk of thrombo-\\nembolism (TE). Warfarin, Lovenox, low-dose aspirin, or \\ndipyridamole may minimize risk of thrombosis in NS patients \\nwith a history of TE or high risk for TE.

Anorexia, \\nmalaise, and abdominal pain are often present. Blood pressure \\nmay be elevated in up to 25% of children on presentation; \\nacute tubular necrosis and significant hypotension may occur \\nwith sudden decline in serum albumin and significant volume \\ndepletion. Diarrhea (intestinal edema) and respiratory distress \\n(pulmonary edema or pleural effusion) may be present. Typical \\nMCNS is characterized by absence of gross hematuria, renal \\ninsufficiency, hypertension (HTN), and hypocomplementemia.\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\\nProteinuria of 1+ or higher on 2-3 random urine specimens \\nsuggests persistent proteinuria that should be further quantified. \\nA UPr/Cr >0.2 on a first morning specimen excludes orthostatic \\nproteinuria. UPr/Cr >2.0 indicates nephrotic range proteinuria.\\nIn addition to a demonstration of proteinuria, hypercho-\\nlesterolemia, and hypoalbuminemia, routine testing typically \\nincludes a serum C3 complement. A low serum C3 implies a \\nlesion other than MCNS, and a renal biopsy is indicated before \\ntrial of corticosteroid therapy. Microscopic hematuria may be \\npresent in up to 25% of cases of MCNS but does not predict \\nresponse to steroids. Additional laboratory tests, including \\nelectrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, \\nand serum albumin level, are performed based on history and \\nphysical examination features. Renal ultrasound is often useful. \\nBiopsy is performed when MCNS is not suspected.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTransient proteinuria can be seen after vigorous exercise, fever, \\ndehydration, seizures, and adrenergic agonist therapy. Protein-\\nuria usually is mild (UPr/Cr <1), glomerular in origin, and always \\nresolves within a few days. It does not indicate renal disease.\\nPostural (orthostatic) proteinuria is a benign condition \\ndefined by normal protein excretion while recumbent but \\nsignificant proteinuria when upright. It is glomerular in origin, \\nmore common in adolescents and tall, thin individuals, and not \\nassociated with progressive renal disease. Many children with \\northostatic proteinuria continue this process into adulthood.\\nTubular proteinuria is characterized by preponderance of \\nurine low molecular weight proteins and is seen with acute \\ntubular necrosis, pyelonephritis, structural renal disorders, \\npolycystic kidney disease, and tubular toxins such as antibiotics \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

PSGN occurs most frequently in children 2-12 years \\nof age and is more common in boys. Manifestations of PSGN \\nare typical of acute GN and develop 5-21 days (average 10 \\ndays) after streptococcal pharyngitis infections and 4-6 weeks \\nafter impetigo. Acute postinfectious GN presents similar to \\nPSGN following infections with other bacterial and viral \\npathogens. PSGN can develop even in the child treated with \\nantibiotics for the infection. Special attention must be paid to \\nthe blood pressure as hypertension may be severe enough to \\ncause heart failure, seizures, and/or encephalopathy.\\nThe presentation of IgA nephropathy is more variable and \\nmay take the form of acute GN, asymptomatic microscopic \\nhematuria, or recurrent gross hematuria concurrent with an \\nupper respiratory infection (rather than several days later, as \\nwith PSGN). Children with hematuria secondary to systemic \\ndisorders such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis, lupus \\nnephritis, and vasculitis-associated GN typically present with \\nother systemic features of the respective disease.\\nA special form of GN is rapidly progressive glomerulone-\\nphritis (RPGN) that presents with typical features of acute GN \\nwhere renal insufficiency progresses more quickly and severely. \\nRenal biopsy shows glomerular epithelial cell proliferation with \\ncrescents. RPGN may be idiopathic or secondary to any type of \\nGN. Early recognition of RPGN is crucial to prevent progression \\nto end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that occurs without prompt \\ntreatment.\\nAlport syndrome is typically caused by X-linked chromo-\\nsome mutations, but has also been associated with mutations of \\ngenes for type IV collagen, both leading to abnormal glomerular \\nbasement membrane (GBM).

Children with isolated, asymptomatic \\nmicroscopic hematuria may be observed with repeat urinalyses. \\nIf hematuria is persistent, additional evaluation may then be \\nappropriate.\\nTHERAPY\\nTherapy for PSGN is supportive and involves dietary sodium \\nrestriction, diuretics, and antihypertensive agents as needed. \\nAlthough treating the streptococcal infection does not prevent \\nPSGN, antibiotic treatment is still warranted with active \\nstreptococcal infection. Therapies for children with other \\nforms of GN depend on underlying cause and severity. In \\nsome cases, antiinflammatory therapy involving corticosteroids \\nand/or other immunosuppressive agents may be warranted. \\nTreatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors \\nmay reduce proteinuria and glomerular hyperperfusion, but \\nshould be used with caution in the setting of acute kidney  \\ninjury.\\nPROGNOSIS AND PREVENTION\\nPSGN usually has a benign outcome. In typical cases, the gross \\nhematuria, proteinuria, and edema decline quickly (5-10 days). \\nMicroscopic hematuria may persist for months or even years; \\nmembrane disease is typically not progressive and usually has \\nan excellent prognosis.\\nThe presentation of nonglomerular causes of hematuria is \\nmore variable and related to the underlying etiology. Hematuria \\ndue to tubular disorders is usually microscopic and may be \\nassociated with proteinuria, glycosuria, and polyuria. These \\nchildren typically do not have hypertension and develop renal \\ninsufficiency only with more severe disease. Painless gross \\nhematuria may be seen with strenuous exercise, sickle cell \\ntrait/disease, or Wilms tumor. Hematuria may be associated \\nwith pain when due to bleeding from renal cysts or Nutcracker \\nsyndrome (renal vein compression). Gross hematuria following \\ntrauma may signify more severe renal or lower urinary tract \\ninjury. UTI is typically associated with dysuria and urinary \\nfrequency. Urolithiasis may be associated with asymptomatic \\nhematuria or with flank or abdominal pain. Hypercalciuria \\ncan cause both gross and microscopic hematuria and may be \\nassociated with urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria and \\nurinary frequency or may be asymptomatic.\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\\nAll patients with hematuria should have a careful history and \\nphysical (including blood pressure) along with urinalysis includ-\\ning microscopic examination to identify RBCs.

After age 10, acquired renal diseases, such \\nas focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and glomerulonephritis \\n(GN), are more common causes of CKD. Risk of progression \\nto end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is related to the underlying \\ncause and severity of CKD. During puberty, renal function \\nmay deteriorate if the damaged kidneys are not able to grow \\nand adapt to increased demands. CKD is staged to facilitate \\nappropriate evaluation and monitoring (Table 165.4). GFR can be \\nestimated in children using the Schwartz formula (see Chapter \\n161). Most complications of CKD do not manifest until at least \\nstage 3 CKD. In stage 4 CKD, complications become more \\nnumerous and severe. Children with stage 5 CKD (ESRD) are \\ntypically treated with either dialysis or renal transplantation.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe clinical presentation of a child with CKD is related to both \\nunderlying cause and complications of CKD. A child with \\nCAKUT may have polyuria, polydipsia, and recurrent urinary \\ntract infections. A child with glomerular disease may have \\nhematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. Common \\ncomplications of CKD in children are listed in Table 165.5. \\nconcentrate urine as well. With intrinsic tubular injury and \\npostrenal AKI, UA may show mild hematuria and/or proteinuria \\nwith specific gravity 1.015 or less. With glomerular and vascular \\ninjury, hematuria and proteinuria are usually moderate to severe. \\nIn oliguric states, differentiation between prerenal azotemia \\nand acute tubular necrosis may be aided by determining urine \\nosmolality and fractional excretion of sodium (see Table 165.2). \\nRenal ultrasound is often helpful in defining AKI category \\n(see Table 165.2). Renal biopsy is indicated only in select cases.\\nCommon electrolyte abnormalities seen with AKI include \\nhyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and hyper -\\nphosphatemia. These labs may need to be monitored frequently, \\ndepending on initial results and clinical course. A complete blood \\ncount should be obtained as anemia is frequently observed. \\nOther studies may be obtained as clinically indicated.\\nTreatment\\nIn some cases the underlying disorder can be treated. Examples \\ninclude volume repletion in dehydration, stopping an offending \\nnephrotoxic medication, and relieving urinary tract obstruction. \\nIn all cases efforts should be made to limit additional renal \\ninjury (e.g., ensuring adequate renal perfusion and avoiding \\nnephrotoxic medications). Medication dosages should be \\nadjusted for decreased renal function as appropriate.\\nFluid therapy depends on volume status and urine output. \\nIf hypovolemia is present, intravascular volume should be \\nexpanded by intravenous saline administration. If hypervolemia \\nis present, 1-2 m g/kg of furosemide and fluid restriction may \\nbe attempted. If euvolemia is present, total fluid input should \\nbe adjusted to meet the urine output, which may be higher or \\nlower than normal. Assessment of intake and output should be \\naugmented with serial body weight measurements.\\nAKI treatment particularly involves management of potential \\ncomplications. Electrolyte disorders are treated as appropriate. \\nPotassium intake and medications that increase potassium should \\nbe restricted. If hyperkalemia is present, intravenous calcium \\nwill lower the risk of arrhythmia while measures are initiated \\nto shift potassium into cells (bicarbonate, β-agonists, insulin/\\ndextrose) and hasten removal (diuretics, sodium-potassium \\nexchange resins, dialysis). Preferred treatment of hypocalcemia \\ninvolves oral calcium supplementation and calcitriol; intrave-\\nnous (IV) calcium is reserved for severe cases. Hypertension \\nmay be treated with diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and \\nvasodilators. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \\nare usually avoided in the setting of AKI.\\nMajor indications for acute dialysis are listed in Table \\n165.3. Medical therapy may be attempted before initiating \\nrenal replacement therapy. There is no set blood urea nitrogen \\nor creatinine level at which dialysis is started in AKI. Renal \\nreplacement options in children include peritoneal dialysis, \\nhemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The \\nmode is selected based on individual factors.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from AKI depends on etiology, severity, availability \\nof specific treatments, and other patient aspects. Nonoliguric \\nAKI usually recovers well, whereas outcomes with oliguric AKI \\nare more variable.

Living donors are preferred when available. Maintenance \\ndialysis is effective for a child awaiting renal transplantation \\nor when renal transplantation is not possible. Indications for \\nchronic dialysis are given in Table 165.3. Peritoneal dialysis \\nis done at home by the family. Hemodialysis is typically done \\nthree times a week at a dialysis facility.\\nPrognosis\\nChildren with mild CKD (stages 1 and 2) may do well but need \\nto be monitored for progressive loss of kidney function. Children \\nwith stages 3 and 4 CKD have a high likelihood of progressing \\nto ESRD at some point, although the timing can vary. Children \\nwith kidney transplants generally do well, but have to take \\nimmunosuppressive medications associated with a variety of \\nside effects, including infections, nephrotoxicity, cardiovascular \\ncomplications, and increased risk for certain malignancies. \\nUnfortunately, most transplanted kidneys fail over time but \\ncan last for >10-20 years. Children on maintenance dialysis \\nhave the highest morbidity and mortality, especially with longer \\ntime spent on dialysis. Thus the primary goal is to provide a \\nkidney transplant for children with ESRD.\\nCHAPTER 166 \\nHypertension\\nDEFINITION\\nIn children, hypertension (HTN) is defined as blood pressure \\n(BP) greater than 95th percentile for age, gender, and height \\nmeasured on at least three different occasions. The context of \\nBP measurement (e.g., cuff size, pain, anxiety) is important. \\nStaging of HTN is listed in Table 166.1. Hypertensive emergency \\nis defined as severe BP elevation associated with target organ \\ndamage (encephalopathy, heart failure).\\nETIOLOGY\\nPediatric HTN has many causes (Table 166.2) that are either \\nprimary (essential) or secondary. Essential HTN is the most \\ncommon cause of HTN in younger children and adolescents. \\nObese children are more likely to develop essential HTN. \\nSecondary HTN should be suspected with younger age and \\nmore severely elevated BP . Renal disease is the most common \\ncause of secondary HTN in children.\\nMost of these complications are multifactorial in etiology. For \\nexample, factors associated with growth failure include poor \\nnutrition, CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), metabolic \\nacidosis, hormonal abnormalities, and resistance to growth \\nhormone. Anemia results primarily from a failure to produce \\nadequate erythropoietin and iron deficiency. CKD-MBD is \\nusually due to secondary hyperparathyroidism as a result of \\ndiminished renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, hypo-\\ncalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia (from decreased renal \\nexcretion). If prolonged and/or severe, CKD-MBD may lead \\nto rickets and bone deformities. Hypertension and left ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy are common cardiovascular complications. \\nDelayed puberty results from altered gonadotropin secretion \\nand regulation. Learning and school performance may also be \\nimpaired in CKD.\\nTreatment\\nThe management of children with advanced CKD requires a \\nmultidisciplinary team of pediatric practitioners. Adequate \\nnutrition should be provided even if this requires dietary \\nsupplements and tube feedings. In infants, a low-solute formula \\nmay be indicated. Unless a child is oliguric, fluid restriction is \\nnot necessary. Many children with CAKUT require supplemental \\nsalt due to urine sodium wasting. Conversely, children with \\nGN tend to retain sodium and may become hypertensive or \\nedematous if given excess salt. Common treatment consider-\\nations for other CKD complications are given in Table 165.5.\\nMeasures can be taken to preserve kidney function or slow \\nprogression of CKD. Hypertension and proteinuria can be \\ntreated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. \\nPotentially nephrotoxic medications should be avoided when \\nfeasible.

Most VUR \\nresults from congenital incompetence of the ureterovesical (UV) \\njunction, a structure that matures through early childhood. In \\na significant minority of children, structural UV abnormalities \\nexist that never resolve. VUR may be familial; 30-40% of siblings \\nof a child with VUR also have VUR. VUR may also be secondary \\nto distal bladder obstruction or other urinary tract anomalies.\\nVUR exposes the kidney to increased hydrodynamic pressure \\nduring voiding and increases likelihood of renal infection due \\nto incomplete emptying of the ureter and bladder (see Chapter \\n114).

Nuclear renal scanning best identifies renal scars.\\nTREATMENT\\nControversy remains about whether long-term prophylactic \\nantibiotic therapy (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitro -\\nfurantoin) is indicated in mild to moderate VUR. It is optional \\nin this population and may be particularly useful in children \\nwith high-grade VUR and/or recurrent symptomatic UTI. \\nComplications of reflux nephropathy are hypertension and \\nchronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is typically heralded by \\nmild proteinuria and involves development of focal and seg-\\nmental glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial scarring. \\nIndications for surgical repair of VUR are controversial, and \\noptions now include instillation of dextranomer/hyaluronic \\nacid copolymer into the bladder wall (Deflux procedure), which \\nappears to be a very successful, minimally invasive correction \\nof mild to moderate VUR.\\nCHAPTER 168 \\nCongenital and Developmental \\nsingle UTI may result in renal scarring, the incidence is higher \\nin children with recurrent UTIs. Renal dysplasia is associated \\nwith congenital VUR. Because of increasing use of maternal-fetal \\nultrasonography, a number of newborns are now identified \\nwith VUR before UTI has occurred, creating opportunities for \\nearly intervention and prevention strategies. Duplication of the \\nureters, with or without associated ureterocele, may obstruct \\nthe upper collecting system. Often, the ureter draining the lower \\npole of a duplicated renal unit has VUR. Neurogenic bladder is \\naccompanied by VUR in up to 50% of affected children. VUR \\nmay also be due to increased intravesicular pressure when the \\nbladder outlet is obstructed from inflammation of the bladder \\n(cystitis) or by acquired bladder obstruction.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nVUR is most often identified during radiological evaluation \\nfollowing a UTI (see Chapter 114). The younger the patient \\nwith UTI, the more likely VUR is present. No clinical signs \\nreliably differentiate children with UTI with and without VUR.\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES\\nAn imaging study can be performed after initiation of UTI \\ntreatment with no need to wait days or weeks before performing \\nthe test. Renal ultrasound (RUS) is the best study to evaluate \\nthe urinary tract in children. A voiding cystourethrogram \\n(VCUG) or radionuclide cystogram (NCG) is performed to \\ndetect urethral/bladder abnormalities and/or VUR. Recent \\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infants with a \\nfirst UTI between 2 and 24 months of age recommend a VCUG \\nif a RUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings \\nsuggestive of either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy \\nand in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG \\nshould also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile \\nUTI. Although VCUG provides additional anatomical detail, a \\nNCG may detect more children with mild VUR and involves less \\nradiation. An international grading system is useful to describe \\nreflux (Fig. 167.1).

Bilateral renal agenesis  occurs in 1 in 4,000 births. \\nRenal agenesis is a component of Potter syndrome (flat facies, \\nclubfoot, and pulmonary hypoplasia). Any intrauterine UT \\ndisorder that results in little fetal urine and therefore little \\namniotic fluid can lead to Potter syndrome. Unilateral renal \\nagenesis occurs in 1 in 3,000 births and is more common in \\ninfants of diabetic mothers and African Americans. It is \\naccompanied by normal or minimally reduced renal function. \\nThis condition can also be found with vesicoureteral reflux \\n(VUR) and other anomalies of the genital tract, ear, skeletal \\nsystem, and cardiovascular system. Unilateral renal agenesis \\ncan be a component of Turner syndrome, Poland syndrome, \\nor V ACTERL association (vertebral abnormalities, anal atresia, \\ncardiac abnormalities, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal agenesis \\nand dysplasia, and limb defects).\\nRenal hypoplasia/dysplasia refers to kidneys that are \\ncongenitally small, malformed, or both. Many affected children \\nprogress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) over time because of \\nreduced nephron number. The kidneys are often unable to fully \\nreabsorb sodium and water, and these children often require \\nsalt and water supplementation to optimize growth.\\nMulticystic renal dysplasia  (MCD) is due to abnormal \\nnephron development and occurs in 1 in 4,000 births.

Respiratory distress is severe, pneumo-\\nthoraces can occur, and severe pulmonary hypoplasia is fatal. \\nUnilateral renal agenesis may be asymptomatic because the \\nnonaffected kidney undergoes compensatory growth and \\nprovides normal renal function.\\nAutosomal recessive PKD is characterized by marked \\nbilateral renal enlargement. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular \\natrophy progress over time. Kidney failure usually occurs in \\nearly childhood. Hepatic fibrosis is present and may lead to \\nportal HTN. Bile duct ectasia and biliary dysgenesis occur. \\nMany affected infants display flank masses, hepatomegaly, \\npneumothorax, proteinuria, and/or hematuria.\\nAutosomal dominant PKD  typically presents in middle \\nadulthood but may present in infancy or childhood. Infants \\nmay have a clinical picture similar to autosomal recessive PKD, \\nbut older children typically show a pattern similar to that of \\nadults, with large isolated cysts developing over time. The defect \\nmay occur anywhere along the nephron unit. Hepatic cysts \\nare often present, and pancreatic, splenic, and ovarian cysts \\ncan also develop. Cerebral aneurysms may develop, and risk \\nof cerebral hemorrhage depends on size, blood pressure, and \\nfamily history of intracranial hemorrhage.\\nUT obstruction  may be silent but is usually discovered \\nduring prenatal ultrasound or with UTI or flank mass in early \\nchildhood. In a newborn, the most common type of abdomi-\\nnal mass is renal (most commonly ureteropelvic junction  \\nobstruction).\\nDIAGNOSTIC IMAGING\\nRenal ultrasound (RUS) and radionuclide renography (usually \\nwith diuretic administered) are the standard tests for diagnosis \\nof UT obstruction. RUS can identify renal agenesis, hypoplasia, \\ndysplasia, cysts, and/or UT dilation. Obstruction may be sug-\\ngested, but a dilated UT may also result from VUR, ureteral \\nhypoplasia, or neurogenic bladder. A voiding cystourethrogram \\n(VCUG) is usually part of the evaluation. Many boys with \\nposterior urethral valves are identified by prenatal ultrasound. \\nPostnatally, the diagnosis and extent of renal damage are \\nestablished by RUS and VCUG.\\nTREATMENT\\nInfants and children with bilateral dysplasia often require \\nadditional sodium and water due to renal wasting. With MCD, \\nsurgical kidney removal is rarely indicated unless severe HTN \\nor recurrent UTI occurs.\\nTreatment of HTN can prolong maintenance of renal func-\\ntion. General therapy of CKD (see Chapter 165) can improve \\ngrowth and development.\\nUT obstruction often requires drainage or surgical correction. \\nTreatment of posterior urethral valve consists of either primary \\nvalve ablation or diversion (usually via vesicostomy) if ablation \\nis not possible. Ectopic ureters are frequently obstructed; when \\nthis happens, surgical intervention is required.\\nChildren with neurogenic bladder are prone to UTI and \\nrenal impairment from poor urine emptying.

Autosomal recessive PKD \\noccurs in 1 in 10,000-40,000 children and is due to genetic \\ndefects in fibrocystin. Autosomal dominant PKD, due to defects \\nin polycystin 1 or 2, occurs in 1 in 1,000 individuals, making it \\nthe most common inherited kidney disease. Although there is \\nsome overlap clinically, the two conditions differ morphologi-\\ncally. Both may appear in infancy or in older children.

Early in gestation, \\nsevere obstruction results in renal dysplasia. Ureteral obstruction \\nlater in fetal life or after birth results in dilation of the ureter \\nand collecting system, often with subsequent renal parenchymal \\nalterations. An obstructed UT is susceptible to infections, \\nwhich may worsen renal injury. Posterior urethral valves  \\nare the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in \\nmales, present in 1 in 50,000 boys. Parents may note a poor \\nurine stream in affected children. The valves are sail-shaped \\nmembranes that arise from the verumontanum and attach to \\nthe urethral wall. The prostatic urethra becomes dilated, VUR \\nmay be present, and hypertrophied detrusor muscle develops. \\nRenal dilation varies in severity. Renal dysplasia is often present. \\nSevere obstruction may be associated with oligohydramnios, \\nresulting in lethal pulmonary hypoplasia.

For some \\nchildren with IHC, potassium citrate or thiazides are required \\nto minimize stone recurrence. Tamsulosin has been increasingly \\nused with success in older children with distal ureteral stones \\nto promote passage. Lithotripsy or surgery by a pediatric \\nurologist may be required for children with large, infected, or \\nobstructing stones.\\nVOIDING DYSFUNCTION\\nEtiology\\nVoiding difficulties are frequent in preschool age children due \\nto delay in maturation of bladder and micturition pathways. \\nNormal micturition and continence rely on structural UT \\nintegrity, neurological maturation, and coordination between \\nsomatic and autonomic nervous system units, including central \\nnervous system, spinal cord pathways, bladder/urinary sphincter \\npathways, and the autonomic system. Daytime continence is \\nusually achieved before nighttime continence. Most children \\nare dry, day and night, by 4-5 years of age. Nocturnal enuresis \\nis the involuntary loss of urine during sleep. Children with \\nprimary enuresis have never had a prolonged (usually >3 \\nmonths) span of nighttime continence. Up to 10% of 5-year-old \\nchildren have primary enuresis with 15% spontaneous resolution \\nper year. Boys are affected more than girls with increased \\nincidence in families (40% at 6 years of age if one affected \\nparent, 70% if two affected parents). Secondary enuresis involves \\nloss of nighttime control after an extended period of dryness \\nand generally requires evaluation to uncover the cause.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nDysfunctional voiding (DV) may manifest as incontinence, \\nfrequency, urgency, hesitancy, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, \\nor recurrent UTI. Symptoms may vary over time and be associ-\\nated with obvious neurological problems (spinal cord injury, \\nencephalitis), constipation, and/or behavioral problems. DV \\nsymptoms may vary, depending on recent UTI or changes in \\nfamily or school life/stressors. The majority of children with \\nDV are anatomically, neurologically, and psychologically normal.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nEvaluation for DV may be performed at any age, but isolated \\nurinary incontinence in an otherwise normal child is not usually \\nevaluated until 5 years of age. Urinalysis and urine culture \\nshould be done to exclude occult infection and renal disease. \\nChildren with daytime incontinence should undergo renal/\\nbladder ultrasound to exclude structural abnormalities.

In this \\ncondition, the urethral folds fail to fuse completely over the \\nurethral groove, leaving the urethral meatus located ventrally \\nand proximally to its normal position. The ventral foreskin is \\nalso lacking, and the dorsal portion gives the appearance of a \\nhood. Severe hypospadias with undescended testes is a form \\nof ambiguous genitalia. Etiologies include congenital adrenal \\nhyperplasia with masculinization of females or androgen \\ninsensitivity. UT anomalies are uncommon in association with \\nhypospadias. Hypospadias may occur alone, but in severe cases \\ncan be associated with a chordee (a fixed ventral curvature of \\nthe penile shaft). Rarely, when the urethra opens onto the \\nperineum, the chordee is extreme, and the scrotum is bifid and \\nsometimes extends to the dorsal base of the penis.\\nIn 90% of uncircumcised males, the foreskin should be \\nretractable by adolescence. Before this age, the prepuce may \\nnormally be tight and does not need treatment. After this age, \\nthe inability to retract the prepuce is termed phimosis. The \\ncondition may be congenital or the result of inflammation. \\nParaphimosis occurs when the prepuce has been retracted \\nbehind the coronal sulcus, cannot resume its normal position, \\nand causes swelling of the glans or pain.\\nClinical Manifestations and Treatment\\nThe meatal opening in hypospadias may be located anteriorly \\n(on the glans, coronal, or distal third of the shaft); on the middle \\nthird of the shaft; or posteriorly (near the scrotum). Testes are \\nundescended in 10% of boys with hypospadias. Inguinal hernias \\nare common. Males with hypospadias should not be circumcised, \\nparticularly if the meatus is proximal to the glans, as the foreskin \\nmay be necessary for later repair. Most pediatric urologists \\nrepair hypospadias before the patient is 18 months old.\\nPhimosis is rarely symptomatic. Parents should be reassured \\nthat loosening of the prepuce usually occurs during puberty. \\nTreatment, if needed, is topical steroids. If the narrowing is \\nsevere, gentle stretching may be useful. Circumcision is reserved \\nfor the most severe cases. Paraphimosis with venous stasis and \\nedema leads to severe pain. When paraphimosis is discovered \\nearly, reduction of the foreskin may be possible with lubrication. \\nIn some cases, emergent circumcision is needed.\\nDISORDERS AND ABNORMALITIES OF THE \\nSCROTUM AND ITS CONTENTS\\nEtiology\\nUndescended testes (cryptorchidism) are found in ~1% of \\nboys after 1 year of age.

In neonates, cryptor-\\nchidism is more common with shorter gestation (20% in \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nScrotal Pain\\nScrotal Swelling (Painless)\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nScrotal Pain\\nA history of maternal drug use (steroids) and family history \\nare important in the evaluation of a child for apparent crypt -\\norchidism. Whether the testis was ever noted in the scrotum \\nshould be asked. The true undescended testis is found along \\nthe normal embryological path of descent, usually in the pres-\\nence of a patent processus vaginalis. An undescended testis is \\noften associated with an inguinal hernia; it is also subject to \\ntorsion. There is a high incidence of infertility in adulthood. \\nWhen bilateral and untreated, infertility is uniform. There is \\nincreased malignancy risk (five times the normal rate) with \\nundescended testis, usually presenting between the ages of 20 \\nand 30. The risk is greater in untreated males or those with \\nsurgical correction during or after puberty.\\nRetractile testes are normal testes that retract into the inguinal \\ncanal from an exaggerated cremasteric reflex. The diagnosis of \\nretractile testes is likely if testes are palpable in the newborn \\nperiod but not at later examination. Frequently parents describe \\nseeing their son’s testes in his scrotum when he is in the bath \\nand seeing one or both “disappear” when he gets cold.\\nComplications\\nTorsion of the testis is an emergency requiring prompt diagnosis \\nand treatment to save the affected testis. Torsion accounts for \\n40% of cases of acute scrotal pain and swelling and is the major \\ncause of the acute scrotum in boys less than 6 years of age. It \\nis thought to arise from abnormal fixation of the testis to the \\nscrotum. On examination, the testicle is swollen and tender, \\nand the cremasteric reflex is absent. The absence of blood flow \\non nuclear scan or Doppler ultrasound is consistent with torsion.\\nThe differential diagnosis of testicular pain includes trauma, \\nan incarcerated hernia, and torsion of the testicular epididymal \\nappendix. Torsion of the appendix testis is associated with point \\ntenderness over the lesion and minimal swelling. In adolescents, \\nthe differential diagnosis of testicular torsion also must include \\nepididymitis, the most common cause of acute scrotal pain \\nand swelling in older adolescents. Diagnosis is aided by an \\nantecedent history of sexual activity or UTI. Testicular torsion \\nmust be considered as the principal diagnosis when severe \\nacute testicular pain is present.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Some \\nboys have congenital dysplasia in the contralateral descended \\ntestis. Surgical correction at an early age results in greater chance \\nof adult fertility. Administration of human chorionic gonado-\\ntropin causes testosterone release from functioning testes and \\nmay result in descent of retractile testes.\\nOrchidopexy is usually done in the second year of life. Most \\nextraabdominal testes can be brought into the scrotum with \\ncorrection of the associated hernia. If the testis is not palpable, \\nultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging may determine its \\nlocation. The closer the testis is to the internal inguinal ring, \\nthe better the chance of successful orchidopexy.\\nSurgical correction of testicular torsion is called detorsion \\nand fixation of the testis. If performed within 6 hours of torsion, \\nthere is >90% chance of testicular salvage. The contralateral testis \\nusually is fixed to the scrotum to prevent possible torsion. If \\ntorsion of the appendix is found, the necrotic tissue is removed.\\nPEARLS FOR PRACTITIONERS\\nCHAPTER 161\\nNephrology and Urology Assessment\\n• Fetal urine production contributes to amniotic fluid volume, \\nlung maturation, and somatic development; reduced (oli -\\ngohydramnios) or increased amniotic fluid volume (poly -\\nhydramnios) may be a sign of a congenital renal disorder.\\n• Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normally low in newborns \\ninfants (~25 mL/min/1.73 m2), and it takes up to 2 years of \\nage to develop adult levels of GFR (100-120 mL/min/1.73 m2).\\n• The proximal tubule (PT) is responsible for most water and \\nelectrolyte reabsorption; this nephron portion consumes \\n>90 % of renal O 2 and suffers most severe injury with \\nanoxic-ischemic kidney injury (acute tubular necrosis); the \\ninability of PT to maximally reabsorb bicarbonate leads to \\nproximal renal tubular acidosis.\\n• The distal tubule collecting duct (CD) is the primary site \\nof antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) response, which leads \\nto urine concentration; CD sodium-potassium and sodium-\\nhydrogen exchange CD is regulated by aldosterone; abnor-\\nmalities in CD active hydrogen ion secretion lead to distal \\nand/or hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis.\\n• The revised Schwartz formula [GFR = 0.413 × Ht (cm)/\\nserum Cr (mg/dL)] is used to estimate GFR in children.\\nCHAPTER 162\\nNephrotic Syndrome and Proteinuria\\n• Urine protein is best quantified by a spot urine Pr/Cr, with \\nnormal <0.2 and heavy (nephrotic range) proteinuria >2.0; \\nU Pr/Cr 0.2-2.0 indicates mild to moderate proteinuria.\\n• Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by persistent \\nheavy proteinuria (mainly albuminuria; >2 g/m2/24 hr); \\nhypoproteinemia (serum albumin <3.0 g/dL); hypercholes-\\nterolemia (>250 mg/dL); and edema.\\n• Primary forms of NS include minimal change nephrotic \\nsyndrome (MCNS—most common form of childhood NS; \\n>80% of those with NS <7 years old having MCNS), focal \\nglomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative glomeru-\\nlonephritis (MPGN), and membranous glomerulonephritis.\\n• For the child with likely MCNS (presentation between 2 \\nand 12 years of age, no signs of systemic disorder, minimal \\nhematuria, normal GFR, and normal C 3), a corticosteroid \\ntrial is warranted.\\n• Complications of childhood NS include poor growth, \\nhypertension, episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI), serious \\nbacterial infections, episodes of thrombi and thromboemboli, \\nand accelerated atherosclerotic disease.\\nCHAPTER 163\\nGlomerulonephritis and Hematuria\\n• Glomerulonephritis (GN) in children presents with some, \\nbut not necessarily all, of the cardinal features of GN: \\nhematuria, proteinuria, decreased renal function, hyperten-\\nsion, oliguria and/or edema; poststreptococcal GN is most \\ncommon form of acute GN while immunoglobulin (Ig)A \\nnephropathy is most common form of chronic GN in \\nchildren.\\n• Hypocomplementemia (low C 3) characterizes acute post-\\nstreptococcal, postinfectious GN, MPGN, and lupus nephritis; \\nall other causes of GN have normal C 3.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

AKI may \\nbe oliguric (<1 mL/kg/hr in neonates and infants, <0.5 mL/\\nkg/hr in children) or nonoliguric, and can be classified as \\nprerenal (renal hypoperfusion), intrinsic renal (tubular, \\nglomerular, or vascular injury), or postrenal (urinary tract \\nobstruction).\\n• Indications for acute dialysis in children include volume \\noverload, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, severe \\nuremia, certain ingestions and metabolic disorders (e.g., \\nhyperammonemia); indications for chronic dialysis include \\nall of the above as well as poor growth due to CKD and CKD \\nStage 5 due to its significant risks of serious complications.\\n• Complications of CKD in children include poor growth, \\nanemia, CKD-mineral bone disorder (bone deformities, \\nfractures), cardiovascular issues (hypertension, left ventricular \\nhypertrophy), and electrolyte disturbances (Na, K, HCO 3, \\nCa, P).\\nCHAPTER 166\\nHypertension\\n• Hypertension in children (preadolescent and adolescent) is \\nmost frequently essential (primary) with secondary forms \\nless common;

Hormones are defined as circulating \\nmessengers, with action at a distance from the organ (gland) \\nof origin of the hormone. Hormones can be regulated by nerve \\ncells; endocrine agents can serve as neural messengers. There \\nis also a relationship between the endocrine system and the \\nimmune system; autoantibodies may cause an organ to produce \\nan excess or deficiency of a hormone. Manifestations of an \\nendocrine disorder are related to the response of the peripheral \\ntissue to a hormone excess or deficiency.\\nHormone action also may be paracrine (acting on adjacent \\nneighboring cells to the cell of origin of the hormone) or auto-\\ncrine (acting on the cell of origin of the hormone itself); agents \\nacting in these ways are called factors rather than hormones \\n(Fig. 170.1). Hormones generally are regulated in a feedback \\nloop so that the production of a hormone is linked to its effect \\nor its circulating concentration. Endocrine disorders generally \\nmanifest from one of four ways:\\n1. By excess hormone: In Cushing syndrome, there is an excess \\nof glucocorticoid present; if the excess is secondary to \\nautonomous glucocorticoid secretion by the adrenal gland, \\nthe trophic hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) \\nis suppressed.\\n2. By deficient hormone: In glucocorticoid deficiency, the level \\nof cortisol is inadequate; if the deficiency is at the adrenal \\ngland, the trophic hormone is elevated (ACTH).\\n3. B y an abnormal response of end-organ  to hormone: In \\npseudohypoparathyroidism, defects in the gene (GNAS1) \\nencoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein \\n(Gsa) is manifested by elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) \\nlevels in the face of deficient PTH function (PTH resistance).\\n4. By gland enlargement that may have effects as a result of \\nsize rather than function: With a large nonfunctioning \\npituitary adenoma, abnormal visual fields and other neu-\\nrological signs and symptoms result even though no hormone \\nis produced by the tumor.\\nPeptide hormones act through specific cell membrane \\nreceptors; when the hormone is attached to the receptor, the \\ncomplex triggers various intracellular second messengers that \\ncause the biological effects. Peptide hormone receptor number \\nand avidity may be regulated by hormones. Steroid hormones \\nexert their effects by attachment to intranuclear receptors, and \\nthe hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus, where \\nit binds with DNA and leads to further gene activation.\\nThe interpretation of serum hormone levels must be related \\nto their controlling factors. For example, a given value of \\nparathyroid hormone may be normal in a eucalcemic patient \\nbut inadequate in a hypocalcemic patient with partial hypo-\\nparathyroidism or excessive in a hypercalcemic patient with \\nhyperparathyroidism.\\nHYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY AXIS\\nThe hypothalamus controls many endocrine systems, either \\ndirectly or through the pituitary gland. Higher central nervous \\nsystem (CNS) centers control the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic \\nreleasing or inhibiting factors travel through capillaries of the \\npituitary portal system to control the anterior pituitary gland, \\nregulating the hormones specific for the factor (Fig. 170.2). \\nThe pituitary hormones enter the peripheral circulation and \\nexert their effects on target glands, which produce other \\nhormones that feed back to suppress their controlling hypo-\\nthalamic and pituitary hormones. Insulin-like growth factor-1 \\n(IGF-1), growth hormone (GH), cortisol, sex steroids, and \\nthyroxine (T4) all feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary system. \\nProlactin is the only pituitary hormone that is suppressed by \\na hypothalamic factor, dopamine. The hypothalamus is also \\nthe location of vasopressin-secreting axons that either terminate \\nin the posterior pituitary gland and exert their effect via \\nvasopressin secretion from this area or terminate in the \\nEndocrine Paracrine\\nTROPHIC HORMONE\\nAutocrine \\nFIGURE 170.1 Schematic representation of mechanisms of action \\nof hormones and growth factors. Although traditional hormones are \\nformed in endocrine glands and transported to distant sites of action \\nthrough the bloodstream (endocrine mechanism), peptide growth \\nfactors may be produced locally by the target cells themselves (autocrine \\nmodality of action) or by neighboring cells (paracrine action).

The most common type occurring in childhood is type \\n1 DM (T1D), which is caused by autoimmune destruction of \\nthe insulin-producing β cells (islets) of the pancreas, leading \\nto permanent insulin deficiency. Type 2 DM (T2D) results \\nfrom insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency usually \\nin the context of exogenous obesity. The incidence of T1D and \\nT2D in the United States is increasing. Less common types of \\ndiabetes result from genetic defects of the insulin receptor or \\ninherited abnormalities in sensing of ambient glucose concentra-\\ntion by pancreatic β cells (see Table 171.1).\\nDEFINITION\\nA diagnosis of DM is made based on four glucose abnormalities \\nthat may need to be confirmed by repeat testing: (1) Fasting \\nserum glucose concentration ≥126 m g/dL, (2) a random venous \\nplasma glucose ≥200 m g/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, \\n(3) an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a \\n2-hour postprandial serum glucose concentration ≥200 mg/\\ndL, and (4) a HgbA1c ≥6.5%.\\nA patient is considered to have impaired fasting glucose \\nif fasting serum glucose concentration is 100-125  m g/dL or \\nimpaired glucose tolerance if 2-hour plasma glucose following \\nan OGTT is 140-199 m g/dL. Sporadic hyperglycemia can occur \\nin children, usually in the setting of an intercurrent illness. \\nWhen the hyperglycemic episode is clearly related to an illness \\nHypothalamic deficiency leads to a decrease in most \\npituitary hormone secretions but may lead to an increase in \\nprolactin secretion. Destructive lesions of the pituitary gland or \\nhypothalamus are more common in childhood than increased \\npituitary secretion of various hormones. A craniopharyngioma, \\na tumor of the Rathke pouch, may descend into the sella turcica, \\ncausing erosion of the bone and destruction of pituitary and \\nhypothalamic tissue. Acquired hypopituitarism also may result \\nfrom pituitary infections; from infiltration (Langerhans cell \\nhistiocytosis [histiocytosis X], lymphoma, and sarcoidosis); after \\nradiation therapy or trauma to the CNS; and as a consequence \\nof autoimmunity against the pituitary gland.\\nCongenital hypopituitarism can be caused by the absence \\nof hypothalamic-releasing factors. Without hypothalamic \\nstimulation, the pituitary gland does not release its hormones. \\nCongenital defects associated with hypopituitarism range from \\nholoprosencephaly (cyclopia, cebocephaly, orbital hypotelorism) \\nto cleft palate (6% of cases of cleft palate are associated with \\nGH deficiency). Optic nerve hypoplasia, formerly known as \\nseptooptic dysplasia, may result in significant visual impair -\\nment with pendular (“roving”) nystagmus (inability to focus \\non a target) in addition to varying degrees of hypopituitarism. \\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of congenital \\nhypopituitarism may include an ectopic posterior pituitary gland \\nbright spot, the appearance of a pituitary stalk transection, and/\\nor small pituitary gland.\\nTABLE 170.2 Anterior Pituitary Hormone Function Testing\\nRANDOM HORMONE MEASUREMENTS PROVOCATIVE OR OTHER TESTS\\nTARGET HORMONE \\nMEASUREMENT\\nGH (not useful as a random determination \\nexcept in newborns, and in GH resistance or \\nin pituitary gigantism)\\nArginine (a weak stimulus)\\nL-Dopa (useful clinically)\\nInsulin-induced hypoglycemia (a dangerous but \\naccurate test)\\nIGF-1, IGF-BP3 (affected by \\nmalnutrition as well as GH excess)\\nClonidine (useful clinically)\\nGHRH\\n12- to 24-hr integrated GH levels (of questionable \\nutility)\\nACTH (early morning sample useful only if in \\nhigh-normal range)\\nCortisol after insulin-induced hypoglycemia (a \\ndangerous but accurate test)\\n8 A.M. cortisol\\n24-hr urinary free cortisol\\nACTH stimulation test (may differentiate ACTH \\ndeficiency from primary adrenal insufficiency)\\nTSH*\\nLH, FSH*\\nTRH (not commonly performed)\\nGnRH (difficult to interpret in prepubertal subjects)\\nFT4\\nTestosterone/estradiol\\nProlactin (elevated in hypothalamic disease \\nand decreased in pituitary disease)\\nTRH (not commonly performed) None\\n*New supersensitive assays allow determination of abnormally low values found in hypopituitarism.\\nACTH, Adrenocorticotropic hormone; CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; FT 4, free thyroxine; GH, growth hormone; GnRH, \\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone; GHRH, growth hormone-releasing hormone; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-BP3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein \\n3; L-dopa, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine; LH, luteinizing hormone; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Hyperglycemia causes an osmotic \\ndiuresis that is initially compensated for by increased fluid \\nintake. As the hyperglycemia and diuresis worsen, most patients \\nare unable to maintain the large fluid intake and dehydration \\noccurs.

Electrolyte abnormali-\\nties occur through a loss of electrolytes in the urine and \\ntransmembrane alterations resulting from acidosis.

Phosphate depletion also can occur as a \\nresult of the increased renal phosphate excretion required for \\nelimination of excess hydrogen ions. Sodium depletion is also \\ncommon in ketoacidosis resulting from renal losses of sodium \\ncaused by osmotic diuresis and from gastrointestinal losses \\nfrom vomiting (Fig. 171.2).\\nClinical Presentation\\nand HLA DR4) increase the risk of developing T1D, whereas \\nother specific HLA alleles exert a protective effect. More than \\n90% of children with T1D possess HLA DR3 alleles, HLA DR4 \\nalleles, or both. The insulin gene region variable number tandem \\nrepeat on chromosome 11 is also linked to T1D susceptibility. \\nThere is evidence for association, beyond HLA, of more than \\n100 other loci with T1D. Genetic factors do not fully account \\nfor susceptibility to T1D; environmental factors also play  \\na role.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nPolyuria\\nFailure to Thrive\\nHyperglycemia results when insulin secretory capacity becomes \\ninadequate to enhance peripheral glucose uptake and to suppress \\nhepatic and renal glucose production. Insulin deficiency usually \\nfirst causes postprandial hyperglycemia and then fasting \\nhyperglycemia. Ketogenesis is a sign of more complete insulin \\ndeficiency. Lack of suppression of gluconeogenesis and \\nglycogenolysis further exacerbates hyperglycemia, while fatty \\nacid oxidation generates the ketone bodies: β-hydroxybutyrate, \\nacetoacetate, and acetone. Protein stores in muscle and fat stores \\nin adipose tissue are metabolized to provide substrates for \\ngluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation.\\nGlycosuria occurs when the serum glucose concentration \\nexceeds the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption (from \\n160 to 190  m g/dL). Glycosuria causes an osmotic diuresis \\n(including obligate loss of sodium, potassium, and other \\nelectrolytes) leading to dehydration. Polydipsia occurs as the \\npatient attempts to compensate for the excess fluid losses. Weight \\nloss results from the persistent catabolic state and the loss of \\ncalories through glycosuria and ketonuria. The classic presen-\\ntation of T1D includes polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and  \\nweight loss.\\nDIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS\\nIf the clinical features of new-onset T1D are not detected, \\ndiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) will occur. DKA may also occur \\nin patients with known T1D if insulin injections are omitted \\nor during an intercurrent illness when greater insulin require-\\nments are unmet in the presence of elevated concentrations of \\nthe counter-regulatory and stress hormones (glucagon, growth \\nhormone [GH], cortisol, and catecholamines). DKA can be \\nconsidered to be present if (1) the arterial pH is below 7.3, (2) \\nthe serum bicarbonate level is below 15 m Eq/L, and (3) ketones \\nare elevated in serum or urine.\\nPathophysiology\\nIn the absence of adequate insulin secretion, persistent partial \\nhepatic oxidation of fatty acids to ketone bodies occurs. Two \\nof these three ketone bodies are organic acids and lead to \\nmetabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. Lactic acid may \\ncontribute to the acidosis when severe dehydration results in \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAbdominal Pain\\nPolyuria\\nAcidemia\\nHypernatremia\\nPatients with DKA present initially with polyuria, polydipsia, \\nnausea, and vomiting. Abdominal pain occurs frequently and \\ncan mimic an acute abdomen. The abdomen may be tender \\nfrom vomiting or distended secondary to a paralytic ileus. The \\npresence of polyuria, despite a state of clinical dehydration, \\nindicates osmotic diuresis and differentiates patients with DKA \\nfrom patients with gastroenteritis or other gastrointestinal \\ndisorders. Respiratory compensation for acidosis results in \\ntachypnea with deep (Küssmaul) respirations. The fruity odor \\nof acetone frequently can be detected on the patient’s breath. \\nAn altered mental status can occur, ranging from disorientation \\nto coma.\\nLaboratory studies reveal hyperglycemia (serum glucose \\nconcentrations ranging from 200  m g/dL to >1,000 mg/\\ndL). Arterial pH is below 7.30, and the serum bicarbonate \\nconcentration is less than 15  mE q/L. Serum sodium con -\\ncentrations may be elevated, normal, or low, depending on \\nthe balance of sodium and free water losses. The measured \\nserum sodium concentration is artificially low, however, \\nbecause of hyperglycemia. Hyperlipidemia also contributes to \\nthe decrease in measured serum sodium. The level of blood \\nurea nitrogen (BUN) can be elevated with prerenal azotemia \\nsecondary to dehydration. The white blood cell count is usually \\nelevated and can be left-shifted without implying the presence \\nof infection. Fever is unusual and should prompt a search \\nfor infectious sources that may have triggered the episode  \\nof DKA.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A patient already diagnosed with T1D may be restarted \\non the prior doses if they were adequate. For a patient with \\nnew-onset T1D, typical starting total daily doses are approxi -\\nmately 0.5-0.7 U/kg/24 hr for prepubertal patients and \\napproximately 0.7-1 U/kg/24 hr for adolescents, using any \\nnumber of the available insulin combinations. The best and \\nmost common choice for making the transition to SC insulin \\nis to begin by giving injections of fast-acting (bolus) insulin \\n(lispro, aspart, or glulisine insulin) with each meal and long-\\nacting (basal) insulin (glargine or detemir) at bedtime. This \\nregimen of multiple daily injections provides the most flexibility \\nbut requires the patient to administer many injections per day \\nand to count carbohydrates in food. An alternative is a fixed \\nmixed split dosing regimen (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH] \\nand fasting-acting insulin) with two daily injections.\\nExternally worn pumps that provide a continuous SC infusion \\nof fast-acting insulin are available, although not usually used \\nat the very onset of T1D. Insulin pumps provide fast-acting \\ninsulin in small basal amounts continuously every hour and \\nwill provide bolus insulin when instructed. Insulin pumps may \\nbe used by all age groups who are highly motivated to achieve \\ntight control. The absence of SC depot insulin (glargine or \\ndetemir) can increase the risk of DKA.\\nSerum glucose concentrations should be assessed before each \\nmeal, at bedtime, and periodically at 2-3 A.M. to provide informa-\\ntion for adjustment of the regimen. Patients and their families \\nshould begin learning the principles of diabetes care as soon \\nas possible. Demonstration of the ability to administer insulin \\ninjections and test glucose concentrations using a glucose meter \\nis necessary before discharge, as is knowledge of hypoglycemia \\nmanagement. Meal planning is crucial to control glucose in \\nT1D. Nutrition services must be part of the care delivered to \\nthe families from diagnosis.\\nHoneymoon Period\\nIn some patients with new onset of T1D, the β cell mass has \\nnot been completely destroyed. The remaining functional β \\ncells seem to recover function with insulin treatment. When \\nthis occurs, exogenous insulin requirements decrease. This is \\na period of stable blood glucose control, often with nearly \\nnormal glucose concentrations. This phase of the disease, known \\nas the honeymoon period, usually starts in the first weeks  \\nof therapy, often continues for 3-6 months, and can last  \\n2 years.\\nOutpatient Type 1 Diabetes  \\nMellitus Management\\nManagement of T1D in children requires a comprehensive \\napproach with attention to medical, nutritional, and psychosocial \\nissues. Therapeutic strategies should be flexible with the \\nindividual needs of each patient and the family taken into \\naccount. Optimal care involves a team of diabetes professionals, \\nincluding a physician, a diabetes nurse educator, a dietitian, \\nand a social worker or psychologist.\\nGoals\\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial established that \\nintensive insulin therapy, with the goal of maintaining blood \\nshown, potassium should be added to the IV fluids. Potassium \\nreplacement should be given as 50% potassium chloride and \\n50% potassium phosphate at a concentration of 20-40 mEq/L. \\nThis combination provides phosphate for replacement of deficits, \\nbut avoids excess phosphate administration, which may pre -\\ncipitate hypocalcemia. If the serum potassium level is greater \\nthan 6 mEq/L, potassium should not be added to IV fluids \\nuntil the potassium level decreases.\\nMonitoring\\nInitial laboratory measurements should include serum glucose, \\nsodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, \\ncalcium, phosphate, and magnesium concentrations; arterial \\nor venous pH; and a urinalysis. Serum glucose measurement \\nshould be repeated every hour during therapy; electrolyte \\nconcentrations should be repeated every 2-3 hours. Calcium, \\nphosphate, and magnesium concentrations should be measured \\nevery 4-6 hours during therapy. Neurological and mental status \\nshould be assessed at frequent intervals. Any complaints of \\nheadache or deterioration of mental status should prompt rapid \\nevaluation for possible cerebral edema. Indicative symptoms \\ninclude a decreased sensorium, sudden severe headache, vomit-\\ning, change in vital signs (bradycardia, hypertension, apnea), \\na dilated pupil, ophthalmoplegia, or seizure.\\nComplications\\nClinically apparent cerebral edema occurs in 1-5% of cases of \\nDKA. Cerebral edema is the most serious complication of DKA, \\nwith a mortality rate of 20-80%. The pathogenesis of cerebral \\nedema likely involves osmolar shift resulting in fluid accumula-\\ntion in the intracellular compartment and cell swelling. Subclini-\\ncal cerebral edema is common in patients with DKA, but the \\nfactors that exacerbate this process leading to symptomatic \\nbrain swelling and possible cerebral herniation are not clearly \\ndefined. Cerebral edema typically occurs 6-12 hours after therapy \\nfor DKA is begun, often following a period of apparent clinical \\nimprovement. Factors that correlate with increased risk for \\ncerebral edema include higher initial BUN concentration, lower \\ninitial P CO2, failure of the serum sodium concentration to \\nincrease as glucose concentration decreases during treatment, \\nand treatment with bicarbonate.\\nSigns of advanced cerebral edema include obtundation, \\npapilledema, pupillary dilation or inequality, hypertension, \\nbradycardia, and apnea. Treatment involves the rapid use of \\nIV mannitol, endotracheal intubation, and ventilation and \\nmay require the use of a subdural bolt. Other complications \\nof DKA are intracranial thrombosis or infarction, acute kidney \\ninjury with acute renal failure caused by severe dehydration, \\npancreatitis, arrhythmias caused by electrolyte abnormalities, \\npulmonary edema, and bowel ischemia. Peripheral edema \\noccurs commonly 24-48 hours after therapy is initiated and \\nmay be related to residual elevations in antidiuretic hormone \\nand aldosterone.\\nTransition to Outpatient Management\\nWhen the acidosis has been corrected and the patient tolerates \\noral feedings, the IV insulin infusion can be discontinued and \\na regimen of subcutaneous (SC) insulin injections can be initi-\\nated. The first SC insulin dose should be given 30-45 minutes \\nbefore discontinuation of the IV insulin infusion. Further \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Because of the \\nshort duration of action, these are used in combination with \\nlong-acting insulin. Glargine and detemir are insulin analogs \\nwith increased solubility at acidic pH and decreased solubility \\nat physiological pH. They have a duration of greater than 24 \\nhours and act as a basal insulin.\\nNewly diagnosed patients in the honeymoon period may \\nrequire 0.4-0.6 U/kg/24  hr . Prepubertal patients with diabetes \\nlonger than 1-2 years typically require 0.5-1 U /kg/24 h r. During \\nmiddle adolescence when elevated GH concentrations produce \\nrelative insulin resistance, insulin requirements increase by \\n40-50%, and doses of 1-2  U/kg/24 hr are typical.\\nNutrition\\nBalancing the daily meal plan with the dosages of insulin is \\ncrucial for maintaining serum glucose concentrations within \\nthe target range and avoiding hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. \\nThe content and schedule of meals vary according to the type \\nof insulin regimen used. It is recommended that carbohydrates \\ncontribute 50-65% of the total calories, protein 12-20%, and \\nfat <30%. Saturated fat should contribute <10% of the total \\ncaloric intake, and cholesterol intake should be less than \\n300 mg/24 hr. High-fiber content is recommended.\\nPatients using multiple daily injections or the insulin pump \\ncan maintain a more flexible meal schedule with regard to \\nthe timing of meals and the carbohydrate content. These \\npatients give an injection of insulin before or immediately \\nafter each meal with the total dose calculated according to \\nthe carbohydrate content of the meal. Further adjustments in \\nthe dose can be made based on the measured serum glucose \\nconcentration and plans for activity during the day. Children \\nusing a twice-a-day combination of intermediate-acting and \\nfast-acting insulins need to maintain a relatively consistent meal \\nschedule so that carbohydrate absorption and insulin action \\npeaks correspond. A typical meal schedule for a patient using \\nthis type of regimen involves three meals and three snacks \\ndaily. The total carbohydrate content of the meals and snacks \\nshould be kept constant.\\nglucose concentrations as close to normal as possible, can delay \\nthe onset and slow the progression of complications of diabetes \\n(retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy). Attaining this goal \\nusing intensive insulin therapy can increase the risk of hypo-\\nglycemia. The adverse effects of hypoglycemia in young children \\nmay be significant because the immature CNS may be more \\nsusceptible to glycopenia. Although the risk for diabetic \\ncomplications increases with duration of diabetes, there is \\ncontroversy as to whether the increase of risk is slower in the \\nprepubertal years than in adolescence and adulthood.\\nGiven the benefits of stable, near normal blood glucose \\nconcentrations, a goal of HgbA1c <7.5% is set for children of \\nall ages. Preprandial blood glucose target concentrations are \\n90-130 m g/dL and concentrations before bedtime and overnight \\nof 90-150 m g/dL. Goals of therapy need to take into account \\nother individual characteristics, such as a past history of severe \\nhypoglycemia and the abilities of the patient and family.\\nInsulin Regimens\\nMany types of insulin differ in duration of action and time to \\npeak effect (Table 171.2). These insulins can be used in various \\ncombinations, depending on the needs and goals of the indi-\\nvidual patient. The most commonly used regimen is that of \\nmultiple injections of fast-acting insulin given with meals in \\ncombination with long-acting basal insulin given at bedtime. \\nThis regimen provides flexibility but requires administration \\nof many injections per day and will require assistance for young \\nchildren. After the total daily dose of insulin is determined, \\n30-50% is given as long-acting insulin, and the remainder is \\ngiven as fast-acting insulin, divided according to the need for \\ncorrections of high glucose levels and for meals. To correct for \\nhyperglycemia, one can determine the insulin sensitivity using \\nthe 1,800/1,500 rule: dividing 1,800 (or 1,500) by the total daily \\ndose of insulin to determine how many milligrams per deciliter \\nof glucose will decrease with one unit of insulin. The \\ninsulin:carbohydrate ratio is used to calculate insulin for the \\ncarbohydrate content of food; 500 divided by the total daily \\ndose determines the number of grams of carbohydrate that \\nrequires one unit of insulin.\\nInsulin pumps that provide a continuous SC infusion of \\nshort-acting insulin also are available and are being used by \\nTABLE 171.2 Representative Profiles of Insulin\\nINSULIN ONSET PEAK ACTION DURATION\\nVERY SHORT ACTING\\nLispro, aspart, glulisine 5-15 min 30-90 min 3-5 hr\\nSHORT ACTING\\nRegular 30-60 min 2-3 hr 5-8 hr\\nINTERMEDIATE ACTING\\nNeutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (isophane) 2-4 hr 4-10 hr 10-16 hr\\nLONG ACTING\\nGlargine 2-4 hr None 20-24 hr\\nDetemir 2-4 hr 6-14 hr 16-20 hr\\nDegludec 2-4 hr None 24+ hr\\nData from Wolfsdorf JI, ed.

A return of symptoms of \\nhypoglycemia can be exhibited in these patients after 2-3 weeks \\nof strict avoidance of hypoglycemic episodes.\\nSymptoms of hypoglycemia include symptoms resulting from \\nneuroglycopenia (headache, visual changes, confusion, irritabil-\\nity, or seizures) and symptoms resulting from the catecholamine \\nresponse (tremors, tachycardia, diaphoresis, or anxiety). Mild \\nepisodes can be treated with administration of rapidly absorbed \\noral glucose (glucose gel or tablets or fruit juices). More severe \\nepisodes that result in seizures or loss of consciousness at home \\nshould be treated with glucagon injections. IV glucose should \\nbe given in hospital settings.\\nPrognosis\\nLong-term complications of T1D include retinopathy, nephropa-\\nthy, neuropathy, and macrovascular disease. Evidence of organ \\ndamage caused by hyperglycemia is rare in patients with diabetes \\nof less than 5-10 years’ duration; clinically apparent disease \\nrarely occurs before 10-15 years’ duration. Diabetic retinopathy \\nis the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Nephropa-\\nthy eventually occurs in 30-40% and accounts for approximately \\n30% of all new adult cases of end-stage renal disease. Neuropathy \\noccurs in 30-40% of postpubertal patients with T1D and leads \\nto sensory, motor, or autonomic deficits. Macrovascular disease \\nresults in an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke \\namong individuals with diabetes.\\nIntensive control of diabetes, using frequent blood glucose \\ntesting, continuous glucose monitoring, and multiple daily \\ninjections of insulin or an insulin pump, can reduce the devel-\\nopment or progression of diabetic complications, including \\na 76% reduction of risk for retinopathy, a 39% reduction in \\nmicroalbuminuria, and a 60% reduction in clinical neuropathy. \\nFor pubertal and adult patients, the benefits of intensive therapy \\nlikely outweigh the increased risk for hypoglycemia. For younger \\npatients, in whom the risks for hypoglycemia are greater and the \\nbenefits of tight glucose control may be lower, a less intensive \\nregimen may be appropriate.\\nTYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS\\nPathophysiology\\nT2D can occur as the result of various pathophysiological \\nprocesses; however, the most common form results from \\nperipheral insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsu-\\nlinemia, followed by failure of the pancreas to maintain adequate \\ninsulin secretion (see Table 171.1).\\nEpidemiology\\nThe prevalence of T2D in children is increasing in parallel with \\nchildhood obesity and is highest in children of ethnic groups \\nwith a high prevalence of T2D in adults, including Native \\nBlood Glucose Testing\\nBlood glucose should be routinely monitored before each meal \\nand at bedtime. Hypoglycemia during the night or excessive \\nvariability in the morning glucose concentrations should prompt \\nadditional testing at 2 or 3 A.M. to ensure that there is no \\nconsistent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. During periods of \\nillness or when blood glucose concentrations are higher than \\n300 m g/dL, urine ketones also should be tested. Continuous \\nglucose monitors, which provide minute-to-minute blood \\nglucose concentration information, can be useful in following \\ntrends of blood glucose concentrations, but should not be used \\nin calculations of mealtime insulin doses.\\nLong-Term Glycemic Control\\nMeasurements of glycohemoglobin or hemoglobin A 1c \\n(HgbA1c) reflect the average blood glucose concentration over \\nthe preceding 3 months and provide a means for assessing \\nlong-term glycemic control. HgbA1c should be measured four \\ntimes a year, and the results should be used for counseling of \\npatients. The American Diabetes Association has set HgbA1c \\ntargets for children at <7.5%. Measurements of HgbA1c are \\ninaccurate in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Glycosylated \\nalbumin or fructosamine can be used in these cases.\\nComplications\\nPatients with T1D for more than 3-5 years should receive an \\nannual ophthalmological examination for retinopathy. Urine \\nshould be collected annually for assessment of microalbuminuria, \\nwhich suggests early renal dysfunction and indicates a high \\nrisk of progression to nephropathy. Treatment with angiotensin-\\nconverting enzyme inhibitors may halt the progression of \\nmicroalbuminuria. In children with T1D, annual cholesterol \\nmeasurements and periodic assessment of blood pressure are \\nrecommended. Early detection of hypertension and hypercho-\\nlesterolemia with appropriate intervention can help limit future \\nrisk of coronary disease.\\nOther Disorders\\nChronic autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis is particularly \\ncommon and can result in hypothyroidism. Because symptoms \\ncan be subtle, thyroid function tests should be performed \\nannually. Other disorders that occur with increased frequency \\nin children with T1D include celiac disease, immunoglobulin \\nA deficiency, Addison disease, and peptic ulcer disease.\\nSpecial Problems: Hypoglycemia\\nHypoglycemia occurs commonly in patients with T1D. \\nFor patients in adequate or better control, it is expected to \\noccur on average once or twice a week. Severe episodes of \\nhypoglycemia, resulting in seizures or coma or requiring assis-\\ntance from another person, occur in 10-25% of these patients  \\nper year.\\nHypoglycemia in patients with T1D results from a relative \\nexcess of insulin in relation to the serum glucose concentration. \\nThis excess can be caused by alterations in the dose, timing, \\nor absorption of insulin; alterations of carbohydrate intake; or \\nchanges in insulin sensitivity resulting from activity.

Insulin resistance does not occur in \\nthese patients; instead, the primary abnormality is an insuf-\\nficient insulin secretory response to glycemic stimulation. \\nTreatment depends on the type and can include the use of  \\nsulfonylureas.\\nCHAPTER 172 \\nHypoglycemia\\nHypoglycemia in infancy and childhood can result from a large \\nvariety of hormonal and metabolic defects (Table 172.1). \\nHypoglycemia occurs most frequently in the early neonatal \\nperiod, often as a result of transient neonatal hyperinsulinemia \\nin infants of diabetic mothers or as a result of inadequate energy \\nstores to meet the disproportionately large metabolic needs of \\npremature or small for gestational age newborns. Hypoglycemia \\nduring the first few days of life in an otherwise normal newborn \\nis less frequent and warrants concern (see Chapter 6). After \\nthe initial 2-3 days of life, hypoglycemia is far less common \\nand is more frequently the result of endocrine or metabolic \\ndisorders (although sepsis must always be ruled out).\\nDEFINITION\\nClinical hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose (PG) \\nconcentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs of \\nimpaired brain function. Brain glucose utilization is reduced \\nat a PG concentration of approximately 55-65  m g/dL. Auto-\\nnomic system (neurogenic) symptoms are perceived at a PG \\nconcentration <55 m g/dL. Cognitive function is impaired \\n(neuroglycopenia) at a PG concentration <50 mg/dL (Table \\n172.2).\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAmericans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans. \\nObesity, the metabolic syndrome, ethnicity, and a family history \\nof T2D are risk factors. Autoantibodies to the pancreas are \\npresent among some clinically assumed to have T2D, compound-\\ning the difficulty in differentiating T1D from T2D at the time \\nof diagnosis.\\nClinical Manifestations and  \\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nFasting and postprandial glucose levels for diagnosis of T2D \\nare the same as those for T1D. The diagnosis of T2D may be \\nsuspected on the basis of polyuria and polydipsia in a back-\\nground of the metabolic syndrome. Differentiating T2D from \\nT1D in children on only clinical grounds can be challenging. \\nThe possibility of T2D should be considered in patients who \\nare obese, have a strong family history of T2D, have other \\ncharacteristics of the metabolic syndrome, or have absence of \\nantibodies to β cell antigens at the time of diagnosis of diabetes. \\nAcanthosis nigricans, a dermatological manifestation of \\nhyperinsulinism and insulin resistance, presents as hyperkera-\\ntotic pigmentation in the nape of the neck and in flexural areas \\nand is noted as a sign in the metabolic syndrome. Although \\nketoacidosis occurs far more commonly in T1D, it also can \\noccur in patients with T2D under conditions of physiological \\nstress and cannot be used as an absolute differentiating factor. \\nT2D can be confirmed by the evaluation of insulin or C-peptide \\nresponses to stimulation with oral carbohydrate and in the \\nabsence of islet cell autoreactivity.\\nTherapy\\nT2D is the result of a combination of insulin resistance, relative \\ninsulin deficiency, and a secretory β cell defect. Asymptomatic \\npatients with mildly elevated glucose values (slightly >126 mg/\\ndL for fasting or slightly >200 m g/dL for random glucose) may \\nbe managed initially with lifestyle modifications, including \\nnutrition therapy (dietary adjustments) and increased exercise. \\nExercise has been shown to decrease insulin resistance. In most \\nchildren with new-onset, uncomplicated T2D, oral agents are \\nusually the first line of therapy. Only metformin, an insulin \\nsecretagogue, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\\nistration for use in children. A rare side effect of metformin is \\nlactic acidosis, occurring mainly in patients with compromised \\nrenal function. The most common side effect is gastrointestinal \\nupset. If ketonuria or ketoacidosis occurs, insulin treatment is \\nnecessary to first achieve adequate glycemic control, but may \\nbe discontinued within weeks with continuation of oral medica-\\ntions.

In these infants, \\nhyperplasia of the pancreatic islet cells develops in the absence \\nof excess stimulation by maternal diabetes. There are currently \\n11 genes associated with monogenic forms of hyperinsulin-\\nism (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH1, UCP2, MCT1, \\nHNF4A, HNF1A, HK1, PGM1) , as well as several syndromic \\ngenetic forms of HI (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann, Kabuki, and \\nTurner syndromes). The most common causes for congenital \\nhyperinsulinism involve inactivating KATP channel mutations \\nand account for approximately 60% of all identifiable mutations. \\nHyperinsulinism also can occur in Beckwith-Wiedemann syn-\\ndrome (a condition characterized by neonatal somatic gigantism, \\nmacrosomia, macroglossia, omphalocele, visceromegaly, and \\nearlobe creases).\\nRegardless of the cause, neonates with hyperinsulinism are \\ncharacteristically large for gestational age (see Chapter 60). \\nHypoglycemia is severe and frequently occurs within 1-3 hours \\nof a feeding. Glucose requirements are increased, often two to \\nthree times the normal basal glucose requirement of 6-8 m g/kg/\\nmin. The diagnosis of hyperinsulinism in children is determined \\nby evaluating markers of inappropriate insulin effects (e.g., sup-\\npressed ketogenesis) because plasma insulin concentrations are \\nfrequently not clearly elevated. Diagnosis is most reliably based \\non a closely monitored provocative fasting test that includes \\n(1) frequent sampling of plasma concentrations of glucose, \\ninsulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, and FFAs and (2) terminating the \\ntest when glucose concentrations decline toward 50 m g/dL with a \\ndetermination of the glycemic response to glucagon. The absence \\nof serum and urine ketones at the time of hypoglycemia is an \\nimportant diagnostic feature, distinguishing hyperinsulinism \\nfrom defects in counter-regulatory hormone secretion.\\nTreatment initially involves the infusion of intravenous \\n(IV) glucose at high rates and of diazoxide to suppress insulin \\nsecretion. If diazoxide therapy is unsuccessful, long-acting \\nsomatostatin analogs can be tried. Often medical therapy for \\npersistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of the newborn is \\nunsuccessful, and subtotal (90%) pancreatectomy is required \\nto prevent long-term neurological sequelae of hypoglycemia.\\nTABLE 172.2 Symptoms and Signs of Hypoglycemia\\nFEATURES ASSOCIATED \\nWITH EPINEPHRINE \\nRELEASE*\\nFEATURES ASSOCIATED \\nWITH CEREBRAL \\nGLYCOPENIA\\nPerspiration Headache\\nPalpitation (tachycardia) Mental confusion\\nPallor Somnolence\\nParesthesia Dysarthria\\nTrembling Personality changes\\nAnxiety Inability to concentrate\\nWeakness Staring\\nNausea Hunger\\nVomiting Convulsions\\nAtaxia\\nComa\\nDiplopia\\nStroke\\n*These features and perceptions of the features may be blunted if the patient \\nis receiving β-blocking agents.\\nAdipose tissue\\nEPI\\nGLUCAGON\\nTG FFA\\nGlycerol\\nGluconeogenesis\\nGlycogenolysis\\nEPI\\nGH\\nCORTISOL\\nGLUCAGON\\nKetogenesis Heart, kidney,\\nmuscle, brain\\nMuscle\\nCORTISOL\\nAmino acids\\n(alanine)\\nLactate\\nInsulin\\n–\\n–\\nInsulin\\n–\\nInsulin\\n–\\nGlucose\\nBrain,\\nblood cells\\nFIGURE 172.1 Regulation of serum glucose. –  represents inhibitions.

Because there are no \\nspecific diagnostic tests for this disorder, ketotic hypoglycemia \\nis a diagnosis of exclusion.\\nTreatment involves avoidance of fasting and frequent feedings \\nof a high-protein, high-carbohydrate diet. Patients may require \\nhospitalization for IV glucose infusion if they cannot maintain \\nadequate oral intake during a period of illness.\\nDISRUPTED METABOLIC  \\nRESPONSE PATHWAYS\\nMaintenance of normal serum glucose concentrations in the \\nfasting state requires glucose production via glycogenolysis and \\ngluconeogenesis and the production of alternative energy sources \\n(FFAs and ketones) via lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation.\\nGlycogenolysis\\nSome glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) occur in a variety of \\nsubtypes that differ in severity (see Chapter 52). Among the \\nsubtypes that result in hypoglycemia, the most severe form is \\nglucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, which is characterized by \\nsevere hypoglycemia, massive hepatomegaly, growth retardation, \\nand lactic acidosis. In contrast, deficiencies in the glycogen \\nphosphorylase enzymes may cause isolated hepatomegaly with \\nor without hypoglycemia.\\nThe diagnosis of GSD is suggested by a finding of hepato -\\nmegaly without splenomegaly (although GSD type 0 is not \\nassociated with hepatomegaly). Confirmation of the diagnosis \\nrequires specific biochemical studies of leukocytes or liver \\nbiopsy specimens. Treatment for the most common types \\ninvolves frequent high-carbohydrate feedings during the day \\nand continuous feedings at night via nasogastric tube. Feedings \\nof uncooked cornstarch overnight are sufficient to maintain \\nserum glucose concentrations in some patients.\\nGluconeogenesis\\nDefects in gluconeogenesis are uncommon and include fructose-\\n1,6-diphosphatase deficiency and phosphoenolpyruvate car-\\nboxykinase deficiency. Affected patients exhibit fasting \\nhypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia. \\nKetosis occurs, and FFA and alanine concentrations are high. \\nTreatment involves frequent high-carbohydrate, low-protein \\nfeedings (see Chapter 52).\\nFatty Acid Oxidation\\nFatty acid oxidation disorders of ketogenesis include the fatty \\nacid acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase deficiencies; \\nlong-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehy-\\ndrogenase deficiencies; and hereditary carnitine deficiency (see \\nChapter 55). Of these disorders, medium-chain acyl-CoA \\ndehydrogenase deficiency is the most common; it occurs in 1 \\nin 4,000-17,000 live births, depending on the population. Patients \\noften are well in infancy and have the first episode of hypo-\\nglycemia at 2 years of age or older. Mild hepatomegaly may be \\npresent along with mild hyperammonemia, hyperuricemia, and \\nmild elevations in hepatic transaminases. Episodes of nonketotic \\nhypoglycemia usually occur with prolonged fasting or during \\nFactitious Hyperinsulinemia\\nIn rare cases, insulin or a hypoglycemic medication is admin-\\nistered by a parent or caregiver to a child as a form of child \\nabuse, which is a condition referred to as Munchausen syndrome \\nby proxy. This diagnosis should be suspected if extremely high \\ninsulin concentrations are detected (>100 µU/mL). C-peptide \\nconcentrations are low or undetectable, which confirms that \\nthe insulin is from an exogenous source.\\nDefects in Counter-Regulatory Hormones\\nAbnormalities in the secretion of counter-regulatory hormones \\nthat produce hypoglycemia usually involve GH, cortisol, or \\nboth. Deficiencies in glucagon and epinephrine secretion are \\nrare. GH and cortisol deficiency occur as a result of hypopi-\\ntuitarism. Hypopituitarism results from congenital hypoplasia \\nor aplasia of the pituitary or, more commonly, from deficiency \\nof hypothalamic releasing factors (see Chapter 173). Clues to \\nthis diagnosis in infants include the presence of hypoglycemia \\nin association with midline facial or neurological defects (e.g., \\ncleft lip and palate or absence of the corpus callosum), pendular \\n(roving) nystagmus (indicating visual impairment from possible \\nabnormalities in the development of the optic nerves, which \\ncan occur in optic nerve hypoplasia), and the presence of \\nmicrophallus and cryptorchidism in boys (indicating abnormali-\\nties in gonadotropin secretion). Jaundice and hepatomegaly \\nalso can occur, simulating neonatal hepatitis. Despite the \\npresence of GH deficiency, these infants are usually of normal \\nsize at birth.\\nDeficient cortisol secretion also can occur in primary adrenal \\ninsufficiency, resulting from a variety of causes. In infants it often \\nresults from congenital adrenal hyperplasia, most frequently \\nas a result of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (see Chapters 177 and \\n178). In older children, primary adrenal insufficiency is seen \\nmost frequently in Addison disease and other disorders (see \\nChapter 178).\\nConfirmation of GH or cortisol deficiency as the cause of \\nhypoglycemia requires the detection of low serum GH and \\ncortisol concentrations during an episode of hypoglycemia or \\nafter other stimulatory testing. In contrast to hyperinsulinism, \\nserum and urine ketones are positive at the time of hypoglycemia \\nand FFAs are elevated. Treatment involves supplementation of \\nthe deficient hormones in physiological doses.\\nENERGY STORES\\nSufficient energy stores in the form of glycogen, adipose tissue, \\nand muscle are necessary to respond appropriately to hypo-\\nglycemia. Deficiencies in these stores are a common cause of \\nhypoglycemia in neonates who are small for gestational age or \\npremature (see Chapter 60). Beyond the early neonatal period, \\nenergy stores are usually sufficient to meet the metabolic \\nrequirements except in malnourished children.\\nIDIOPATHIC KETOTIC HYPOGLYCEMIA\\nA common cause of new-onset hypoglycemia is idiopathic \\nketotic hypoglycemia, usually seen in children between 18 \\nmonths and remits by 8 years of age. Patients have symptoms \\nof hypoglycemia after a period of prolonged fasting, often in \\nthe setting of an intercurrent illness with decreased feeding. \\nChildren with this disorder are often thin and small and may \\nhave a history of being small for gestational age.

After the initial bolus, an infusion of IV glucose \\nshould provide approximately 1.5 times the normal hepatic \\nglucose production rate (8-12 m g/kg/min in infants, 6-8  m g/\\nkg/min in children). This infusion allows for suppression of \\nthe catabolic state and prevents further decompensation in \\npatients with certain metabolic disorders. If adrenal insuffi-\\nciency is suspected, stress doses of glucocorticoids should be  \\nadministered.\\nCHAPTER 173 \\nShort Stature\\nGROWTH\\nNormal growth is the final common pathway of many factors, \\nincluding endocrine, environmental, nutritional, and genetic \\ninfluences (see Chapter 5). A normal linear growth pattern is \\ngood evidence of overall health and can be considered a bioassay \\nfor the well-being of the whole child. The effects of certain \\nhormones on growth and ultimate height are listed in Table \\n173.1. Just as various factors influence stature, stature itself \\ninfluences psychological, social, and potentially economic \\nwell-being. Parental concern about the psychosocial conse-\\nquences of abnormal stature often causes a family to seek medical \\nattention.\\nGrowth Hormone Physiology\\nGrowth hormone (GH) secretion is pulsatile, stimulated by \\nhypothalamic GH-releasing factor (GRF), and inhibited by GH \\nrelease inhibitory factor (somatostatin, somatotropin release-\\ninhibiting factor [SRIF]), which interact with their individual \\nreceptors on the pituitary somatotrope in a noncompetitive \\nmanner. GH is also stimulated by a number of factors (e.g., \\nghrelin, sex steroid hormones, clonidine, hypoglycemia, \\nepisodes of intercurrent illness. Treatment involves avoidance \\nof fasting.\\nOTHER METABOLIC DISORDERS\\nMany metabolic disorders can lead to hypoglycemia, including \\ngalactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, and disorders of \\norganic acid metabolism (see Table 172.1). Hypoglycemia in \\nthese disorders is usually a reflection of global hepatic dysfunc-\\ntion secondary to the buildup of hepatotoxic intermediates. \\nMany of these disorders present with low concentrations of \\nketone bodies because ketogenesis also is affected. The finding \\nof non-glucose-reducing substances in the urine after ingestion \\nof offending substances suggests a diagnosis of galactosemia \\nor hereditary fructose intolerance. Treatment requires dietary \\nrestriction of the specific offending substances.\\nMEDICATIONS AND INTOXICATION\\nHypoglycemia can occur as an adverse effect of numerous \\nmedications (see Table 172.1). Ethanol ingestion also can cause \\nhypoglycemia, especially in younger children, because the \\nmetabolism of ethanol results in the depletion of cofactors \\nnecessary for gluconeogenesis.\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAlthough the list of causes of hypoglycemia is long and \\ncomplex, establishing the etiology in a particular patient \\nis important. Frequently it is difficult to make an accurate \\ndiagnosis until one can obtain a critical sample of blood and \\nurine at the time of the hypoglycemic episode. In a child \\nwith unexplained hypoglycemia, a serum sample should be \\nobtained before treatment for the measurement of glucose \\nand insulin, GH, cortisol, FFAs, and β-hydroxybutyrate and \\nacetoacetate. Measurement of serum lactate levels also should be \\nconsidered. A urine specimen should be obtained for measur-\\ning ketones and reducing substances. Hypoglycemia without \\nketonuria suggests hyperinsulinism or a defect in fatty acid \\noxidation. The results of this initial testing can establish whether \\nendocrine causes are responsible and, if not, provide initial \\ninformation regarding which types of metabolic disorders are  \\nmost likely.\\nTABLE 173.1 Hormonal Effects on Growth\\nHORMONE BONE AGE GROWTH RATE ADULT HEIGHT*\\nAndrogen excess Advanced Increased Diminished\\nAndrogen deficiency Normal or delayed Normal or decreased Increased slightly or normal\\nThyroxine excess Advanced Increased Normal or diminished\\nThyroxine deficiency Retarded Decreased Diminished\\nGrowth hormone excess Normal or advanced Increased Excessive\\nGrowth hormone deficiency Retarded Decreased Diminished\\nCortisol excess Retarded Decreased Diminished\\nCortisol deficiency Normal Normal Normal\\n*Effect in most patients with treatment.\\nModified from Underwood LE, Van Wyk JJ.

GH circulates bound to a GH-binding protein (GHBP); \\nGHBP abundance reflects the abundance of GH receptors. \\nGH has direct effects on tissue and also causes production \\nand secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in many \\ntissues. GH stimulates IGF-1 production in the liver along \\nwith production of the acid-labile subunit and the IGF-binding \\nprotein (IGF-BP3); this forms the complex that delivers IGF-1  \\nto tissue.\\nIGF-1 acts primarily as a paracrine and autocrine agent \\nand is most closely associated with postnatal growth. When \\nIGF-1 attaches to its membrane-bound receptor, second mes-\\nsengers are stimulated to change the physiology of the cell \\nand produce growth effects. IGF-1 production is influenced \\nby disease states such as malnutrition, chronic renal and liver \\ndisease, hypothyroidism, or obesity.\\nIGF-BP3 is measurable in clinical assays and is less influenced \\nby nutrition and age than is IGF-1; measuring IGF-1 and \\nIGF-BP3 is useful in evaluating GH adequacy, particularly in \\ninfancy and early childhood.\\nMeasurement of Growth\\nThe correct measurement of an infant’s length requires one \\nadult to hold the infant’s head still and another adult to extend \\nthe feet with the soles perpendicular to the lower legs. A \\ncaliper-like device, such as an infantometer, or the movable \\nplates on an infant scale are used so that the exact distance \\nbetween the two calipers or plates can be determined. Marking \\nthe position of the head and feet of an infant lying on a sheet \\nof paper on the examining table leads to inaccuracies and may \\nmiss true disorders of growth or create false concerns about a \\ndisorder of growth in a normal child. Accurate measurements \\nof height (standing), or length (lying down), and weight should \\nbe plotted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \\ngrowth charts for the timely diagnosis of growth disorders \\n(http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/).\\nAfter 2 years of age, the height of a child should be measured \\nin the standing position. Children measured in the standing \\nposition should be barefoot against a hard surface. A Harpenden \\nstadiometer or equivalent device is optimal for the measurement \\nof stature. A decrease of roughly 1.25 cm in h eight measurement \\nmay occur when the child is measured in the standing position \\nrather than in the lying position, leading to the inappropriate \\nreferral of many children who appear to be not growing to a \\nsubspecialist.\\nMeasurement of the arm span is essential when the diagnoses \\nof Marfan or Klinefelter syndrome, short-limbed dwarfism, \\nor other dysmorphic conditions are considered. Arm span is \\nmeasured as the distance between the tips of the fingers when the \\npatient holds both arms outstretched horizontally while standing \\nagainst a solid surface. The upper-to-lower segment ratio is \\nthe ratio of the upper segment (determined by subtraction \\nof the measurement from the symphysis pubis to the floor \\n[known as the lower segment] from the total height) to the \\nlower segment. This ratio changes with age. A normal term \\ninfant has an upper-to-lower ratio of 1.7  :  1, a 1-y ear-old has \\na ratio of 1.4  :  1, a nd a 10-year-old has a ratio of 1  :  1. C ondi-\\ntions of hypogonadism, not commonly discerned or suspected \\nuntil after the normal age for onset of puberty, lead to greatly \\ndecreased upper-to-lower ratio in an adult, whereas long-lasting \\nand untreated hypothyroidism leads to a high upper-to-lower \\nratio in the child.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nShort Stature\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nShort Stature\\nGH is a 191–amino acid protein secreted by the pituitary gland \\nunder the control of GRF and SRIF (see Fig. 170.2). GH secretion \\nis enhanced by α-adrenergic stimulation, hypoglycemia, starva-\\ntion, exercise, early stages of sleep, and stress and inhibited by \\nβ-adrenergic stimulation and hyperglycemia. Because concentra-\\ntions of GH are low throughout the day, except for brief secretory \\npeaks in the middle of the night or early morning, the daytime \\nascertainment of GH deficiency or sufficiency on the basis of \\na single determination of a random GH concentration is impos-\\nsible. Adequacy of GH secretion may be determined by a \\nstimulation test to measure peak GH secretion. A normal \\nresponse is a vigorous secretory peak after stimulation; the lack \\nof such a peak is consistent with GH deficiency. However, there \\nis a high false-positive rate (on any day, about 10% or more of \\nnormal children may not reach the normal GH peak after even \\ntwo stimulatory tests). Indirect measurements of GH secretion, \\nsuch as serum concentrations of IGF-1 and IGF-BP3, are \\nconsidered better screens for GH deficiency.\\nThe factors responsible for postnatal growth are not the same \\nas the factors that mediate fetal growth. Thyroid hormone \\nis essential for normal postnatal growth, although a thyroid \\nhormone-deficient fetus achieves a normal birth length; similarly, \\na GH-deficient fetus has a normal birth length, although in IGF-1 \\ndeficiency resulting from GH resistance (Laron dwarfism), \\nfetuses are shorter than control subjects. Adequate thyroid \\nhormone is necessary to allow the secretion of GH. Hypothyroid \\npatients may appear falsely to be GH deficient; with thyroid \\nhormone repletion, GH secretion normalizes. Gonadal steroids \\nare important in the pubertal growth spurt. The effects of other \\nhormones on growth are noted in Table 173.1.\\nABNORMALITIES OF GROWTH\\nShort Stature of Nonendocrine Causes\\nShort stature is defined as subnormal height relative to other \\nchildren of the same gender and age, taking family heights into \\nconsideration.

Growth failure denotes a slow growth \\nrate regardless of stature. Ultimately a slow growth rate leads \\nto short stature, but a disease process is detected sooner if the \\ndecreased growth rate is noted before the stature becomes short. \\nPlotted on a growth chart, growth failure appears as a curve \\nthat crosses percentiles downward and is associated with a \\nheight velocity below the 5th percentile of height velocity for \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Pseudohypoparathyroidism leads to short \\nstature and developmental delay with short fourth and fifth digits \\n(Albright hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype), resistance to \\nparathyroid hormone and resultant hypocalcemia, and elevated \\nlevels of serum phosphorus. Turner syndrome is characterized \\nby a karyotype of 45,XO or by a mosaic karyotype and clinically \\npresents with short stature, shield chest, wide-spaced nipples, \\nwide-carrying angle of the upper extremities, high-arched palate, \\ngonadal failure, kidney dysplasias with normal function, and \\naortic arch abnormalities. Affected girls are often susceptible \\nto autoimmune disorders.\\nNutrition is the most important factor affecting growth on a \\nworldwide basis (see Chapter 28). Failure to thrive may develop \\nin the infant as a result of maternal deprivation (nutritional \\ndeficiency or aberrant psychosocial interaction) or as a result \\nof organic illness (anorexia, nutrient losses through a form of \\nmalabsorption, or hypermetabolism caused by hyperthyroidism \\nor other causes; see Chapter 21). Psychological difficulties also \\ncan affect growth, as in psychosocial or deprivation dwarf-\\nism, in which the child develops functional temporary GH \\ndeficiency and poor growth as a result of psychological abuse; \\nwhen placed in a different, healthier psychosocial environment, \\nGH physiology normalizes, and growth occurs.\\nThe common condition known as constitutional delay in \\ngrowth or puberty or both is considered a variation of normal \\ngrowth, caused by a reduced tempo, or cadence, of physiological \\ndevelopment (see Fig. 173.1). Usually a family member had \\ndelayed growth or puberty but achieved a normal final height. \\nThe bone age is delayed, but the growth rate remains mostly \\nwithin the lower limits of normal. Constitutional delay usually \\nleads to a delay in secondary sexual development. Genetic or \\nfamilial short stature (Table 173.3) refers to the stature of a \\nchild of short parents, who is expected to reach a lower than \\naverage height and yet normal for these parents. If the parents \\nwere malnourished as children, grew up in a zone of war, or \\nsuffered famine, the heights of the parents are less predictive.\\nPhenotypic features suggesting an underlying chromosomal \\ndisorder can occur in many syndromes. These syndromes can be \\nsuspected by attending to arm spans and upper-to-lower segment \\nratios. Genetic syndromes often combine obesity and decreased \\nheight, whereas otherwise normal obese children are usually \\nHeight (cm)\\n5                   10                   15         18 \\n95\\n50\\n5\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nAge (yr)\\n170\\n150\\n130\\nFIGURE 173.1 Patterns of linear growth.

Idiopathic GH deficiency, of unidentified \\nspecific etiology, is the most common cause of both congenital \\nand acquired GH deficiency. Less often, GH deficiency is caused \\nby anatomical defects of the pituitary gland, such as pituitary \\naplasia or other midline defects, with variable degrees of \\ndeficiency of other pituitary functions. Hereditary forms of \\nGH deficiency that affect pituitary differentiation are the result \\nof heterogeneous defects of the gene for GH, GRF , or GH \\nreceptor. Classic GH deficiency refers to very reduced to absent \\nsecretion of GH; numerous short children may have intermediate \\nforms of decreased GH secretion. Acquired GH deficiency \\ncausing late-onset growth failure suggests the possibility of a \\ntumor of the hypothalamus or pituitary causing compression \\nof the area (see Tables 173.2 and 173.3).\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Dosage is titrated to the growth rate, weight of \\nthe patient, and IGF-1 levels. Treatment with GH carries the \\nlow risk of an increased incidence of slipped capital femoral \\nepiphysis, especially in rapidly growing adolescents, and of \\npseudotumor cerebri. Patients who have GH deficiency due to \\ntreatment for malignancy may be at higher risk for a secondary \\nmalignancy with GH therapy. Risks and benefits must be weighed \\nwith the family and treatment team.\\nAdministration of GH to patients with normal GH respon-\\nsiveness to secretagogues is controversial, but, as noted earlier, \\ndiagnostic tests are imperfect; if the patient is growing extremely \\nslowly without alternative explanation, GH therapy is sometimes \\nused. GH is effective in increasing the growth rate and final \\nheight in Turner syndrome and in chronic renal failure; GH \\nalso is used for treatment of short stature and muscle weakness \\nof Prader-Willi syndrome. Other indications include children \\nborn small for gestational age who have not exhibited catch-\\nup growth by 2 years of age and the long-term treatment of \\nidiopathic short stature with height 2.25 SDs or less below \\nthe mean. Psychological support of children with severe short \\nstature is important. Although there is controversy, marital \\nClinical Manifestations\\nInfants with congenital GH deficiency achieve a normal or \\nnear-normal birth length and weight at term, but the growth \\nrate slows after birth, most noticeably after age 2-3 years. These \\nchildren become progressively shorter for age and tend to have \\nan elevated weight-to-height ratio. Careful measurements in \\nthe first year of life may suggest the diagnosis, but most patients \\nelude diagnosis until several years of age. A patient with classic \\nGH deficiency has the appearance of a cherub (a chubby, \\nimmature appearance), with a high-pitched voice resulting \\nfrom an immature larynx. Unless severe hypoglycemia occurs \\nor dysraphism (midline defects) of the head includes a central \\nnervous system (CNS) defect that affects mentation, the patient \\nhas normal intellectual growth and age-appropriate speech. \\nMale neonates with isolated GH deficiency with or without \\ngonadotropin deficiency may have a microphallus (a stretched \\npenile length of <2 cm [normal is 3-5  cm]) and fasting \\nhypoglycemia. Patients who lack the adrenocorticotropic \\nhormone (ACTH, stimulates cortisol) in addition to GH may \\nhave more profound hypoglycemia because cortisol also \\nstimulates gluconeogenesis.\\nA very rare cause of growth failure is GH resistance or GH \\ninsensitivity, caused by abnormal number or function of GH \\nreceptors or by a postreceptor defect. Patients with the autosomal \\nrecessive Laron syndrome, involving mutations of the GH recep-\\ntor, have a prominent forehead, hypoplastic nasal bridge, delayed \\ndentition, sparse hair, blue sclerae, delayed bone maturation and \\nosteoporosis, progressive adiposity, hypercholesterolemia, and \\nlow blood glucose. They have elevated serum GH concentrations, \\nalthough serum IGF-1 and IGF-BP3 concentrations are low. \\nMalnutrition, medications (corticosteroids), or severe liver \\ndisease may cause acquired GH resistance  because serum \\nGH is elevated and IGF-1 is decreased.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf family or other medical history does not provide a likely \\ndiagnosis, screening tests should include a metabolic panel to \\nevaluate kidney and liver function, a complete blood count \\n(CBC) to rule out anemia, a celiac panel to rule out celiac \\ndisease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid function \\ntesting, and IGF-1, IGFBP-3 for children under age 3 years. A \\nurine study should be performed to assess renal function and \\nevaluate for renal tubular acidosis. In a girl, a karyotype to rule \\nout Turner syndrome should be considered. A bone age will \\nestablish skeletal maturation.\\nIf chronic disease or familial short stature are ruled out and \\nroutine laboratory testing is normal (Table 173.4), two GH \\nstimulatory tests are commonly performed (see Table 170.2). \\nGH testing should be offered to a patient who is short (<5th \\npercentile and usually >3.5 SDs below the mean), growing \\npoorly (<5th percentile growth rate for age), or whose height \\nprojection, based on bone age, is considerably below the target \\nheight when corrected for family height.\\nClassic GH-deficient patients do not show an increase in \\nserum GH levels after stimulation. Some patients release GH \\nin response to secretagogue testing but cannot release GH \\nspontaneously during the day or night. Tests for GH secretion \\nare insensitive, not very specific, and fairly variable. In equivocal \\ncases, an operational definition of GH deficiency might be that \\npatients grow significantly faster when administered a normal \\ndose of GH than before treatment.\\nTABLE 173.4 Growth Failure: Screening Tests\\nTEST RATIONALE\\nCBC Anemia: nutritional, chronic disease, \\nmalignancy\\nLeukopenia: bone marrow failure \\nsyndromes\\nThrombocytopenia: malignancy, infection\\nESR, CRP Inflammation of infection, inflammatory \\ndiseases, malignancy\\nMetabolic panel \\n(electrolytes, liver \\nenzymes, BUN)\\nSigns of acute or chronic hepatic, renal, \\nadrenal dysfunction; hydration and \\nacid-base status\\nCarotene, folate, and \\nprothrombin time; \\nceliac antibody panel\\nAssess malabsorption; detect celiac \\ndisease\\nUrinalysis with pH Signs of renal dysfunction, hydration, \\nwater and salt homeostasis; renal tubular \\nacidosis\\nKaryotype Determines Turner (XO) or other \\nsyndromes\\nCranial imaging (MRI) Assesses hypothalamic-pituitary tumors \\n(craniopharyngioma, glioma, germinoma) \\nor congenital midline defects\\nBone age Compare with height age and evaluate \\nheight potential\\nIGF-1, IGF-BP3 Reflects growth hormone status or \\nnutrition\\nFree thyroxine Detects MPHD or isolated \\nhypothyroidism\\nProlactin Elevated in hypothalamic dysfunction or \\ndestruction, suppressed in pituitary \\ndisease\\nBUN, Blood urea nitrogen; CBC, complete blood count; CRP, C-reactive protein; \\nESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-BP3, \\ninsulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; \\nMPHD, multiple pituitary hormone deficiency.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

In boys the \\nfirst typical event is scrotal thinning followed by the enlargement \\nof testes and by the appearance of pubic hair (long diameter of \\nthe testis >2.5 cm, volume >4 mL). M ost of the enlargement \\nof testes during puberty is the result of seminiferous tubule \\nmaturation.\\nDELAYED PUBERTY\\nstatus, satisfaction with life, and vocational achievement may \\nbe decreased in children of short stature who are not given \\nsupportive measures.\\nCHAPTER 174 \\nDisorders of Puberty\\nPHYSIOLOGY\\nThe staging of pubertal changes and the sequence of events \\nare discussed in Chapter 67. The onset of puberty is marked \\nby pubarche and gonadarche. Pubarche results from adrenal \\nmaturation or adrenarche and is marked with the appearance \\nof pubic hair; other features include oiliness of hair and skin, \\nacne, axillary hair, and body odor. Gonadarche is characterized \\nby increasing secretion of gonadal sex steroids as a result of the \\nmaturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. These \\nsex steroids differ by gender, consisting of testosterone from \\nthe testes and estradiol and progesterone from the ovaries. \\nIn males physical signs are pubic hair, axillary hair, facial \\nhair, increased muscularity, deeper voice, increased penile \\nsize, and increased testicular volume. In females the physical \\nsigns are breast development, development of the female body \\nhabitus, increased size of the uterus, and menarche with regular \\nmenstrual cycles. The third component is the growth spurt  \\nof puberty.\\nHypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), \\nproduced by cells in the arcuate nucleus, is secreted from the \\nmedian eminence of the hypothalamus into the pituitary portal \\nsystem and reaches the membrane receptors on the pituitary \\ngonadotropes to cause the production and release of luteinizing \\nhormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) into \\nthe circulation. Mutations in genes encoding neurokinin B \\nand neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. \\nNeurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of \\nkisspeptin, a compound responsible for the release of GnRH \\nand, indirectly, release of LH and FSH. The hypothalamic-\\npituitary-gonadal axis is active in the fetus and newborn but \\nis suppressed in the childhood years until activity increases \\nagain at the onset of puberty.\\nIn females FSH stimulates the ovarian production of estrogen \\nand, later in puberty, causes the formation and support of corpus \\nluteum. In males LH stimulates the production of testosterone \\nfrom the Leydig cells; later in puberty, FSH stimulates the \\ndevelopment and support of the seminiferous tubules. The \\ngonads also produce the protein inhibin. Both sex steroids and \\ninhibin suppress the secretion of gonadotropins. The interplay \\nof the products of the gonads and GnRH modulates the serum \\nconcentrations of gonadotropins. GnRH is released in episodic \\npulses that vary during development and during the menstrual \\nperiod. These pulses ensure that gonadotropins are released in \\na pulsatile manner. With the onset of puberty, the amplitude \\nof the pulses of gonadotropins and, in turn, the sex steroids \\nincreases, first at night and then throughout the day. Adrenarche \\ngenerally occurs several years earlier than gonadarche and is \\nheralded by increasing circulating dehydroepiandrosterone \\n(DHEA) or androstenedione. Serum DHEA increases years \\nbefore the appearance of its effects.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nPubertal Delay\\nPuberty is delayed when there is no sign of pubertal development \\nby age 13 years in girls and 14 years in boys living in the United \\nStates (Tables 174.1 and 174.2).\\nConstitutional Delay in Growth  \\nand Adolescence\\nPatients with constitutional delay have delayed onset of pubertal \\ndevelopment and significant bone age delay (2 standard devia-\\ntions below the mean, which is equal to a 1.5- to 2-year delay \\nas a teenager). Usually height gain is below, although fairly \\nparallel to, the normal percentiles on the growth curve. The \\nprepubertal nadir, or deceleration before their pubertal growth \\nspurt, is prolonged or protracted. A family history of delayed \\npuberty in a parent or sibling is reassuring. Spontaneous puberty \\nusually begins in these patients by the time the bone age reaches \\n12 years in boys and 11 years in girls. Other causes of delayed \\npuberty must be eliminated before a diagnosis of constitutional \\ndelay in puberty is made. Observation and reassurance are \\nappropriate. Adult height normal for the genetic potential is \\ngenerally attained. In some cases, boys may be treated with \\nlow-dose testosterone for a few months if the bone age is at \\nleast 11-12 years. Treatment is not required for longer than \\n4-8 months because endogenous hormone production usually \\nensues. Boys who do not initiate endogenous hormone produc-\\ntion should be evaluated for other causes of hypogonadism. \\nEstrogen treatment has been used in girls with constitutional \\ndelay, but there are no clear studies showing the added benefits. \\nY oung women with delayed puberty may need to be evaluated \\nfor primary amenorrhea.\\nHypogonadotropic Hypogonadism\\nAs a cause of delayed or absent puberty, hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadism may be difficult to distinguish from constitutional \\ndelay (see Tables 174.1 and 174.2). Hypogonadotropic hypo-\\ngonadism precludes spontaneous entry into gonadarche; \\nadrenarche usually occurs to some degree. Throughout child-\\nhood and in early puberty, patients with hypogonadotropic \\nhypogonadism have normal proportions and growth. When \\nthese patients reach adulthood, eunuchoid proportions may \\nensue because their long bones grow for longer than normal, \\nproducing an upper-to-lower ratio below the lower limit of \\nnormal of 0.9 and an arm span greater than their height.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

If there is an inability to release gonadotropins \\nbut no other pituitary abnormality, the patient has isolated \\ngonadotropin deficiency (almost universally a result of absent \\nGnRH).

There is genetic heterogeneity; \\nsome patients have a decreased sense of smell, others have \\nabnormal reproduction, and some have both.

The diagnosis must be \\nconsidered in any girl who is short without a contributory \\nhistory. Patients with other types of gonadal dysgenesis, or \\ngalactosemia, as well as patients who have undergone radiation \\ntherapy or chemotherapy for malignancy may develop ovarian \\nfailure.\\nKlinefelter syndrome (seminiferous tubular dysgenesis) is \\nthe most common cause of testicular failure. The karyotype is \\n47,XXY , but variants with more X chromosomes are possible. \\nThe incidence is approximately 1 in 500-1 in 1,000 in males. \\nTestosterone levels may be close to normal, at least until mid-\\npuberty, because Leydig cell function may be spared; however, \\nseminiferous tubular function characteristically is lost, causing \\ninfertility. Commonly LH levels may be normal to elevated, \\nwhereas FSH levels are usually more unequivocally elevated. \\nThe age of onset of puberty is usually normal, but secondary \\nsexual changes may not progress because of inadequate Leydig \\ncell function.\\nPrimary Amenorrhea\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAmenorrhea\\nPubertal Delay\\nIn addition to other diagnoses mentioned, other conditions need \\nto be considered when evaluating girls with lack of menses. \\nThe Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome of \\ncongenital absence of the uterus occurs in 1 in 4,000-5,000 \\nfemale births. Anatomical obstruction by imperforate hymen \\nor vaginal septum also presents with normal secondary sexual \\ndevelopment without menstruation. The complete syndrome of \\nandrogen insensitivity includes normal feminization, absence \\nof pubic or axillary hair, and primary amenorrhea. In this \\nsyndrome, all müllerian structures, including ovaries, uterus, \\nfallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina, are lacking; \\nthe karyotype is 46,XY , and patients have intraabdominal  \\ntestes.\\nEvaluation\\nWhen no secondary sexual development is present after the \\nupper age limits of normal pubertal development, serum \\ngonadotropin levels should be obtained to determine whether \\nthe patient has a hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic \\nhypogonadism (see Table 174.2). Based on gonadotropin \\nmeasurements only, the differentiation between constitutional \\ndelay in growth and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is difficult; \\nthe gonadotropin levels are low in both conditions.

In boys it is also important to note whether \\nthe testes are enlarged more than 2.5  cm in len gth (4  mL \\nvolume), which implies gonadarche. If the testes are not enlarged \\nbut virilization is progressing, the source of the androgens may \\nbe the adrenal glands or exogenous sources.\\nLaboratory evaluation includes determination of adrenal \\nandrogen and sex steroid levels (testosterone, estradiol, DHEAS \\n[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]) and baseline gonadotropin \\nconcentrations. The inherent nature of gonadotropin secretion is \\ncharacterized by low secretory rates throughout childhood and \\npulsatile secretion in adolescents and adults. If baseline gonado-\\ntropin values are elevated into the normal pubertal range, central \\nprecocious puberty is likely. If baseline gonadotropins are low, \\nhowever, no immediate conclusion may be drawn as to GnRH-\\ndependent versus GnRH-independent precocious puberty. This \\ndistinction often requires the assessment of gonadotropin \\nresponsiveness to GnRH stimulation. A prepubertal GnRH \\nresponse is FSH predominant, whereas a pubertal response is \\nmore LH predominant. Thyroid hormone determination also \\nis useful because severe primary hypothyroidism can cause \\nincomplete precocious puberty. If there is a suggestion of a \\nCNS anomaly or a tumor (CNS, hepatic, adrenal, ovarian, or \\ntesticular), MRI of the brain and pituitary with and without \\ncontrast is indicated. MRI of the is recommended in patients \\nwith the diagnosis of central precocious puberty; however, the \\nyield is generally low in girls over age 6. Boys as well as young \\ngirls have a higher risk of CNS lesions as a cause of precocious \\npuberty.\\nTreatment\\nLong-acting, superactive analogs of GnRH (leuprolide depot, \\nhistrelin depot) are the treatment of choice for central precocious \\npuberty. They suppress gonadotropin secretion by downregu-\\nlating GnRH receptors in the pituitary gonadotropes (Table \\n174.5), causing gonadal secretion to revert to the prepubertal \\nstate. Boys with GnRH-independent premature Leydig cell and \\noccur. Adrenal carcinomas usually secrete adrenal androgens, \\nsuch as DHEA; adrenal adenomas may virilize a child as a \\nresult of the production of androgen or may feminize a child \\nas a result of the production of estrogen.\\nBoys may have precocious gonadarche on the basis of a rare \\nentity called familial male-limited precocious puberty. This \\ncondition, with germ cell maturation caused by an X-limited \\ndominant defect, produces constitutive activation of the LH \\nreceptor that leads to continuous production and secretion \\nof testosterone without requiring LH or human chorionic \\ngonadotropin (hCG).\\nhCG-secreting tumors stimulate LH receptors and increase \\ntestosterone secretion. These tumors may be found in various \\nplaces, including the pineal gland (dysgerminomas) or the liver \\n(hepatoblastoma).\\nGerminomas are noncalcifying hypothalamic or pineal \\ntumors that frequently produce hCG, which may cause sexual \\nprecocity in prepubertal boys (hCG cross reacts with the LH \\nreceptor because of the similarity of structure between LH \\nand hCG). Optic or hypothalamic gliomas (with or without \\nneurofibromatosis), astrocytomas, and ependymomas may cause \\nprecocious puberty by disrupting the negative restraint of the \\nareas of the CNS that normally inhibit pubertal development \\nthroughout childhood. These tumors may require radiotherapy, \\nwhich contributes to a significant risk for hypopituitarism.\\nOvarian cysts may occur once or may be recurrent.

There are no other signs of puberty and no \\nevidence of excessive estrogen effect (vaginal bleeding, thicken-\\ning of the vaginal secretions, increased height velocity, or bone \\nage acceleration). Ingestion or dermal application of estrogen-\\ncontaining compounds must be excluded. Laboratory investiga-\\ntions are not usually necessary, but a pelvic ultrasound study \\nrarely may be indicated to exclude ovarian disease. Girls with \\nthis condition should be re-evaluated at intervals of 6-12 months \\nto ensure that apparent premature thelarche is not the beginning \\nof progression into precocious puberty. The prognosis is excel-\\nlent; if no progression occurs, no treatment other than reas -\\nsurance is necessary.\\nGynecomastia\\nIn males breast tissue is termed gynecomastia, and it may occur \\nto some degree in 45-75% of normal pubertal boys (see Chapter \\n67). Androgens normally are converted to estrogen by aromatiza-\\ntion; in early puberty, only modest amounts of androgens are \\nproduced, and the estrogen effect can overwhelm the androgen \\neffects at this stage. Later in pubertal development, the androgen \\nproduction is so great that there is little effect from the estrogen \\nproduced by aromatization. Gynecomastia also can suggest the \\npossibility of Klinefelter syndrome as puberty progresses. \\nPrepubertal gynecomastia suggests an unusual source of estrogen \\neither from exogenous sources (oral or dermal estrogen \\nadministration is possible from contamination of food or \\nointments) or from endogenous sources (from abnormal func-\\ntion of adrenal gland or ovary or from increased peripheral \\naromatization).\\nThe isolated appearance of pubic hair before age 6-7 years in \\ngirls or before age 9 years in boys is termed premature pubarche, \\nusually resulting from adrenarche. It is relatively common. If \\nthe pubic hair is associated with any other feature of virilization \\n(clitoral or penile enlargement or advanced bone age) or other \\nsigns (acne, rapid growth, or voice change), a detailed investiga-\\ntion for a pathological cause of virilization is indicated. Measure-\\nments of serum testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and \\nDHEAS are indicated to investigate the possibility of CAH. \\nUltrasound studies may reveal a hyperplastic adrenal gland or \\na virilizing adrenal or ovarian tumor. Most patients with isolated \\npubic hair do not have progressive virilization and simply have \\npremature adrenarche (pubarche) resulting from premature \\nactivation of DHEA secretion from the adrenal gland. The \\nskeletal maturation, as assessed by bone age, may be slightly \\nadvanced and the height slightly increased, but testosterone \\nconcentrations are normal. DHEA levels usually are high for \\nprepubertal age but are consistent with Tanner (sexuality \\nmaturity rating) stages II and III. In girls, there have been \\nstudies linking premature adrenarche to the development of \\nirregular menses or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) later \\nin adolescence.\\nCHAPTER 175 \\nThyroid Disease\\nTHYROID PHYSIOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT\\nThyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a tripeptide synthesized \\nin the hypothalamus, stimulates the release of pituitary thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone (TSH). Pituitary TSH is a glycoprotein \\nthat stimulates the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones \\nby the thyroid gland. Thyroid function develops in three stages. \\nAt the end of the first trimester, the gland descends from the \\nfloor of the primitive oral cavity to its definitive position in \\nthe anterior lower neck. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid \\naxis becomes functional in the second trimester. Peripheral \\nmetabolism of thyroid hormones matures in the third trimester.\\nThyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and TSH do not cross \\nthe placenta in significant amounts. Concentrations in fetal \\nserum reflect primarily fetal secretion and metabolism. Maternal \\nthyroid antibodies, iodides (including radioactive iodides), \\nand medications given to mothers to treat hyperthyroidism \\n(methimazole and propylthiouracil) cross the placenta and affect \\nfetal thyroid function.

Although not a hypothyroid condition, congenital \\nthyroxine-binding globulin deficiency occurs in about 1 in \\n10,000 live births and is associated with low serum total T 4 \\nconcentration, normal TSH, and normal serum free T4. This is a \\neuthyroid condition and does not require treatment with thyroid \\nhormone because it is merely a binding protein abnormality. \\nIt is commonly X-linked dominant.\\nClinical manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism in \\nthe immediate newborn period usually are subtle but become \\nmore evident weeks or months after birth. By then it is too late \\nto ensure that there is not a detriment to the infant’s cognitive \\ndevelopment. Newborn screening is crucial to make an early \\ndiagnosis and initiate thyroid replacement therapy by younger \\nthan 1 month of age. Findings at various stages after birth include \\nhypothermia, acrocyanosis, respiratory distress, large fontanels, \\nabdominal distention, lethargy and poor feeding, prolonged \\njaundice, edema, umbilical hernia, mottled skin, constipation, \\nlarge tongue, dry skin, and hoarse cry. Thyroid hormones are \\ncrucial for maturation and differentiation of tissues, such as \\nbone and brain (most thyroid-dependent brain maturation \\noccurs in the first 2-3 years after birth; Table 175.3).\\nWhen treatment (with levothyroxine) is initiated within 1 \\nmonth or less after birth, the prognosis for normal intellectual \\ndevelopment is excellent. State screening programs usually allow \\nfor therapy within 1-2 weeks of birth. If therapy is instituted after \\n6 months when the signs of severe hypothyroidism are present, \\nthe likelihood of normal intellectual function is markedly \\ndecreased. Growth improves after thyroid replacement even in \\nlate diagnosed cases. The dose of levothyroxine changes with age; \\n10-15 µg/kg of levothyroxine is used for a newborn, but about \\n3 µg/kg is used later in childhood. In neonatal hypothyroidism, \\nthe goal is to bring the serum free T 4 rapidly into the upper \\nhalf of the range of normal. Suppression of TSH is not seen \\nand not necessary in all cases because such suppression may \\nlead to excessive doses of levothyroxine.\\nAcquired Hypothyroidism\\nThe etiology of acquired hypothyroidism is presented in Table \\n175.2. The clinical manifestations may be subtle. Hypothyroidism \\nshould be suspected in any child who has a decline in growth \\nvelocity, especially if not associated with weight loss (see Table \\n175.3). The most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism \\nin older children in the United States is lymphocytic autoimmune \\nthyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis). In many areas of the world, \\niodine deficiency is the etiology of endemic goiter (endemic \\ncretinism). The failure of the thyroid gland may be heralded \\nby an increase of TSH before T4 levels decrease. In contrast to \\nuntreated congenital hypothyroidism, acquired hypothyroidism \\nis not a cause of permanent developmental delay.\\nHashimoto Thyroiditis\\nAlso known as autoimmune or lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashi-\\nmoto thyroiditis is a common cause of goiter and acquired \\nthyroid disease in older children and adolescents. A family \\nhistory of thyroid disease is present in 25-35% of patients. The \\netiology is an autoimmune process targeted against the thyroid \\ngland with lymphocytic infiltration and lymphoid follicle and \\ngerminal center formation preceding fibrosis and atrophy.\\nClinical manifestations include a firm, nontender euthyroid, \\nhypothyroid, or, rarely, hyperthyroid (hashitoxicosis) diffuse \\ngoiter with a pebble-like surface. See Table 175.3 for signs and \\nsymptoms, which can be diverse.

Autoimmune \\npolyglandular syndrome type II consists of Addison disease, \\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus, and frequently hypothyroidism.

The resulting excessive synthesis, release, and peripheral \\nmetabolism of thyroid hormones produce the clinical features. \\nHashimoto thyroiditis and thyrotoxicosis are on a continuum \\nof autoimmune diseases; there is overlap in their immunological \\nfindings.\\nAntithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies may \\nbe present in thyrotoxicosis, although the values are usually \\nlower than in Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Irritability, tachycardia \\n(often with signs of cardiac failure simulating cardiomyopathy), \\npolycythemia, craniosynostosis, bone age advancement, poor \\nfeeding, and failure to thrive are the clinical hallmarks. This \\ncondition may be anticipated if the mother is known to be \\nthyrotoxic or has an elevated TSI during third trimester of \\npregnancy. Cure of hyperthyroidism before pregnancy (surgery \\nor radioiodine treatment) limits or curtails T4 production but \\nnot the underlying immune disturbance producing TSIs; thus \\nthe infant still may be affected, at least transiently.\\nTreatment for a severely affected neonate includes methima-\\nzole and, as needed, a β blocker to help decrease symptoms. \\nBecause the half-life of the immunoglobulin is several weeks, \\nspontaneous resolution of neonatal thyrotoxicosis resulting from \\ntransplacental passage of TSIs usually occurs by 2-3 months \\nof age. Observation without treatment is indicated in patients \\nwho are minimally affected.\\nNODULES/TUMORS OF THE THYROID\\nAbout 2% of children develop solitary thyroid nodules, most \\nof which are benign. Evaluation of a nodule includes thyroid \\nfunction tests, neck ultrasound, and, if needed, fine-needle \\naspiration (FNA). Ultrasound guidance may be needed for \\naspiration of small nodules or those not palpable. Nodules \\nfound to be benign on FNA may be monitored through clinical \\nexam and ultrasound.\\nCarcinoma of the thyroid is rare in children (1% of all \\npediatric cancers in the 5- to 9-year-old age group and up to \\n7% of cancers in the 15- to 19-year-old age group). Papillary \\nand follicular carcinomas represent 90% of childhood thyroid \\ncancers. A history of therapeutic head or neck irradiation \\nor radiation exposure from nuclear accidents predisposes a \\nchild to thyroid cancer. Carcinoma usually presents as a firm \\nto hard, painless, nonfunctional solitary nodule and may \\nspread to adjacent lymph nodes. Rapid growth, hoarseness \\n(recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), and lung metastasis \\nmay be present. If the nodule is solid on ultrasound, is cold \\non radioiodine scanning, and feels hard, the likelihood of a \\ncarcinoma is high. Excisional biopsy usually is performed, but \\nFNA biopsy also may be diagnostic.\\nTreatment includes total thyroidectomy, selective regional \\nnode dissection, and radioablation with 131I for residual or \\nrecurrent disease. The prognosis is usually good if the disease \\nis diagnosed early.\\nMedullary carcinoma of the thyroid may be asymptomatic \\nexcept for a mass. Diagnosis is based on the presence of elevated \\ncalcitonin levels, either in the basal state or after pentagastrin \\nstimulation (difficult to obtain) and histological examination. \\nThis tumor most often occurs with multiple endocrine neo-\\nplasia 2a or 2b (MEN), possibly in a familial pattern. In some \\nfamilies, the presence of mutations of the RET protooncogene \\nis predictive of the development of medullary carcinoma of \\nthe thyroid. The location of the mutation can help determine \\nwhen removal of the thyroid is warranted. Genetic screening \\nof other members of the family is indicated after a proband \\nis recognized. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is indicated for the \\nfamily members with the same allele.\\nor propylthiouracil (5-7  m g/kg/day divided every 8 hours).  \\nBoth medications are equally effective; however, propylthio -\\nuracil is no longer a first-line therapy secondary to concerns \\nof severe liver injury and acute liver failure. A β blocker,  \\nsuch as propranolol or atenolol, is started if symptoms are  \\nsevere to control cardiac manifestations and is tapered as  \\nthe methimazole takes effect. Antithyroid medication is \\nusually continued for 1-2 years because the remission rate \\nis approximately 25% per year. In patients complying with \\nthe treatment regimen, the 2-year course of treatment can \\nbe repeated. Medication should suppress thyroid function to \\nnormal without the need to add thyroid hormone replacement \\nto normalize serum free T4. Complications of methimazole \\nare muscle pain, rash, granulocytopenia, and jaundice. The \\ngranulocytopenia is an idiosyncratic complication of rapid \\nonset, which is observed only in the early months after \\ninstitution of antithyroid medication and requires monitoring \\nthe complete blood count. If a suppressed white blood cell \\ncount is observed, antithyroid therapy must be discontinued. \\nThis potentially lethal rare complication affects 3 in 10,000 \\nusers a year. After resolution, the other of the two antithyroid \\nmedications can be started because there is usually less than \\na 50% chance of a similar reaction from the other medication. \\nIodine administration, which may suppress thyroid func-\\ntion but becomes ineffective in a few weeks, is sometimes \\nused as a preparation for surgery, but never for long-term  \\ntherapy.\\nRadioiodine\\nRadioiodine (131I) is slower in exerting therapeutic effects, may \\nrequire repeated dosing, and is likely to cause permanent \\nhypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is the desired outcome because \\nit is easier and safer to treat than continued hyperthyroidism. \\nAlthough studies reveal no long-term consequences, concern \\nremains about possible sequelae in children. This method of \\ntreatment is entering the mainstream for children and adoles-\\ncents. Radioiodine given to a pregnant teenager renders the \\nfetus hypothyroid and is contraindicated.\\nSurgery\\nSurgical treatment consists of partial or complete thyroidectomy. \\nRisks associated with thyroidectomy include the use of anesthesia \\nand the possibility that the thyroid removal will be excessive, \\ncausing hypothyroidism, or that it will be inadequate, resulting \\nin persistent hyperthyroidism. In addition, keloid formation, \\nrecurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, and hypoparathyroidism \\n(transient postoperative or permanent) may occur. Thyroid \\nstorm caused by the release of large amounts of preformed \\nhormone is a serious but rare complication. Even with optimal \\nimmediate postoperative results, patients may become hypo-\\nthyroid within 10 years.\\nThyroid Storm\\nThyroid storm (see Table 175.4) is a rare medical emergency \\nconsisting of tachycardia, disorientation, elevated blood \\npressure, and hyperthermia. Treatment includes reducing \\nthe hyperthermia with a cooling blanket and administering \\na β blocker to control the tachycardia, hypertension, and \\nautonomic hyperfunction symptoms. Iodine may be given to \\nblock thyroid hormone release after an antithyroid medication \\nis started. Hydrocortisone may be indicated for relative adrenal \\ninsufficiency and therapy for heart failure includes diuretics and  \\ndigoxin.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

PTH is secreted in response to a decrease in serum \\nionized calcium level. PTH attaches to its membrane receptor \\nthen acts via adenylate cyclase to mobilize calcium from bone \\ninto the serum and to enhance fractional reabsorption of calcium \\nby the kidney while inducing phosphate excretion; all increase \\nthe serum calcium concentration and decrease serum phosphate. \\nLack of PTH effect is heralded by low serum calcium in the \\npresence of elevated phosphate for age. PTH stimulates vitamin \\nD secretion by increasing renal 1α-hydroxylase activity and \\nacts indirectly to elevate serum calcium concentration by \\nstimulating the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D from \\n25-hydroxyvitamin D. Calcitonin increases the deposition of \\ncalcium into bone; in normal states the effect is subtle, but \\ncalcitonin may be used temporarily to suppress extremely \\nelevated serum calcium values.\\n1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D enhances calcium absorption from \\nthe gastrointestinal tract, increasing serum calcium levels and \\nbone mineralization.

Genes \\nusually determine the morphology of internal organs and of \\ngonads (gonadal sex); this directs the appearance of the external \\ngenitalia that form the secondary sex characteristics (phenotypic \\nsex); self-perception of the individual (gender identity) and \\nthe perception of the individual by others (gender role) follow. \\nIn most children, these features blend and conform, but, in \\nsome patients, one or more features may not follow this \\nsequence, leading to the disorder of sexual development (DSD; \\nsee Chapter 23).\\nThe internal and external genitalia are formed between 6 \\nand 13 weeks of gestation. Fetal gonad and external genitalia \\nare bipotential and have the capacity to support development \\nof a normal male or female phenotype (Fig. 177.1). In the \\npresence of a gene called SRY for sex-determining region on \\nthe Y chromosome, the primitive fetal gonad differentiates \\ninto a testis (Fig. 177.2).

Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism involves \\nadministering vitamin D, preferably as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin \\nD and calcium.

Mixed gonadal \\ndysgenesis (45,X; 46,XY) often may present with genital ambigu-\\nity, asymmetric external genitalia, and inguinal hernias. There \\nmay be virilization on one side and none on the other. Similar \\nfindings may be seen with ovotesticular DSD, another classifica-\\ntion of DSD.\\nAmbiguous genitalia in a newborn must be attended to with \\nas little delay as possible and with informed sensitivity to the \\npsychosocial context as required. The laboratory evaluations \\nrequired might take days or weeks to complete, delaying a sex \\nassignment and naming of the infant, such that choice often \\nprecedes diagnosis. Beyond infancy and childhood, and to offset \\nany gender uncertainty in the patient and confusion in the \\nparents, health care providers must help families come to an \\nappropriate closure and gender choice. With that, most centers \\ncaring for patients with ambiguous genitalia include a behavioral \\nhealth specialist with a focus on patients and families encounter-\\ning these issues.\\nOn physical examination, it is essential to note where the \\nurethral opening lies and whether there is fusion of the anterior \\nportion of the labioscrotal folds. Endogenous excessive produc-\\ntion of androgen (as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH]) \\nin a female fetus between 9 and 13 weeks of gestation leads to \\nambiguous genitalia. If the vaginal opening is normal, and there \\nis no fusion, but the clitoris is enlarged without ventral fusion \\nof the ventral urethra, the patient likely had later exposure \\nto androgens. In a patient with a fully formed scrotum, even \\nif small, and a normally formed but small penis, termed a \\nmicrophallus, the patient likely had normal exposure to and \\naction of androgen during 9-13 weeks of gestation.\\nThe major goal is a rapid identification of any life-threatening \\ndisorders (salt loss and shock caused by the salt-losing form \\nof CAH). Although the classic approach to sex assignment \\nhas been based on the feasibility of genital reconstruction \\nand potential fertility rather than on karyotype or gonadal \\nhistology, the effects of prenatal androgen must be considered. \\nExperts recommend waiting until the child is able to be part \\nof the dialogue regarding gender identity and reconstruction \\nwhen appropriate. Present management of ambiguous genitalia \\ninvolves extensive open discussion with parents involving \\nthe biology of the infant and the likely prognosis. Treatment \\nshould be individualized and managed by a team, including an \\nexperienced pediatric endocrinologist, urologist or gynecologist, \\npsychologist, geneticist, and the primary care physician.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step toward diagnosis is to determine whether the \\nfindings represent virilization of a genetic female (androgen \\nexcess) or underdevelopment of a genetic male (androgen \\ndeficiency; see Fig. 177.2). Inguinal gonads that are evident on \\npalpation usually are testes and indicate that incomplete develop-\\nment of a male phenotype has occurred; this pattern is not \\nconsistent, and ovaries and ovotestes may feel similar.

The general scheme of these synthetic steps is \\nshown in Fig. 178.1.\\nHypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) \\nstimulates the release of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone \\n(ACTH or corticotropin), derived by selective processing from \\npro-opiomelanocortin. ACTH governs the synthesis and release \\nof cortisol and adrenal androgens. Primary adrenal insufficiency \\nor cortisol deficiency from any defect in the adrenal gland results \\nin an oversecretion of ACTH; adrenal insufficiency may also \\noccur from ACTH (secondary) or CRH (tertiary) deficiency, \\nresulting in low serum ACTH concentrations and low cortisol. \\nEndogenous (or exogenous) glucocorticoids feedback to inhibit \\nACTH and CRH secretion. The renin-angiotensin system and \\npotassium regulate aldosterone secretion; ACTH has little effect \\non aldosterone production except in excess, when it may increase \\naldosterone secretion.\\nSteroids that circulate in the free form (not bound to cortisol-\\nbinding protein [transcortin]) may cross the placenta from \\nmother to fetus, but ACTH does not. The placenta plays an \\nimportant role in steroid biosynthesis in utero by acting as a \\nmetabolic mediator between mother and child. As the fetal \\nCRH-ACTH-adrenal axis is operational in utero, any deficiencies \\nin cortisol synthesis lead to excessive ACTH secretion. If a viril-\\nizing adrenal enzyme defect is present, such as 21-hydroxylase \\ndeficiency, the fetal adrenal gland secretes excess androgens, \\nresulting in a virilized fetus. Normal variation of serum cortisol \\nand ACTH levels leads to values that are high early in the \\nmorning and lower at night. This normal diurnal variation may \\ntake months to years to fully develop in neonates.\\nADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY\\nof many factors needed to assist the family in the decision of \\nsex of rearing; the SRY gene may be found on chromosomes \\nother than the Y chromosome, and, conversely, a Y chromosome \\nmay lack an SRY gene (it may have been translocated to an X \\nchromosome, leading to the development of a 46,XX male-XX \\nsex reversal, testicular DSD).\\nStatistically, most virilized females have CAH; 90% of \\nthese females have 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The diagnosis \\nis established by measuring the plasma concentration of \\n17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione (see Chapter 178), \\nwhich typically is hundreds of times above the normal range. \\nOther enzymatic defects also may be diagnosed by quantifying \\ncirculating levels of the adrenal steroid precursor proximal to \\nthe defective enzyme block.\\nEstablishing an accurate diagnosis is more difficult in under-\\ndeveloped males. When certain types of adrenal hyperplasia \\ncoexist with defects in androgen production of the testes, \\nexcessive ACTH secretion elevates substantially levels of specific \\nadrenal steroid precursors, allowing a diagnosis. If the defect \\nis restricted to testosterone biosynthesis, the measurement \\nof testosterone and its precursors in the basal state and after \\nstimulation by HCG may be required. Patients with normal levels \\nof testosterone either have persistent androgen resistance or have \\nhad an interruption of normal morphogenesis of the genitalia. \\nAbnormalities of the sex chromosomes may be associated with \\ndysgenetic gonads, which may be associated with persistence \\nof müllerian structures.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment consists of replacing deficient hormones (cortisol \\nin adrenal hyperplasia or testosterone in a child with androgen \\nbiosynthetic defects who will be raised as male), surgical restora-\\ntion to make the individual look more appropriate for the gender \\nof rearing, and psychological support of the whole family. \\nGonads and internal organs discordant for the gender of rearing \\nmay be removed. Dysgenetic gonads with Y-genetic material \\nalways should be removed because gonadoblastomas or \\ndysgerminomas may develop in the organ. Age at which \\nreconstructive surgery is recommended is controversial; some \\nadvocate that surgery not be performed in infancy or early \\nchildhood so that the child or young adolescent can be involved \\nin the decision. A decision for gender of rearing is recommended \\nfrom birth; however, the knowledge that the person with a \\nDSD may change gender later on is shared with parents from \\nthe outset.\\nCHAPTER 178 \\nAdrenal Gland Dysfunction\\nPHYSIOLOGY\\nThe adrenal gland consists of an outer cortex, which is respon-\\nsible for the synthesis of steroids, and an inner medulla derived \\nfrom neuroectodermal tissue, which synthesizes catecholamines. \\nThe adrenal cortex consists of three zones: an outer glomerulosa \\n(end product is the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, which \\nregulates sodium and potassium balance), a middle fasciculata \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAmbiguous Genitalia\\nHyponatremia\\nHyperkalemia\\nThe clinical manifestations of inadequate adrenal function \\nresult from inadequate secretion or action of glucocorticoids, \\nmineralocorticoids, or both (Table 178.1).

Because these forms \\ncannot be distinguished clinically, all presentations of ambiguous \\ngenitalia should involve evaluation for mineralocorticoid defi-\\nciency. In males, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (the most common \\nform of CAH) does not cause abnormal genitalia; although \\nthere may be hyperpigmentation of the scrotal skin, this is a \\nsubtle sign and can result in delayed diagnosis. In all infants, \\nthe diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be overlooked or \\nconfused with pyloric stenosis. In pyloric stenosis, vomiting \\nof stomach contents results in hypochloremia, low or normal \\nserum potassium, and alkalosis in contrast to CAH, which \\nhas hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis.

Overtreatment will cause growth stunting and weight \\ngain (cushingoid features), whereas undertreatment will cause \\nexcessive height gain, skeletal advance, and early appearance \\npuberty, ultimately jeopardizing adult height potential.\\nLate-onset CAH is typically noted years after birth. Affected \\nsubjects have milder manifestations without ambiguous genitalia, \\nbut they may have acne, hirsutism, and, in girls, irregular \\nmenstrual cycles or amenorrhea. Late-onset CAH in girls may \\nbe confused with polycystic ovarian syndrome.\\nBiochemical diagnostic studies  show elevated levels of \\nserum 17-OHP , the substrate for the defective 21-hydroxylase \\nenzyme activity. In newborns with CAH, the values are elevated \\na 100-fold to a 1,000-fold. In late-onset CAH, an ACTH stimula-\\ntion test may be necessary to show an abnormally high response \\nof 17-OHP . Serum cortisol and aldosterone levels (in salt losers) \\nare low and renin levels are high, whereas the testosterone level \\nis elevated because it is derived from 17-OHP .\\nThe goals of treatment are to achieve normal linear growth \\nand bone age advancement. Long-term therapy consists of \\nproviding glucocorticoids at a dose of approximately 10-15 m g/\\nm2/24 hr in three divided doses of oral hydrocortisone or its \\nequivalent. Mineralocorticoid therapy for salt losers consists \\nof fludrocortisone at a dose of 0.1-0.2  m g/24  hr , often with \\nsodium chloride supplementation in infancy and early child -\\nhood. Surgical correction of ambiguous external genitalia may \\nbe considered. The adequacy of glucocorticoid replacement \\ntherapy is monitored by determining serum concentrations of \\nadrenal precursors, including androstenedione and 17-OHP \\nfor 21-hydroxylase deficiency. In addition, the assessment of \\nlinear growth and skeletal age, by bone age determination, is \\nrequired as a reflection of appropriate therapy. To avoid adrenal \\ninsufficiency, threefold higher doses of glucocorticoids are given \\nduring stressful states, such as febrile illnesses and surgery. \\nIntramuscular hydrocortisone is used in severe emergencies or \\nwith illnesses involving emesis. Mineralocorticoid therapy is \\nmonitored with serum sodium, potassium, and plasma renin \\nactivity levels. Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone to sup-\\npress fetal ACTH-induced androgen production can reduce \\nor eliminate the ambiguity of the external genitalia in affected \\nfemale fetuses, if begun at approximately 7 weeks of gestation; \\nhowever, this remains controversial.\\nOTHER ENZYME DEFECTS\\nOther enzyme defects are rare in contrast to 21-hydroxylase \\ndeficiency. In 11-hydroxylase deficiency, the next most common \\ncause of CAH, virilization occurs with salt retention and \\nhypokalemia as a result of the buildup of deoxycorticosterone \\n(see Fig. 178.1), a potent mineralocorticoid. Hypertension \\ndevelops as a result of excessive mineralocorticoid production. \\nTable 178.2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical features \\nof adrenal insufficiency in infancy.\\nADDISON DISEASE\\nThe incidence of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is about 1 \\nin 15,000 among various white populations. Nonclassic CAH \\nmay occur with an incidence of 1 in 50 in certain populations. \\nThe gene for 21-hydroxylase lies on the short arm of chromo-\\nsome 6; the genotype may be determined in a proband, permit-\\nting prenatal diagnosis in a subsequent pregnancy.\\nDeficient 21-hydroxylase activity (P-450 c21 deficiency) \\nimpairs the conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) \\nto 11-deoxycortisol and in the salt-losing form, of progesterone \\nto deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid proximal in the \\npathway to the production of aldosterone. The decreased \\nproduction of cortisol causes hypersecretion of ACTH, which \\nstimulates the synthesis of steroids immediately proximal to the \\nblock and shunting of these to overproduction of androgens. \\nThe primary clinical manifestation is the virilization of the \\nexternal genitalia of the affected female fetus. The development \\nof the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are unaffected by \\nthe androgens. The degree of virilization varies, ranging from \\nmild clitoromegaly to complete fusion of labioscrotal folds, \\nwith severe clitoromegaly simulating a phallus (see Chapter \\n177). A male infant with this defect appears normal at birth, \\nalthough penile enlargement may be apparent thereafter. The \\ndeficiency in aldosterone, found in about 75% of patients, causes \\nsalt wasting with shock and dehydration until the diagnosis is \\nestablished and appropriate treatment is given.\\nThe treatment of 21-hydroxylase deficiency requires hydro-\\ncortisone and fludrocortisone in the case of the salt-losing form. \\nTABLE 178.1 Clinical Manifestations of Adrenal \\nInsufficiency\\nCortisol deficiency\\n Hypoglycemia\\n Inability to withstand stress\\n Vasomotor collapse\\n Hyperpigmentation (in primary adrenal insufficiency with excess \\nof adrenocorticotropic hormone)\\n Apneic spells\\n Muscle weakness, fatigue\\nAldosterone deficiency\\n Hyponatremia\\n Hyperkalemia\\n Vomiting\\n Urinary sodium wasting\\n Salt craving\\n Acidosis\\n Failure to thrive\\n Volume depletion\\n Hypotension\\n Dehydration\\n Shock\\n Diarrhea\\n Muscle weakness\\nAndrogen excess or deficiency (caused by adrenal enzyme defect)\\nAmbiguous genitalia in certain conditions\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHyponatremia\\nHyperkalemia\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Shellhaas\\nCHAPTER 179 \\nNeurology Assessment\\nA neurological evaluation, including history, physical examina-\\ntion, and judicious use of ancillary studies, allows the localization \\nand diagnosis of nervous system pathology. The process and \\ninterpretation of the neurological examination varies with age; \\nthe newborn is unique, with many transient and primitive \\nreflexes, whereas the examinations of adolescents and adults \\nare similar. Careful evaluations of social, cognitive, language, \\nfine motor, and gross motor skills, and their age appropriateness \\nare key.\\nHISTORY\\nGathering neurological history follows the traditional medical \\nmodel with three additions: the pace and localization of the \\nproblem and the developmental assessment. The symptom evolu-\\ntion provides clues to the underlying process. Symptoms may \\nevolve in a progressive, static, or episodic fashion. Progressive \\nsymptoms may present suddenly (seizures, stroke); acutely over \\nminutes or hours (epidural hemorrhage); subacutely over days \\nor weeks (brain tumor); or slowly over years (hereditary neu-\\nropathies). Static neurological abnormalities are observed early \\nin life and do not change in character over time (cerebral palsy). \\nStatic lesions are often caused by congenital brain abnormali-\\nties or prenatal/perinatal brain injury. Intermittent attacks of \\nrecurrent, stereotyped episodes suggest epilepsy or migraine \\nsyndromes, among others. Episodic disorders are characterized \\nby periods of symptoms, followed by partial or complete recovery \\n(demyelinating, autoimmune, vascular diseases).\\nCareful evaluations of social, cognitive, language, fine motor, \\nand gross motor skills are key (Chapter 7) to distinguish normal \\ndevelopment from isolated or global delays. Loss of skills over \\ntime (regression) is particularly worrisome and may suggest \\nan underlying degenerative disease, emerging autism spectrum \\ndisorder, epileptic encephalopathy, or other neurological \\ndiagnoses.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nObservation of the child’s appearance, movement, and behavior \\nbegins at the start of the encounter. For example, the child may \\ndisplay an unusual posture, abnormal gait, or lack of awareness \\nof the environment.\\nThe brain and skin have the same embryonic origin \\n(ectoderm), so abnormalities of hair, skin, teeth, and nails are \\nassociated with congenital brain disorders (neurocutaneous \\ndisorders) such as neurofibromatosis (NF type 1), in which \\ncafé-au-lait macules (flat, light brown macules) are character-\\nistic. Adenoma sebaceum (fibrovascular lesions that look like \\nacne on the nose and malar regions), nail fibromas, ash-leaf \\nspots (hypopigmented macules), and Shagreen patches (flesh-\\ncolored soft plaques with prominent follicular openings) are \\ncommonly seen in older children and adults with tuberous  \\nsclerosis.\\nThe head circumference is measured in its largest occipi -\\ntofrontal circumference and plotted against standard growth \\ncurves (Chapter 5). Microcephaly and macrocephaly represent \\nan occipitofrontal circumference 2 standard deviations below \\nor above the mean, respectively. Measurements plotted over \\ntime may show an accelerating pattern (hydrocephalus) or \\ndecelerating pattern (brain injury, degenerative neurological \\ndisorder). The anterior fontanelle is slightly depressed and \\npulsatile when a calm infant is upright. A tense or bulging \\nfontanelle may indicate increased intracranial pressure \\n(ICP) but may also be seen in a crying or febrile infant. \\nPremature closure of one or more sutures (craniosynostosis) \\nresults in an unusual shape of the head. Abnormal shape, \\nlocation, or condition of the face, eyes, nares, philtrum, lips, \\nor ears (dysmorphic features) are found in many genetic  \\nsyndromes.\\nA careful ocular examination is essential and should \\ninclude a search for epicanthal folds, coloboma, conjunc-\\ntival telangiectasias, and cataracts. Direct ophthalmoscopy \\nassesses the optic discs and macula for abnormalities, such \\nas papilledema or a cherry red spot. A complete examination \\nof the retina involves dilating the pupil and use of indirect  \\nophthalmoscopy.\\nExamination of the hands and feet may reveal abnormal \\ncreases or digits (Chapters 50 and 201). The neck and spine \\nshould be examined for obvious (myelomeningocele) or subtle \\n(cutaneous dimples, sinus tracts, hair tufts, subcutaneous \\nlipomas) midline defects. Nervous system abnormalities may \\nresult in kyphosis or scoliosis (Chapter 202).\\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF  \\nA NEONATE\\nThe neonatal neurological examination primarily assesses the \\nfunction of the basal ganglia, brainstem, and more caudal \\nstructures.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The cranial nerve examination evaluates the integrity \\nof the brainstem. The motor examination evaluates upper and \\nlower motor neuron function. The sensory examination assesses \\nthe peripheral sensory receptors and their central reflections. \\nDeep tendon reflexes  assess upper and lower motor \\nconnections.\\nMental Status and Developmental Evaluation\\nAlertness is assessed in infants by observing spontaneous \\nactivities, feeding behavior, and visual ability to fix and follow \\nobjects. Responses to tactile, visual, and auditory stimuli are \\nnoted. If consciousness is altered, the response to painful stimuli \\nis noted. Observation of toddlers at play allows a nonthreatening \\nassessment of developmentally appropriate skills. In addition \\nto language function, older children can be tested for reading, \\nwriting, numerical skills, fund of knowledge, abstract reasoning, \\njudgment, humor, and memory.\\nThe simplest way to assess intellectual abilities is through \\nlanguage skills. Language function is receptive (understanding \\nspeech or gestures) and expressive (speech and use of gestures). \\nAbnormalities of language resulting from cerebral hemisphere \\ndisorders are referred to as aphasias. Anterior, expressive, or \\nBroca aphasia is characterized by sparse, nonfluent language. \\nPosterior, receptive, or Wernicke aphasia is characterized by \\nan inability to understand language, with speech that is fluent \\nbut nonsensical. Global aphasia refers to impaired expressive \\nand receptive language.\\nCRANIAL NERVE EVALUATION\\nThe cranial nerve evaluation assesses brainstem integrity, but \\ndepends on the stage of brain maturation and the ability to \\ncooperate. A colorful toy may capture a young child’s attention \\nand permit observation of coordination, movement, and cranial \\nnerve function.\\nMental Status\\nA healthy newborn infant should have periods of quiet, sustained \\nwakefulness interspersed with sleep. Irritability, lethargy, or \\nmore severely depressed consciousness are nonspecific signs \\nof abnormal brain function.\\nReflexes\\nExamination of the primitive reflexes provides assessment of \\nthe functional integrity of the brainstem and basal ganglia (Table \\n179.1). Many of these stereotyped motor responses are present \\nat birth. They are symmetrical and disappear at 4-6 months of \\nage, indicating the normal maturation of descending inhibitory \\ncerebral influences. Asymmetry or persistence of the primitive \\nreflexes may indicate focal brain or peripheral nerve lesions.\\nMotor Examination and Tone\\nPosture is the position that a calm infant naturally assumes \\nwhen placed supine. An infant at 28 weeks of gestation shows \\nan extended posture. By 32 weeks, there is a trend toward \\nincrease in tone and flexion of the lower extremities. At 34 \\nweeks, the lower extremities are flexed; the upper extremities \\nare extended. The term infant flexes lower and upper extremities. \\nRecoil, the readiness with which an arm or leg springs back \\nto its original position after passive stretching and release, is \\nessentially absent in very premature infants but is brisk at term. \\nBecause of the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, it is essential \\nto maintain the infant’s head in a neutral position (not turned \\nto the side) during assessment of posture and tone. Spontaneous \\nmovements of premature infants are slow and writhing; those \\nof term infants are more rapid.\\nNEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF A CHILD\\nThe purpose of the neurological examination is to localize or \\nidentify the region from which the symptoms arise.

Facial sensation can be functionally assessed in an \\ninfant by gently brushing the cheek, which will produce the \\nrooting reflex (turns head and neck with mouthing movement, \\nas if seeking to nurse).\\nCranial Nerve VII\\nFacial muscles are assessed by observing the face during rest, \\ncrying, and blinking. At older, cooperative ages, children \\ncan be asked to smile, blow out their cheeks, blink forc -\\nibly, and furrow their foreheads. Weakness of all unilateral \\nmuscles of the face, including the forehead, eye, and mouth, \\nindicates a lesion of the ipsilateral peripheral facial nerve \\n(Bell palsy).  Since the upper third of the face receives \\nbilateral cortical innervation, if the weakness affects only \\nthe lower face and mouth, a contralateral lesion of upper \\nmotor neurons in the brain (tumor, stroke, abscess) must be  \\nconsidered.\\nCranial Nerve VIII\\nLesions of cranial nerve VIII cause deafness, tinnitus, and \\nvertigo. Normally, alert neonates blink in response to a bell \\nor other abrupt, loud sound. Four-month-old infants turn their \\nhead and eyes to localize a sound. Hearing can be tested in \\na verbal child by whispering a word in one ear while cover -\\ning the opposite ear. If there are any concerns about hearing, \\nformal audiologic assessment is indicated. Delayed language \\ndevelopment should trigger a referral for a formal hearing  \\nassessment.\\nLesions of the vestibular component of cranial nerve VIII \\nproduce symptoms of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, \\nand nystagmus. Nystagmus is an involuntary beating eye move-\\nment with a rapid phase in one direction and a slow phase \\nin the opposite direction. By convention, the direction of the \\nnystagmus is defined by the fast phase and may be horizontal, \\nvertical, or rotatory.\\nCranial Nerves IX and X\\nThe gag reflex is brisk at all ages except the very immature \\nneonate. An absent gag reflex suggests a lesion of the brainstem, \\ncranial nerves IX or X, neuromuscular junction, or pharyn -\\ngeal muscles. Weak, breathy, or nasal speech, weak sucking, \\ndrooling, inability to handle secretions, gagging, and nasal \\nregurgitation of food are additional symptoms of cranial nerve X  \\ndysfunction.\\nCranial Nerve XI\\nObserving the infant’s posture and spontaneous activity assesses \\nthe functions of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. \\nHead tilt and drooping of the shoulder suggest lesions involving \\ncranial nerve XI. In later childhood, strength in these muscles \\ncan be tested directly.\\nCranial Nerve XII\\nAtrophy and fasciculation of the tongue usually indicate a lesion \\nof the anterior horn cells (spinal muscular atrophy). Assessment \\nis most reliable when an infant is asleep. The tongue deviates \\ntoward the weak side in unilateral lesions.\\nCranial Nerve I\\nSmell can be assessed in verbal, cooperative children older \\nthan 2 years of age. Aromatic substances (perfumes, vanilla) \\nshould be used instead of volatile substances (ammonia), \\nwhich irritate the nasal mucosa and stimulate the trigeminal  \\nnerve.\\nCranial Nerve II\\nFull-term newborns in a quiet awake state follow human \\nfaces, lights in a dark room, or large, opticokinetic strips. \\nVisual acuity has been estimated to be 20/200 in newborns \\nand gradually matures throughout childhood. Standard visual \\ncharts displaying pictures instead of letters can be used to \\nassess visual acuity in toddlers. Peripheral vision is tested \\nby surreptitiously bringing objects into the visual field from \\nbehind. A reduced pupillary reaction to light suggests anterior \\nvisual pathway (retina, optic nerves, chiasm) lesions. Unilateral \\nlesions are identified by the swinging flashlight test. With an \\noptic nerve abnormality, both pupils constrict when light is \\ndirected into the normal eye. When light is swung over to the \\nabnormal eye, both pupils dilate inappropriately; this is called \\nan afferent pupillary defect or Marcus Gunn pupil. Interruption \\nof the sympathetic innervation to the pupil produces Horner \\nsyndrome (ptosis, miosis, and unilateral facial anhidrosis). In \\nthis instance, anisocoria (unequal pupils) is more pronounced \\nin a dark room because the affected pupil is unable to dilate \\nappropriately. Lesions of the posterior visual pathway, including \\nthe lateral geniculate, optic radiations, and occipital cortex, have \\nnormal pupillary light reactions but are expressed by loss of  \\nvisual fields.\\nCranial Nerves III, IV, and VI\\nThese three cranial nerves control eye movements and \\nare most easily examined with the use of a colorful toy to \\ncapture the child’s attention. For infants too young to fix \\nand follow, rotating the infant’s head assesses oculocephalic \\nvestibular reflexes (doll’s eye maneuver). If the brainstem is \\nintact, rotating a newborn or comatose patient’s head to the \\nright causes the eyes to move to the left, and vice versa. In \\nawake, older patients, voluntary eye movements mask the  \\nreflex.\\nAbnormalities of these cranial nerves may cause diplopia \\n(double vision). With unilateral third cranial nerve (oculo -\\nmotor nerve) palsy, the involved eye deviates down and out \\n(infraducted, abducted), with associated ptosis and a dilated \\n(mydriatic) pupil. Injury to cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) \\ncauses weakness of downward eye movement with consequent \\nvertical diplopia. Cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) palsy results \\nin the inability to move the eye outward. Cranial nerve VI has \\na long intracranial route within the subarachnoid space; failure \\nof abduction of one or both eyes is a frequent, but nonspecific, \\nsign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).\\nCranial Nerve V\\nThe muscles of mastication can be observed as an infant sucks \\nand swallows. The corneal reflex  can test cranial nerves V \\nophthalmic division and VII at any age.

The toddler gait is normally wide-\\nbased and unsteady. The base of the gait narrows with age. By \\n6 years, a typical child is able to walk on their toes or heels \\nand can tandem walk (heel to toe). Cerebellar dysfunction \\nresults in a broad-based, unsteady gait accompanied by difficulty \\nin executing turns. Corticospinal tract dysfunction produces \\na stiff, scissoring gait and toe walking; arm swing is decreased, \\nand the affected arm is flexed across the body. Extrapyramidal \\ndysfunction produces a slow, stiff, shuffling gait with dystonic \\npostures. A waddling gait occurs with hip weakness due to \\nlower motor neuron or neuromuscular disorders. A steppage \\ngait results from weakness of ankle dorsiflexors (common \\nperoneal palsy).\\nReflexes\\nDeep tendon reflexes can be elicited at any age and are reported \\non a five-point scale:\\n0 Absent\\n1 Trace\\n2 Normal\\n3 E xaggerated reflex, with spread to contiguous areas (tapping \\na patellar reflex and observing a bilaterally brisk quadriceps \\nresponse)\\n4 C lonus (self-limited or sustained)\\nThese reflexes are decreased in lower motor neuron dis-\\neases and increased in upper motor neuron disease. Babinski \\nresponse, or extensor plantar reflex, is an upward movement of \\nthe great toe and flaring of the toes on stimulation of the lateral \\nfoot and is a sign of corticospinal tract dysfunction. This reflex \\nis unreliable in neonates, except when asymmetrical, because \\nthe “normal” response at this age varies. By 12-18 months of \\nage, the plantar response should consistently be flexor (toes \\nflexing down).\\nSENSORY EXAMINATION\\nThe sensory examination of newborns and infants is limited \\nto observing the behavioral response to light touch or gentle \\nsterile pinprick. Stimulation of a limb should produce a facial \\ngrimace. A spinal reflex alone may produce withdrawal move-\\nment of a limb. In a cooperative child, the senses of pain, touch, \\ntemperature, vibration, and joint position can be tested individu-\\nally. The cortical areas of sensation must be intact to identify \\nan object placed in the hand (stereognosis) or a number written \\nin the hand (graphesthesia) or to distinguish between two \\nsharp objects applied simultaneously and closely on the skin \\n(two-point discrimination).\\nSPECIAL DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES\\nCerebrospinal Fluid Analysis\\nAnalysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential when central \\nnervous system infection is suspected and provides important \\nclues to other diagnoses (Table 179.2). Differentiating hemor-\\nrhagic CSF caused by a traumatic lumbar puncture (LP) from a \\ntrue subarachnoid hemorrhage may be difficult. In most cases \\nof traumatic LP , the fluid clears significantly as the sequence of \\ntubes is collected. If there is clinical evidence of increased ICP \\n(papilledema, depression of consciousness, focal neurological \\ndeficits), caution must be exercised before performing an LP \\nto limit risk of cerebral herniation. A computed tomography \\n(CT) scan should be performed and confirmed to be normal \\nMOTOR EXAMINATION\\nStrength\\nIn infants, strength is assessed by observation of spontaneous \\nmovements and movements against gravity. Extremity move-\\nments should be symmetrical and are best seen when the infant \\nis held supine with one hand supporting the buttocks and one \\nsupporting the shoulders. Strength is graded as follows:\\n5 Normal\\n4 W eak but able to provide resistance\\n3 A ble to move against gravity but not against resistance\\n2 U nable to move against gravity\\n1 M inimal movement\\n0 C omplete paralysis\\nStrength in toddlers is assessed by observing functional \\nabilities, such as walking, stooping to pick up an object, and \\nstanding up from the floor. An older child should be able to \\neasily reach high above his or her head, wheelbarrow walk, \\nrun, hop, go up and down stairs, and arise from the ground. \\nCooperative children can undergo individual muscle strength \\ntesting. Gower sign (child arises from lying on the floor by using \\nhis arms to climb up his legs and body) is a sign of significant \\nproximal weakness. Subtle upper extremity asymmetry can \\nbe detected when the child extends arms out in front with the \\npalms upward and eyes closed. The hand on the weaker side \\ncups and begins to pronate slowly (pronator drift). Muscle \\nfasciculations indicate denervation from disease of the anterior \\nhorn cell or peripheral nerve.\\nTone\\nTone represents the dynamic resistance of muscles to passive \\nstretch. Lower motor and cerebellar lesions produce decreased \\ntone (hypotonia). Upper motor lesions produce increased tone \\n(spasticity). In extrapyramidal disease, an increase in resistance \\nis present throughout passive movement of a joint (rigidity).\\nBulk\\nMuscle bulk may be decreased due to disuse or to lower motor \\nneuron or neuromuscular disease. Excessive muscle bulk is \\nseen in rare conditions, such as myotonia congenita; boys with \\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy have pseudohypertrophy of their \\ncalves.\\nCoordination\\nAtaxia is the lack of coordination of movement, which is typi-\\ncally due to a dysfunction of the cerebellar pathways. Observa-\\ntion and functional analysis help assess coordination in infants \\nand toddlers. Watching the child sit or walk assesses truncal \\nstability. Exchanging toys or objects with the child permits \\nassessment of intention tremor and dysmetria (errors in judging \\ndistance), signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Cooperative children \\ncan do repetitive finger or foot tapping to test rapid alternating \\nmovements. Cerebellar and corticospinal tract dysfunction \\nproduce slow and irregular alternating movements.\\nGait\\nWatching a child creep, crawl, cruise, or walk is the best global \\nassessment for the motor and coordination systems (Chapter \\n197).

There are three key features present: \\nbackground patterns, behavioral state modulation, and presence \\nor absence of epileptiform patterns. The background varies \\nwith age but in general should be symmetrical and synchronous \\nbetween the two hemispheres without any localized area of \\nhigher amplitude or slower frequencies (focal slowing). Persistent \\nfocal slowing suggests an underlying structural abnormality \\n(brain tumor, abscess, stroke). Bilateral disturbances of brain \\nactivity (increased ICP , metabolic encephalopathy) must be \\nsuspected when there is diffuse slow wave activity. Spikes, \\npolyspikes, and spike-and-wave abnormalities, either in a \\nlocalized region (focal) or distributed bihemispherically (general-\\nized), suggest an increased risk for seizures.\\nElectromyography and Nerve  \\nConduction Studies\\nElectromyography and nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) \\nassess for abnormalities of the neuromuscular apparatus, \\nincluding anterior horn cells, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular \\njunctions, and muscles. Normal muscle is electrically silent at \\nrest. Spontaneous discharges of motor fibers (fibrillations) or \\ngroups of muscle fibers (fasciculation) indicate denervation, \\nrevealing dysfunction of anterior horn cells or peripheral nerves. \\nAbnormal muscle responses to repetitive nerve stimulation are \\nseen with neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia \\ngravis and botulism. The amplitude and duration of the muscle \\ncompound action potentials are decreased in primary diseases \\nof muscle. NCVs assess the action potential transmission along \\nperipheral nerves. NCVs are slowed in demyelinating neuropa-\\nthies (Guillain-Barré syndrome). The amplitude of the signal \\nis diminished in axonal neuropathies.\\nNeuroimaging\\nImaging the brain and spinal cord is accomplished using CT \\nor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT is quick and acces-\\nsible for emergency purposes. MRI provides finer detail and, \\nwith different sequences, permits detection of posterior fossa \\nlesions, subtle cerebral abnormalities, vascular anomalies, \\nlow-grade tumors, and ischemic changes. For a child with an \\nacute head injury or sudden headache, cranial CT is the study \\nof choice because it can rapidly reveal intracranial hemorrhage \\nor other large lesions. For a child with new-onset focal seizures, \\nMRI is the study of choice because an area of focal cortical \\ndysplasia or other subtle lesions might not be apparent on CT. \\nMRI also provides excellent views of the spinal cord. Cranial \\nultrasonography is a noninvasive bedside procedure used to \\nvisualize the brain and ventricles of infants with open \\nfontanelles.\\nCHAPTER 180 \\nHeadache and Migraine\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nHeadache is a common symptom among children and adoles-\\ncents.

Epilepsy is defined as \\nrecurrent, unprovoked seizures. Epileptic seizures are generally \\nclassified as focal, arising from one region of the cortex, or \\ngeneralized, which arise from both hemispheres simultaneously \\n(Table 181.3). Approximately 4-10% of children experience \\nat least one seizure. The incidence of childhood epilepsy is  \\n1-2%.\\nFOCAL SEIZURES\\nFocal seizures with retained awareness  (previously termed \\nsimple partial seizures) arise from a specific anatomical focus \\nand may or may not spread to surrounding brain regions. \\nClinical symptoms include motor (tonic, clonic, myoclonic), \\nsensory, psychic, or autonomic abnormalities, but consciousness \\nis preserved. The location and extent of spread of the seizure \\nfocus determine the clinical symptoms.\\nFocal seizures with altered awareness (previously termed \\ncomplex partial seizures) can have similar sensorimotor signs, \\nbut also have associated alteration of consciousness. Although \\nthe child may not be completely unresponsive, subtle slowing \\nor alteration of mental status (dyscognitive features) may \\noccur. Along with altered responsiveness, patients may have \\nautomatisms or stare during these seizures. Automatisms are \\nfor intracranial bleeding. If the CT is negative, a lumbar puncture \\nshould be performed to measure opening pressure and evaluate \\nfor pleocytosis, elevated red blood cells, and xanthochromia.\\nTREATMENT\\nTreating migraines requires an individually tailored regimen \\nto address the frequency, severity, and disability produced by \\nthe headaches. Intermittent symptomatic, or abortive, analgesics \\nare the mainstay for treatment of infrequent episodes of \\nmigraine. Symptomatic therapy requires early analgesic admin-\\nistration, often accompanied by rest in a quiet, dark room. \\nAcetaminophen or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug such \\nas ibuprofen or naproxen sodium is often effective. Hydration \\nand antiemetics are useful adjunctive therapies. If these first-line \\nmedications are insufficient, triptan agents may be considered. \\nTriptans, available in injectable, nasal spray, oral disintegrating, \\nand tablet form, are serotonin receptor agonists that can alleviate \\nmigraine symptoms promptly. Triptans are contraindicated for \\npatients with focal neurological deficits associated with their \\nmigraines or signs consistent with basilar migraine (syncope) \\nbecause of the risk of stroke.\\nMany children suffer with severe and frequent migraines \\nthat disrupt their daily lives. Children with more than one \\ndisabling headache per week may require daily preventive \\nagents to reduce both attack frequency and severity. Preventive \\nmedications include tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, \\nnortriptyline), anticonvulsants (topiramate, valproic acid), \\nantihistamines (cyproheptadine), beta-blockers (propranolol), \\nand calcium channel blockers (verapamil).\\nBefore initiating daily medications, lifestyle modifications \\nmust be put into place to regulate sleep, daily routines, and \\nexercise and to identify and eliminate any precipitating or \\naggravating influences (caffeine, certain foods, stress, missed \\nmeals, dehydration). Other adjunctive treatment options include \\npsychological support, stress management, and biofeedback.\\nCHAPTER 181 \\nSeizures\\nA seizure is a transient occurrence of signs or symptoms resulting \\nfrom abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in \\nthe brain.\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nSeizures and Other Paroxysmal Disorders\\nTABLE 181.1 Paroxysmal Disorders of Childhood\\nSeizures/epilepsy\\nMigraine and variants\\n•\\t Paroxysmal\\ttorticollis \\tof \\tinfancy\\n•\\t Benign\\tparoxysmal \\tvertigo\\nSyncope\\n•\\t Vasovagal\\tsyncope\\n•\\t Breath-holding\\tspells\\n•\\t Cardiac\\tsyncope \\t(arrhythmias, \\tlong \\tQT \\tsyndrome)\\n•\\t Apnea\\nTransient ischemic attack\\nMetabolic disorders\\n•\\t Hypoglycemia\\n•\\t Inborn\\terrors \\tof \\tmetabolism\\nSleep disorders\\n•\\t Narcolepsy,\\tcataplexy\\n•\\t Night\\tterrors\\nParoxysmal dyskinesias and other movement disorders\\n•\\t Tics\\nShudder attacks\\nSandifer syndrome (gastroesophageal reflux causing paroxysmal \\nstiffening and posturing)\\nConversion disorder\\nMalingering\\nNormal behavior\\n•\\t Neonatal\\tjitteriness\\n•\\t Benign\\tsleep \\tmyoclonus\\nSelf-stimulatory behavior\\nThe differential diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders includes \\nseizures and nonepileptic events (Table 181.1).

Myoclonic epilepsy \\nusually is associated with multiple seizure types. The underlying \\ndisorder producing myoclonic epilepsy may be static (juvenile \\nmyoclonic epilepsy [JME]) or progressive and associated with \\nneurological deterioration (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis). \\nMyoclonic absence refers to body jerks that commonly \\naccompany typical or atypical absence seizures. Although atonic \\nseizures are typically brief (lasting 1-2 seconds), they are very \\ndisabling because of a sudden loss of postural tone that often \\nresults in falls and injuries.\\nFebrile Seizures\\nSeizures in the setting of fever may be caused by central nervous \\nsystem infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess), \\nunrecognized epilepsy triggered by fever, or febrile seizures. \\nThe latter represents the most common cause of seizures among \\nchildren between 6 months and 6 years of age, occurring in \\nabout 4% of all children. By definition, a febrile seizure occurs \\nin the presence of fever. Simple febrile seizures are generalized \\nat onset, last less than 15 minutes, and occur only once in a \\n24-hour period in a neurologically and developmentally normal \\nchild. If the seizure has focal features, lasts longer than 15 \\nminutes, recurs within 24 hours, or the child has preexisting \\nneurological challenges, the seizure is referred to as a complex \\nfebrile seizure.\\nThe prognosis of children with simple febrile seizures is \\nexcellent. Although febrile seizures recur in 30-50% of children, \\nintellectual achievements are normal. The risk of subsequent \\nepilepsy is not substantially greater than that of the general \\npopulation (approximately 2%). Factors that increase the risk \\nfor the development of epilepsy include abnormal neurological \\nexamination or development, family history of epilepsy, and \\ncomplex febrile seizures.\\nSince simple febrile seizures are brief and the outcome is \\nbenign, most children require no treatment. Rectal diazepam \\ncan be administered during a seizure to abort a prolonged \\nconvulsion; it is appropriate to provide a rescue medication \\nfor children with a history of prolonged febrile seizures. Since \\nantiseizure medications have side effects and children with \\nfebrile seizures have an excellent prognosis, daily antiseizure \\nmedication to prevent febrile seizures is not recommended. \\nAdministration of antipyretics during febrile illnesses does not \\nprevent febrile seizures; the seizure can often be the first sign \\nof a child’s illness.\\nPsychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures\\nPsychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) (previously termed \\npseudoseizures) may be the manifestation of conversion dis -\\norders or malingering. Additionally, children with epilepsy may, \\nconsciously or subconsciously, exhibit concurrent PNES. PNES \\nsemiology typically differs from epileptic seizures. In PNES, \\nthe patient’s eyes are often closed (typically eyes are open during \\nepileptic seizures) and the movements are tremulousness or \\nthrashing rather than tonic or clonic. Verbalization and pelvic \\nthrusting are seen more commonly in PNES, urinary and fecal \\ncontinence is usually preserved, and injury does not usually \\noccur. If the tongue is bitten, more often the tip of the tongue \\nis injured (as opposed to the sides of the tongue in epileptic \\nseizures). PNES can often be initiated or terminated by sug-\\ngestion. An EEG performed during PNES does not show \\nhallmark of absence seizures is a brief ( <15 seconds) loss of \\nawareness accompanied by eyelid fluttering or simple automa-\\ntisms, such as fumbling with the fingers and lip smacking. \\nAbsence seizures usually begin between 4 and 6 years of age. \\nNeurological examination and brain imaging are normal. The \\ncharacteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns consist \\nof generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave activity. An absence \\nseizure can often be provoked by hyperventilation. Differentiat-\\ning absence from focal seizures with altered awareness can be \\ndifficult but is essential for appropriate evaluation and treatment \\n(Table 181.4).\\nAtypical Absence, Myoclonic, and  \\nAtonic Seizures\\nAtypical absence seizures manifest as episodes of impaired \\nconsciousness with automatisms, autonomic phenomena, and \\nmotor manifestations, such as eye opening, eye deviation, and \\nbody stiffening. They are associated with slower EEG discharges \\n(2 H z) and accompany other seizure types. Myoclonus is a \\nsudden jerk of all or part of the body; not all myoclonus is due \\nto epilepsy. Nonepileptic myoclonus may be benign, as in sleep \\nTABLE 181.4 Differentiating Absence Seizures From \\nFocal Seizures With Altered Awareness\\nFEATURE ABSENCE SEIZURE\\nFOCAL SEIZURE \\nWITH ALTERED \\nAWARENESS\\nDuration Seconds Minutes\\nProvoking \\nmaneuver\\nHyperventilation\\nPhotic stimulation\\nVariable, but often \\nnone\\nPostictal phase None (return \\nimmediately to \\nbaseline)\\nConfusion, \\nsleepiness\\nNumber of \\nseizures\\nMany per day Infrequent (rarely \\nmore than one per \\nday)\\nEEG features Interictal: normal \\nexcept bursts of \\ngeneralized spike \\nwave and sometimes \\noccipital intermittent \\nrhythmic delta activity\\nIctal: 3-Hz generalized \\nspike-wave\\nInterictal: focal \\nslowing, sharp \\nwaves, or spikes\\nIctal: focal \\ndischarges (with or \\nwithout spread to \\ncontiguous regions \\nor the contralateral \\nhemisphere)\\nNeurological \\nexamination\\nNormal Normal, or focal \\ndeficits\\nNeuroimaging Normal* Normal, or focal \\nabnormalities (mesial \\ntemporal sclerosis, \\nfocal cortical \\ndysplasia, neoplasm, \\nencephalomalacia)\\nFirst-line \\ntreatment\\nEthosuximide or \\nvalproic acid†\\nOxcarbazepine\\n*In the proper clinical context, and with an appropriate EEG, a diagnosis of \\nabsence epilepsy should be made without neuroimaging.\\n†Oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine are relatively contraindicated for children \\nwith typical absence epilepsy, as their seizures can be exacerbated by these \\nmedications.\\nEEG, Electroencephalographic.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The peak age \\nat onset of infantile spasms is 3-8 months. The underlying \\netiology of the spasms dictates the prognosis. More than 200 \\ndifferent etiologies have been identified, including tuberous \\nsclerosis, malformations of cortical development (lissencephaly), \\ngenetic syndromes (trisomy 21), acquired brain injury (stroke, \\nperinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy), and metabolic \\ndisorders (phenylketonuria). Infants for whom an etiology is \\ndetermined are classified as having symptomatic infantile spasms \\nand are at very high risk for long-term neurodevelopmental \\ndifficulties. The etiology is not determined for a small subset \\nof children; these patients have a somewhat better long-term \\nprognosis but remain at high risk for adverse outcomes. With \\nadvances in genetic testing, fewer children have infantile spasms \\nof uncertain etiology.\\nInfantile spasms are a neurological emergency since rapid \\ninitiation of effective therapy offers the best chance for favorable \\nneurodevelopmental outcomes. First-line treatment options for \\ninfantile spasms include adrenocorticotropic hormone, high-\\ndose oral corticosteroids, and vigabatrin. Other antiseizure \\nmedications are much less effective. For infants with underly-\\ning tuberous sclerosis, vigabatrin is the treatment of choice. \\nFor other patients, treatment determinations are made on a \\ncase-by-case basis.\\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe epilepsy syndrome \\nwith variable age of onset. Most children present before age 5 \\nyears. Frequent, multiple seizure types including atonic, focal, \\natypical absence, and generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic \\nsemiologies characterize the disorder. Many children have \\nunderlying brain injury, malformations, or genetic etiologies. \\nThe seizures are typically difficult to control, and most patients \\nhave significant intellectual disability.\\nBenign neonatal convulsions are an autosomal dominant \\ngenetic disorder linked to abnormal neuronal potassium chan-\\nnels. Otherwise well newborns present with focal seizures toward \\nthe end of the first week of life, leading to the colloquial term \\nfifth-day fits. Response to treatment is generally excellent, and \\nthe long-term outcome is typically favorable.\\nAcquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) is \\ncharacterized by the abrupt loss of previously acquired language \\nin young children. The language disability is an acquired cortical \\nauditory deficit (auditory agnosia). The EEG is highly epilepti-\\nform in sleep, the peak area of abnormality often being in the \\ndominant perisylvian region (language areas). This diagnosis \\nshould be considered for young patients with clear autistic \\nregression, as it is a potentially treatable entity.\\nSTATUS EPILEPTICUS\\nStatus epilepticus is a neurological emergency and is defined \\nas (1) ongoing seizure activity or (2) repetitive seizures without \\nrecovery of consciousness for greater than 30 minutes. Status \\nepilepticus carries an approximately 14% risk of new neurological \\ndeficits and 4-5% mortality, both related to the underlying \\netiology. Etiologies include new-onset epilepsy, drug intoxication, \\ndrug withdrawal (especially missed anticonvulsant doses among \\nchildren with epilepsy), hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, \\nacute head trauma, infection, ischemic stroke, intracranial \\nhemorrhage, metabolic disorders, and hypoxia.\\nThe first priority of treatment is to ensure an adequate airway, \\nbreathing, and circulation (Chapter 38). Vital signs should be \\nepileptiform patterns. The diagnosis is critical because appropri-\\nate mental health care, and not anticonvulsant medications, is \\nthe crux of treatment. Careful assessment and intervention for \\nphysical or sexual abuse, as well as other social stressors, is a \\nkey component of the care of children with PNES.\\nEPILEPSY SYNDROMES\\nEpilepsy syndromes have distinctive EEG and clinical features \\n(age of seizure onset, specific seizure types). Recognition of \\nepilepsy syndromes provides useful information regarding the \\nunderlying etiologies that must be considered, treatments that \\nmay be helpful (or harmful), and long-term prognostic \\ninformation.\\nBenign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes,  \\nalso known as benign Rolandic epilepsy, is among the most \\ncommon epilepsy syndromes and usually begins between ages \\n5 and 10 years. The seizures typically occur only during sleep \\nor on awakening. Affected children usually have focal motor \\nseizures involving the face and arm (abnormal movement or \\nsensation around the face and mouth, drooling, rhythmic \\nguttural sound, impaired speech and swallowing). Seizures \\nsometimes evolve to bilateral convulsions. The interictal EEG \\ndemonstrates independent bilateral centrotemporal sharp waves \\nbut is otherwise normal. With a classic history and EEG and a \\nnormal neurological examination, the diagnosis can be made \\nwith confidence and neuroimaging is not required. Seizures \\nusually respond promptly to antiseizure medication. Intellectual \\noutcome is normal, and the epilepsy resolves after puberty. \\nComorbid learning difficulties (especially language-based \\nlearning disabilities) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \\n(ADHD) are common.\\nChildhood absence epilepsy is another common syndrome. \\nAbsence seizures typically begin in the early school years and \\nusually resolve by late childhood or adolescence. If absence does \\nnot remit, 44% will go on to develop JME (see later discussion). \\nEthosuximide is the first-choice medication. A subset of patients \\nalso has generalized tonic-clonic seizures. For these children, \\nvalproic acid is the first choice as it can prevent both absence \\nand convulsive seizures. Comorbid learning disabilities and \\nADHD are common. There is no contraindication to treating \\nthese children’s ADHD with stimulant medication.\\nJME is the most common generalized epilepsy among ado-\\nlescents and young adults. Onset is typically in early adolescence \\nwith myoclonic jerks (exacerbated in the morning, often causing \\nthe patient to drop objects), generalized tonic-clonic seizures, \\nand absence seizures. Seizures usually resolve promptly with \\nantiseizure medication. JME is classically treated with valproic \\nacid; however, there are concerns about side effects and terato-\\ngenicity. Levetiracetam has a much lower risk of teratogenicity \\nand is generally well tolerated.

Children with simple febrile \\nseizures who have recovered completely require little or no \\nlaboratory evaluation other than studies necessary to evaluate \\nthe source of the fever. If the clinical presentation does not \\nmeet these criteria and acute symptomatic seizures are suspected, \\nevaluation for potentially life-threatening causes such as \\nmeningitis, sepsis, head trauma, and toxins must be pursued. \\nA complete laboratory evaluation for new onset of seizures \\nincludes a complete blood count and measurement of glucose, \\ncalcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea \\nnitrogen, creatinine, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as \\nblood or urine toxicology screening. Children with clinical \\nsigns and symptoms of meningitis (neck stiffness, Kernig sign, \\nBrudzinski sign), or history or physical examination suggestive \\nof intracranial infection, should undergo a lumbar puncture. \\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be analyzed for cell counts, \\nculture, protein, and glucose levels. In children less than 18 \\nmonths old, particularly young infants, the clinical symptoms \\nof meningitis may be subtle. Neonates also may require testing \\nfor inborn errors of metabolism; blood ammonia; CSF glycine \\nand lactate; and a clinical trial of pyridoxine. Evaluation for \\ninfections, such as urine and stool cultures, and polymerase \\nchain reactions for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and \\nenterovirus should be considered.\\nThe EEG is the most useful neurodiagnostic test for distin-\\nguishing seizures from nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders and \\nfor classifying seizures as having focal or generalized onset. The \\nEEG must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history; \\nsome normal children have focal or epileptiform EEG patterns. \\nConversely, children with seizures may have normal interictal \\nEEGs. When the diagnosis is unclear, EEG with prolonged \\nrecordings and simultaneous video monitoring in an attempt \\nto capture a typical event may be necessary.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to computed \\ntomography (CT) in showing most brain pathology, but in the \\nemergency department setting, CT can be performed rapidly and \\noften shows acute intracranial hemorrhage more clearly than \\nMRI. MRI is unnecessary in patients with the primary general-\\nized epilepsies, such as typical childhood absence and JME. \\nLesions (tumors, arteriovenous malformations, cysts, strokes, \\ngliosis, focal atrophy) may be identified in 25% of patients with \\nother epilepsy types, even when the clinical examination and \\nEEG do not suggest focal features. Identification of some lesions, \\nsuch as focal cortical dysplasia, hamartoma, and mesial temporal \\nsclerosis, can assist in consideration of surgical treatment of \\npharmacoresistant epilepsy.\\nLONG-TERM THERAPY\\nThe decision to institute daily seizure medications for a first \\nunprovoked seizure is based on the likelihood of recurrence bal-\\nanced against the risk of long-term drug therapy. Determination \\nobtained and oxygen administered if needed. If respirations \\nare inadequate, positive-pressure ventilation may be required. \\nIntravenous (IV) access should be obtained, and laboratory \\nevaluation should be undertaken (see below).\\nSeveral pharmacological options exist for management of \\nstatus epilepticus (Table 181.5). Initial management is with a \\nbenzodiazepine and should begin if the seizure persists longer \\nthan 5 minutes. Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam are all \\neffective agents and should be given as an adequate single dose \\n(rather than successive smaller doses), which can be repeated \\none time. IV administration is preferred. However, when IV \\naccess is not available, benzodiazepines may be administered \\nvia rectal, intranasal, buccal, or intramuscular routes.\\nIf the seizure does not resolve after two doses of benzodiaz-\\nepine, a second-line agent must be administered. There are few \\ndata from clinical trials to guide subsequent management. For \\nnewborns and infants, phenobarbital is reasonable. For older \\nchildren, IV fosphenytoin (preferred over phenytoin due to \\ntolerability), valproic acid, or levetiracetam may be considered. \\nIf the seizures persist, options include repeating one of the \\nsecond-line medications or beginning a continuous infusion of \\nmidazolam or pentobarbital (with appropriate airway protection, \\nblood pressure support, and strong consideration of video-EEG \\nmonitoring to evaluate for ongoing subclinical seizures; see \\nTABLE 181.5 Management of Status Epilepticus\\nSTABILIZATION\\nABCs (airway, breathing, circulation)\\nCardiac monitoring\\nOxygen and pulse oximetry\\nIntravenous access\\nImmediate laboratory tests\\n Glucose\\n Basic metabolic panel—sodium, calcium, magnesium\\n Anticonvulsant drug levels\\n Toxicology studies as appropriate\\n Complete blood counts, platelets, and differential\\nPHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT\\nBenzodiazepine (max rate of administration =  1 mg/min)\\n Lorazepam IV, IN 0.1  mg/kg (maximum 4  mg per dose)\\n Diazepam IV, PR 0.15-0.2  mg/kg (maximum 10  mg per dose)\\n Rectal diazepam 0.2-0.5  mg/kg (maximum 20  mg per dose)\\n Midazolam IV, IM, IN, buccal 0.1-0.2  mg/kg (maximum 10  mg \\nper dose)\\nStandard anticonvulsant medications\\n Fosphenytoin IV, IM 20  mg/kg (phenytoin equivalents; \\nmaximum 1,500 PE per dose)\\n Phenobarbital IV 20  mg/kg (maximum 1,000  mg per dose)\\n Levetiracetam IV 60  mg/kg (maximum 4,500  mg per dose)\\n Valproic acid IV, PR 20  mg/kg (maximum 3,000  mg per dose)\\nContinuous infusions\\n Pentobarbital\\n Midazolam\\nGeneral anesthesia\\nIM, Intramuscularly; IN, intranasally; IV, intravenous; PE, phenytoin; PR, per rectum.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

For most children, \\nmedications can be weaned off after 2 years without seizures. \\nThere are some exceptions. For example, children with JME, \\nprogressive myoclonic epilepsy, atypical absence seizures, and \\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome usually require lifelong treatment. \\nChildren who have other neurological comorbidities, seizures \\nthat were initially difficult to control, or persistently epilepti-\\nform EEGs are at highest risk for recurrence when therapy is \\ndiscontinued.\\nAlthough cognitively normal children with epilepsy have \\nthe same rates of injury as normal healthy children, there are \\nimportant safety considerations for people with epilepsy. The risk \\nof drowning is high, so swimming and bathing must only occur \\nunder direct adult supervision. Children should use appropriate \\nhelmets for sports such as bicycling or ice skating. There is no \\ncontraindication to participation in contact sports, but scuba \\ndiving, hang gliding, and free climbing are not safe for people \\nwith epilepsy. Each country and individual states have specific \\nlaws regarding driving for people with epilepsy. Most require \\na period of seizure freedom before driving.\\nCHAPTER 182 \\nWeakness and Hypotonia\\nWeakness is a decreased ability to voluntarily and actively move \\nmuscles. This may be generalized or localized to one aspect of \\nthe body. Hypotonia is a state of low muscle resistance to \\nmovement. Hypotonia can be associated with weakness, but \\nin some cases is present with normal motor strength. The \\ndifferential diagnosis for weakness is extensive (Table 182.1).\\nETIOLOGY\\nWeakness and hypotonia may be due to disorders of upper \\nmotor neurons or lower motor neurons. Upper motor neurons \\nof the recurrence risk is based on the clinical history and \\nneurodiagnostic testing (Table 181.6). If the recurrence risk \\nis 75% or greater, it is usually suggested that daily medication \\nbe prescribed. Absence seizures, infantile spasms, atypical \\nabsence seizures, and atonic seizures are universally recur-\\nrent at the time of diagnosis, so treatment should be initiated  \\nimmediately.\\nThe goal of treatment is to maintain an optimal functional \\nstate. Medication toxicity should be weighed against the risk \\nof the seizures. Initial drug selection is based on the seizure \\ntype (Fig. 181.1). Using a single agent limits toxicity, contains \\ncost, and improves compliance. Approximately 60% of children \\nobtain satisfactory seizure control and minimal side effects \\nwith the initial drug. If seizure control is not achieved, despite \\ngood compliance, addition of a second drug is considered. \\nMeasuring anticonvulsant blood levels can sometimes be \\nhelpful in adjusting dosing and monitoring compliance. Levels \\nshould be interpreted in light of the patient’s clinical state; a \\npatient with a “low” drug level who is seizure free does not \\nnecessarily need a higher dose. Anticonvulsant drug levels \\nshould be drawn at trough, usually before the morning doses. \\nWhen hepatic or renal disease is present, especially in critically \\nill children, protein binding of medications is often altered \\nand measurements of free and total anticonvulsant levels can  \\nbe helpful.\\nTABLE 181.6 Recurrence Risk After a First Unprovoked \\nSeizure*\\nSEIZURE \\nTYPE\\nEEG \\nNORMAL, \\nEXAM \\nNORMAL\\nEEG \\nEPILEPTIFORM \\nOR EXAM \\nABNORMAL\\nBOTH EEG \\nAND EXAM \\nABNORMAL\\nGeneralized 25% 50% 75%\\nFocal 50% 75% >90%\\n*Most recurrences occur within 2 years\\nEEG, Electroencephalographic.\\nFocal seizures Generalized seizures\\nOxcarbazepine\\nCarbamazepine\\nPhenytoin\\nLacosamide\\nClobazam\\nFelbamate\\nLamotrigine\\nLevetiracetam\\nPhenobarbital\\nRufinamide\\nTopiramate\\nValproic Acid\\nZonisamide\\nKetogenic Diet\\nEpilepsy surgery\\nSpecial circumstances: \\n1.

Dysfunc-\\ntion of the upper motor neuron causes loss of voluntary control, \\nbut not total loss of movement because motor nuclei of the \\nbasal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem have tracts that produce \\nsimple or complex stereotyped patterns of movement. The \\ncorticospinal tract permits fine motor activity and is best tested \\nby rapid alternating movements of the distal extremities. In \\nthe acute phase, upper motor neuron disorders cause hypotonia \\nand decreased deep tendon reflexes. Over time, spasticity and \\nhyperreflexia develop. Mild dysfunction produces slowed, stiff  \\nmotions. More severe dysfunction produces stiff, abnormal \\ninvoluntary postures and spasticity. A central lesion usually \\nresults in weakness that is more pronounced in the flexors of \\nthe lower extremities than in the extensors, so affected patients \\ntend to be spastic with legs extended and adducted. In the \\nupper extremities, the extensors are weaker than flexors, so \\nelbows and wrists are flexed.\\nDamage to the spinal cord leaves residual simple, stereotyped \\nreflex movements coordinated by local spinal reflexes below \\nthe level of the lesion.\\nDestruction of the lower motor neuron, the final common \\npathway producing muscle activity, leads to hypotonia and total \\nabsence of movement. Function is best tested by measuring the \\nstrength of individual muscle groups or, in a young child, by \\nobserving the ability to perform tasks requiring particular muscle \\ngroups (walk up or down stairs, arise from the ground, walk on \\ntoes or heels, raise the hands above the head, squeeze a ball). \\nWith lower motor neuron disorders, atrophy and fasciculations \\nare common and deep tendon reflexes are typically decreased \\nor absent.\\nDISEASE OF THE UPPER MOTOR NEURON\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nTumors, traumatic brain injury, infections, stroke, demyelinating \\nsyndromes, spinal cord trauma or mass, metabolic diseases, and \\nneurodegenerative diseases (see Chapters 100, 101, 157, 184, 185; \\nSection 10) may injure the brain or spinal cord, producing an \\nupper motor neuron pattern of weakness coupled with increased \\ndeep tendon reflexes, spasticity, and extensor plantar responses \\n(Babinski sign). In neonates, weakness with upper motor neuron \\npatterns may be caused by TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other [syphi-\\nlis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], rubella, cytomegalovirus, \\nand herpes) infections (see Chapter 66), developmental brain \\nanomalies, hemorrhage, stroke, hypoxia, genetic syndromes, \\nmetabolic/electrolyte disturbances, or toxic exposure.\\nTABLE 182.1 Disorders Causing Weakness in Infants and \\nChildren\\nANATOMICAL REGION CORRESPONDING DISORDERS\\nCentral nervous \\nsystem—brain\\nBrain tumor\\nTrauma (accidental, nonaccidental)\\nInfection (meningitis, encephalitis, \\nabscess, TORCH)\\nIschemia (arterial or venous)\\nHemorrhage\\nDemyelinating disease\\nMetabolic disease (leukodystrophy; \\ninborn error of metabolism; \\nmitochondrial encephalomyopathy, \\nlactic acidosis, and stroke-like \\nepisodes)\\nDegenerative disease\\nCentral nervous system—\\nspinal cord\\nTransverse myelitis\\nTumor\\nAbscess\\nTrauma\\nInfarction\\nAnterior horn cell Spinal muscular atrophy\\nPoliomyelitis\\nPeripheral nerve Guillain-Barré syndrome\\nHereditary motor sensory neuropathy\\nTick paralysis\\nBell palsy\\nNeuromuscular\\tjunction Myasthenia\\tgravis \\t(juvenile, \\ttransient \\t\\nneonatal, congenital)\\nBotulism\\nMuscle Muscular dystrophies (Duchenne, \\nBecker, limb-girdle)\\nMyotonic dystrophies\\nCongenital myopathies\\nMetabolic myopathies\\nDermatomyositis\\nPolymyositis\\nTORCH, Toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], rubella, \\ncytomegalovirus, and herpes.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nHypotonia and Weakness\\nTABLE 182.2 Clinical Distinction Between Upper Motor \\nNeuron and Lower Motor Neuron Lesions\\nCLINICAL \\nSIGN\\nUPPER MOTOR \\nNEURON \\n(CORTICOSPINAL \\nTRACT)\\nLOWER MOTOR \\nNEURON \\n(NEUROMUSCULAR)\\nTone Increased (spastic) Decreased\\nReflexes Increased Decreased\\nBabinski reflex Present Absent\\nAtrophy Possible Possible\\nFasciculations Absent Possible\\noriginate in the cerebral motor cortex; their axons form the \\ncorticospinal tract ending in the spinal cord and control vol -\\nuntary motor activity.

Children may present with \\na variety of symptoms and signs including acute optic neuritis, \\nhemiparesis, ataxia, seizures, headache, weakness, or dysphagia. \\nThe pathophysiology resembles that of multiple sclerosis. An \\nimportant difference is that children with ADEM have encepha-\\nlopathy. Although multiple sclerosis is most commonly diagnosed \\nin adulthood, childhood cases have been increasingly recognized. \\nADEM and multiple sclerosis exacerbations are treated with \\nhigh-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). \\nPhysical and occupational therapies are often helpful.\\nAcute spinal cord lesions, such as infarction or compres-\\nsion, may produce a flaccid, areflexic paralysis that mimics \\nlower motor neuron disease. A child who exhibits an acute or \\nsubacute flaccid paraparesis is most likely to have an acute cord \\nsyndrome or Guillain-Barré syndrome. The hallmarks of spinal \\ncord disease are a sensory level and a motor level of impairment, \\ndisturbance of bowel and bladder function, and local spinal pain \\nor tenderness. Patients may be bradycardic and hypotensive due \\nto neurogenic shock. The acute cord syndrome may be the result \\nof infection, cord tumor, infarction, demyelination, or trauma. \\nTransverse myelitis, an acute postinfectious demyelinating \\ndisorder of the spinal cord, is treated with high-dose steroids. \\nSymptoms of an epidural abscess include fever, spinal pain, \\nand neurological deficits. Trauma and tumors (neuroblastoma, \\nlymphoma, sarcoma) compressing the spinal cord necessitate \\nimmediate neurosurgical management to preserve vital function. \\nLesions of the spinal cord are best delineated with magnetic \\nresonance imaging (MRI).\\nDISEASES OF THE LOWER MOTOR NEURON\\nNeuromuscular disease affects any component of the lower \\nmotor neuron unit. The distribution of muscle weakness can \\npoint toward specific diseases (Table 182.3).\\nSpinal Muscular Atrophy\\nEtiology\\nProgressive degeneration of anterior horn cells is the key \\nmanifestation of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic \\ndisease with signs and symptoms that may begin in intrauterine \\nlife or any time thereafter. About 25% of patients have a severe \\ninfantile form (SMA type 1/Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), 50% \\nhave a late infantile and more slowly progressive form (SMA \\ntype 2/Kugelberg-Welander syndrome), and 25% have a more \\nchronic, juvenile form (SMA type 3). SMA is one of the most \\nfrequent autosomal recessive diseases, with a carrier frequency \\nof 1 in 50.\\nThe earlier in life the signs develop, the more severe the progres-\\nsion. Infants with SMA type 1 present in early infancy with \\nsevere hypotonia, generalized weakness, and facial involvement. \\nInfants have normal cognitive, social, and language skills and \\nsensation. Fasciculations (quivering muscle movements that \\nare typically best seen on the lateral aspect of the tongue) are \\nbest identified by inspecting the mouth when the child is asleep. \\nDeep tendon reflexes are absent. With disease progression, \\nbreathing becomes rapid, shallow, and predominantly abdominal. \\nIn an extremely weak child, respiratory compromise leads to \\natelectasis, pulmonary infection, and death. Most infants with \\nSMA type 1 die within the first 2 years. Children with SMA \\ntype 2 may survive to adulthood. Children with SMA type 3 \\ncan initially appear normal with slower progression of weakness \\nand a normal life expectancy.\\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Studies\\nThe diagnosis of SMA is made by genetic testing. Creatine \\nphosphokinase (CK) may be normal or mildly elevated. \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Pulmonary \\nand cardiac functions are monitored continuously. Endotracheal \\nintubation is required by patients with impending respiratory \\nfailure or an inability to clear secretions. Most patients are treated \\ninitially with IVIG. Plasma exchange and immunosuppressive \\ndrugs are alternatives when IVIG is unsuccessful or in rapidly \\nprogressive disease. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies \\nare mainstays of treatment.\\nThe illness usually resolves spontaneously, albeit slowly; \\n80% of patients recover normal function within 1-12 months. \\nTwenty percent of patients are left with mild to moderate residual \\nweakness. Some children will suffer acute relapse or chronic \\nsymptoms.\\nChronic Inflammatory Demyelinating \\nPolyneuropathy\\nCIDP is an immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy and can \\naffect patients of all ages. Patients present with both proximal \\nand distal weakness (usually in an episodic, relapsing-remitting \\npattern) affecting the extremities. Patients may also experience \\nsensation changes such as numbness, tingling, or pain. The \\ndiagnosis is clinical, although EMG or nerve biopsy may confirm \\nthe diagnosis. The mainstays of treatment for CIDP are IVIG, \\nglucocorticoids, and plasmapheresis. Prognosis varies; some \\npatients have complete remission, whereas others experience \\npartial remission or severe persistent disability.\\nHereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy\\nHMSN (also called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease [CMT]) is a \\ngroup of progressive peripheral nerve diseases. Motor compo-\\nnents generally dominate the clinical picture, with sensation \\nand autonomic functions affected later. Some subtypes present \\nwith severe symptoms starting in infancy while other forms \\nmay have milder symptoms.\\nThe peroneal and tibial nerves are the earliest and most \\nseverely affected. Most often, complaints begin in the pre -\\nschool to early adolescent years, with weakness of the \\nankles and frequent tripping. Examination shows pes cavus \\ndeformity of the feet (high-arched feet), bilateral weakness \\nof foot dorsiflexors, and normal sensation despite occasional \\ncomplaints of paresthesia. Peripheral nerves can become mark-\\nedly enlarged and may be palpable on exam. Progression of \\nHMSN is slow, extending over years and decades. Eventually, \\npatients develop weakness and atrophy of the entire lower \\nlegs and hands and mild to moderate sensory loss in the \\nhands and feet. Some patients never have more than a mild \\nfoot deformity, loss of ankle reflexes, and electrophysiological \\nabnormalities. Others in the same family may be confined to a \\nwheelchair and have difficulties performing everyday tasks with  \\ntheir hands.\\nHMSN can be characterized by demyelination (CMT1) or \\naxonal (CMT2) damage. Specific genetic testing is available for \\nmany subtypes of HMSN. Specific treatment for HMSN is not avail-\\nable, but braces that maintain the feet in dorsiflexion can improve  \\nfunction.\\nTick Paralysis\\nElectromyelogram (EMG) shows fasciculations, fibrillations, \\nand other signs of denervation. Muscle biopsy specimens show \\ngrouped atrophy.\\nTreatment\\nNo specific treatment delays progression of SMA, although a \\nnumber of promising agents including nusinersen, an antisense \\noligonucleotide, are being studied. Symptomatic therapy is \\ndirected toward minimizing contractures, preventing scoliosis, \\noptimizing nutrition, and avoiding infections. Respiratory \\ninfections are managed early and aggressively with pulmonary \\nhygiene, oxygen, and antibiotics. The use or nonuse of artificial \\nventilation and tube feedings must be individualized for each \\npatient in each stage of the illness.\\nPeripheral Neuropathy\\nThere are many peripheral nerve diseases in childhood, but \\nthe most classic presentations are Guillain-Barré syndrome, \\nchronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), \\nhereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN), and tick \\nparalysis. Peripheral neuropathies produced by diabetes mellitus, \\nalcoholism, chronic renal failure, exposure to toxins, vasculitis, \\nand the effects of neoplasm are common in adults but are rare \\nin children.\\nGuillain-Barré Syndrome\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating \\npolyradiculoneuropathy) is a postinfectious autoimmune \\nperipheral neuropathy that can occur about 10 days after a \\nrespiratory or gastrointestinal infection (classically Mycoplasma \\npneumonia or Campylobacter jejuni). It occurs in people of all \\nages and is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis \\nin children.\\nThe characteristic symptoms are areflexia, flaccidity, and \\nsymmetrical ascending weakness. Progression can occur rapidly, \\nin hours, or more indolently over weeks. Typically, symptoms \\nstart with numbness or paresthesia in the hands and feet, then \\na heavy, weak feeling in the legs. Weakness ascends to involve \\nthe arms, trunk, and bulbar muscles (tongue, pharynx, larynx). \\nDeep tendon reflexes are absent even when strength is relatively \\npreserved. Objective signs of sensory loss are usually minor \\ncompared with the dramatic weakness. Bulbar and respiratory \\ninsufficiency may progress rapidly. Dysfunction of autonomic \\nnerves can lead to blood pressure changes, tachycardia and \\nother arrhythmias, urinary retention or incontinence, or stool \\nretention. This polyneuropathy can be difficult to distinguish \\nfrom an acute spinal cord syndrome. Preservation of bowel \\nand bladder function, loss of arm reflexes, absence of a sensory \\nlevel, and lack of spinal tenderness point toward Guillain-Barré \\nsyndrome. A cranial nerve variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome \\ncalled the Miller Fisher variant manifests with ataxia, partial \\nophthalmoplegia, and areflexia.\\nThe cerebrospinal fluid in Guillain-Barré syndrome is \\nsometimes normal early in the illness but classically shows \\nelevated protein levels without significant pleocytosis.

Others have \\na progressive and potentially life-threatening illness that involves \\nall musculature, including that of respiration and swallowing. \\nTreatment includes pyridostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase \\ninhibitor) and, depending on severity, various forms of \\nimmunosuppression.\\nTransient Neonatal Myasthenia Gravis\\nA transient myasthenic syndrome develops in the first hours \\nto days after birth in neonates born to mothers with myasthenia \\ngravis. Almost all infants born to mothers with myasthenia \\nhave maternal anti-AChR antibodies, but only 10-20% will \\ndevelop signs. Signs include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, weak \\nfacial movements, poor feeding, hypotonia, respiratory difficulty, \\nand variable extremity weakness. Neonates with transient \\nmyasthenia gravis require cholinesterase inhibitors and sup-\\nportive care for a few days to weeks until the weakness remits.\\nCongenital Myasthenia Gravis\\nA variety of rare disorders of the neuromuscular junction have \\nbeen reported that are not autoimmune mediated. The congenital \\nmyasthenic syndromes (CMS) are due to gene mutations in \\nthe components of the neuromuscular junction. They typically \\npresent in infancy with hypotonia, ophthalmoparesis, facial \\ndiplegia, and extremity weakness, although they can present \\nthroughout childhood. Respiratory function and feeding may \\nbe compromised. Children with CMS usually have lifelong \\ndisability. Some children will respond to pyridostigmine or \\nother drugs that improve neuromuscular junction function.\\nInfant botulism results from intestinal infection by Clostridium \\nbotulinum, which produces a neurotoxin that blocks presynaptic \\ncholinergic transmission. Y oung age and the absence of competi-\\ntive bowel flora predispose infants to this disease. Infants may \\ningest dust, soil, or food (honey or poorly canned foods) \\ncontaminated with spores. The progressive neuromuscular \\nblockade ranges from mild to severe. Infants typically present \\nwith constipation and poor feeding. Hypotonia and weakness \\ndevelop progressively, along with cranial nerve dysfunction \\nmanifested by decreased gag reflex, diminished eye movements, \\ndecreased pupillary contraction, and ptosis. Heart rate and \\nblood pressure may fluctuate. Affected infants may develop \\nrespiratory failure. The diagnosis is made by detecting C. botu-\\nlinum spores and toxin in stool samples. Therapy with botulism \\nIVIG should be administered as soon as the diagnosis is sus -\\npected. With prompt treatment and respiratory and supportive \\ncare, the prognosis is good.\\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy\\nMuscular dystrophies are a group of genetic muscle diseases \\ncharacterized by progressive myofiber degeneration and the \\ngradual replacement of muscle by fibrotic tissue. Duchenne \\nmuscular dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy \\nand one of the most common genetic disorders of \\nchildhood.\\nEtiology\\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder (Xp21) \\nthat arises from a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Approxi-\\nmately 1 in 3,500 boys is affected.

Infants are immobile and hypotonic, with ptosis, absence \\nof sucking and Moro reflexes, poor feeding, and respiratory \\ndifficulties. Often, weakness and atony of uterine smooth muscle \\nduring labor lead to associated hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy \\nand its sequelae, which make the clinical diagnosis more difficult. \\nThe presence of congenital contractures, clubfoot, or a history \\nof poor fetal movements indicates intrauterine neuromuscular \\ndisease. Those requiring prolonged ventilation have an infant \\nmortality of 25%. Individuals with congenital DM often make \\nsignificant gains in terms of motor skills, and nearly all children \\neventually ambulate independently. However, approximately 50% \\nof DM patients have mental retardation. In addition, children \\nwith congenital DM experience a second progressive phase of \\nthe disease in the teen years, including potentially fatal cardiac \\narrhythmias. Diagnosis is established by genetic testing.\\nOther Forms of Childhood Muscle Disease\\nCongenital muscular dystrophies  (CMDs) refer to a group \\nof genetically determined conditions that present in infancy \\nor early childhood. The most common subtypes include merosin-\\ndeficient CMD, Ullrich CMD, and the dystroglycanopathies. \\nThe characteristic clinical features include hypotonia, extremity \\nweakness, delayed motor development, and congenital con -\\ntractures. Contractures and scoliosis are often progressive and \\nseverely worsen; respiratory status diminishes with age. \\nDiagnosis is established through the combination of elevated \\nserum CK and dystrophic changes detected on muscle biopsy. \\nEmery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy  (EDMD), also known \\nas humeroperoneal muscular dystrophy, can be inherited as \\nan X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal \\nrecessive disorder. Symptoms typically begin in childhood, \\nalthough adult onset has been noted. Patients may experience \\nearly contractures, slowly progressive humeroperoneal muscle \\nweakness or wasting, and cardiac disease with conduction \\ndefects and arrhythmias. EDMD is associated with mild eleva-\\ntions of serum CK levels, abnormal electrocardiograms (ECG), \\ncharacteristic changes on muscle imaging, and abnormal but \\nnonspecific muscle biopsies. There are no disease-specific \\nmodifying therapies for EDMD, although early placement of \\ndefibrillators in patients with abnormal ECGs reduces the \\nincidence of sudden death.\\nSeveral forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), \\nusually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, have been \\ndescribed. Depending on the subtype of LGMD, presentation \\ncan be throughout childhood. A subset of children will have a \\nDuchenne-like presentation. LGMD primarily affects muscles of \\nthe hip and shoulder girdles. Distal muscles may later become \\nweak and atrophic; some children have progressive cardiac and \\nrespiratory failure.\\nFacioscapulohumeral dystrophy is an autosomal dominant \\nmyopathy. Weakness first appears in the facial and shoulder \\ngirdle muscles. Shoulder weakness results in the characteristic \\nobservation of scapular winging, which can often be asymmetri-\\ncal. Patients have mild ptosis, a decrease in facial expression, \\ninability to pucker the lips or close eyes during sleep, neck \\nweakness, difficulty in fully elevating the arms, and thinness \\nof upper arm musculature.\\nCongenital myopathies (CM) are a group of nondystrophic \\nmuscle disorders that, like CMDs, most typically present in \\ninfancy with hypotonia and weakness. Additional signs and \\nsymptoms include congenital contractures, hip subluxation/\\nBoys are only rarely symptomatic in early infancy. At about \\n2-3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability \\nto run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild delay \\nin attaining motor milestones or of poor head control during \\ninfancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild \\nto moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, wad-\\ndling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on \\nthe floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower \\nsign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years. Most boys are \\nwheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations \\ninclude cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and \\ncognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne \\nlive into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually \\nas a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac \\ndysfunction.\\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Studies\\nSerum CK levels are always markedly elevated. Diagnosis is \\nestablished by genetic testing for the dystrophin gene mutation. \\nApproximately one-third of cases represent new mutations. \\nPrenatal genetic testing is possible, and newborn screening for \\nelevated CK is available in some states. Occasionally the \\ndiagnosis is not made until a muscle biopsy shows muscle fiber \\ndegeneration and regeneration accompanied by increased \\nintrafascicular connective tissue.\\nTreatment\\nChronic oral steroid therapy is now instituted to slow the pace \\nof the disease, delay motor disability, and improve longevity. \\nSupportive care includes physical therapy, bracing, proper \\nwheelchairs, and treatment of cardiac dysfunction or pulmonary \\ninfections. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended.\\nMyotonic Dystrophy\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nMyotonic dystrophy (DM) is the second most common muscular \\ndystrophy and the most common form to present in adulthood. \\nAn autosomal dominant genetic disease, DM is caused by \\nprogressive expansion of a triplet repeat, CTG, in the DM protein \\nkinase gene. Presentation is roughly correlated with the number \\nof CTG repeats, and the disease is characterized by genetic \\nanticipation, where each generation presents with earlier and \\nmore severe symptoms.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nAlthough DM most typically presents in adulthood, it can \\npresent at any age. Clinical features of childhood-onset “classic” \\nDM include slowly progressive facial and distal extremity \\nweakness as well as myotonia. Myotonia is a disorder of muscle \\nrelaxation after contraction. When patients grasp onto an object, \\nthey have difficulty releasing their grasp and may appear to \\npeel their fingers away slowly. The facial appearance is char -\\nacteristic, with hollowing of muscles around temples, jaw, and \\nneck; ptosis; facial weakness; and drooping of the lower lip. \\nThe voice is nasal and mildly dysarthric. Not only is the striated \\nmuscle affected, but smooth muscle of the alimentary tract and \\ncardiac muscle are involved. Patients have variable arrhythmias, \\nendocrinopathies, immunological deficiencies, cataracts, and \\nintellectual impairment.\\nA severe congenital form of DM can appear in infants of \\nmothers with DM because of rapid expansion of the CTG repeat \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Clinical findings may distinguish CMDs and \\nother dystrophies (involvement of the facial musculature in \\nCM). Diagnosis is ultimately established based on laboratory \\nstudies, biopsy findings, and genetic test results. Histopatho-\\nlogical subtypes are distinguished by characteristic features on \\nmuscle biopsy, the most common being nemaline myopathy, \\ncentronuclear myopathy, and core myopathy. Although no \\nspecific therapies currently exist for any CM subtype, several \\npromising therapies have shown efficacy in preclinical models  \\nof disease.\\nMetabolic Myopathies\\nGlycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) and muscle \\ncarnitine deficiency are discussed in Chapters 52 and 55. Several \\nmitochondrial myopathies may present with hypotonia, \\nophthalmoplegia, and progressive weakness, but the pheno-\\ntype of these disorders is broad (see Chapter 57). Endocrine \\nmyopathies, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, \\nhyperparathyroidism, and Cushing syndrome, are associated \\nwith proximal muscle weakness (see Chapters 175, 176, and \\n178). Periodic paralysis due to familial forms of hypokalemia \\nor hyperkalemia produces episodic weakness.\\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Studies\\nThe diagnostic evaluation should be guided by the clinical \\nhistory and physical examination (see Chapter 179).\\nMalignant Hyperthermia\\nMalignant hyperthermia is a life-threatening syndrome \\nmanifested by a rapid increase of body temperature, muscle \\nrigidity, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, hypotension, \\narrhythmias, and convulsions. Acute episodes are precipitated \\nby exposure to anesthetic agents in patients with a genetic \\npredisposition. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, \\ncentral core myopathy, and other myopathies are susceptible, \\nalthough malignant hyperpyrexia can also occur in children \\nwithout muscle disease as an autosomal dominant genetic \\ndisorder. A family history of unexplained death during anesthesia \\nis often noted. Serum CK levels rise and myoglobinuria can \\nresult in tubular necrosis and acute renal failure. Diagnosis of \\nidiopathic malignant hyperthermia is possible with genetic \\ntesting or an in vitro muscle contraction test that reveals exces-\\nsive tonic contracture on exposure to halothane and caffeine. \\nTreatment consists of dantrolene, sodium bicarbonate, and \\ncooling.\\nNEONATAL AND INFANTILE HYPOTONIA\\nThe clinical distinction between upper and lower motor neuron \\ndisorders in infants is blurred because incomplete myeliniza-\\ntion of the developing nervous system limits expression of \\nmany of the cardinal signs, such as spasticity.

A wide spectrum of conditions can produce stroke \\nin childhood (Table 182.4). Pediatric strokes may be due to \\nischemia (arterial ischemic stroke [AIS], cerebral sinovenous \\nthrombosis [CSVT]) or hemorrhage. AIS is focal brain infarc-\\ntion that results from occlusion of the arteries in the brain. \\nThe most common causes are vasculitis resulting in abnormal \\ncerebral arteries (either autoimmune or infectious, such as \\nvasculitis associated with meningitis) and cardioembolic infarcts \\ndue to congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, or coagulation \\ndisorders. Coagulation disorders also increase the risk of CSVT, \\nthe occlusion of venous structures in the brain, which can \\nresult in ischemia as the cerebral venous pressure rises. CSVT \\ncan also be caused by infections or dehydration. Hemorrhagic \\nstrokes (HS) may be intraparenchymal (primary or secondary \\nbleeding after AIS) or associated with intraventricular, sub-\\narachnoid, subdural, or epidural bleeds. The most common \\ncauses of HS are vascular malformations, head trauma, and \\nvasculitis.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nThe acute onset of focal neurological deficits in a child is stroke \\nuntil proven otherwise. Symptoms may be subtle and nonspecific, \\nwhich can lead to a delay in diagnosis. AIS typically presents \\nwith acute, focal neurological deficits. Hemiparesis is most \\ncommon, but visual, speech, sensory, or balance deficits may \\nbe present. Unlike AIS in adults, focal seizures are quite common \\nin childhood presentation of AIS. Similarly, neonatal AIS most \\noften presents with acute symptomatic focal seizures (typically \\nin the first day of life) or encephalopathy.\\nSymptoms of CSVT may progress more gradually and be \\nmore variable and nonspecific than AIS. In CSVT, acute focal \\ndeficits may be present or the child may have progressive signs of \\nTABLE 182.4 Causes of Stroke in Childhood\\nARTERIAL ISCHEMIC STROKE\\nArteriopathic\\n•\\t Idiopathic\\tarterial \\tstenosis\\n•\\t Vasculitis\\t(autoimmune \\tor \\tinfectious; \\tmay \\tbe \\tfocal \\tor \\t\\ndiffuse)\\n•\\t Arterial\\tdissection \\t(traumatic \\tor \\tspontaneous)\\n•\\t Moyamoya\\tdisease\\nCardiac\\n•\\t Cyanotic\\tcongenital \\theart \\tdisease\\n•\\t Valvular\\tdisease\\n•\\t Patent\\tforamen \\tovale\\n•\\t Arrhythmias\\n•\\t Cardiomyopathy\\n•\\t Infective\\tendocarditis\\nHematological\\n•\\t Sickle\\tcell \\tanemia\\n•\\t Iron-deficiency\\tanemia\\n•\\t Hypercoagulable\\tstate\\n•\\t Hereditary\\tprothrombotic \\tstates \\t(factor \\tV \\tLeiden)\\n•\\t Acquired\\tprothrombotic \\tstates \\t(antiphospholipid \\t\\nantibodies)\\n•\\t Prothrombotic\\tmedications \\t(oral \\tcontraception)\\nCEREBRAL SINOVENOUS THROMBOSIS\\nHematological\\n•\\t Hypercoagulable\\tstates \\t(see \\tabove)\\n•\\t Iron-deficiency\\tanemia\\n•\\t Severe\\tdehydration\\nInfections\\n•\\t Meningitis\\n•\\t Otitis\\tmedia\\n•\\t Mastoiditis\\nSystemic disease\\n•\\t Leukemia\\n•\\t Inflammatory\\tbowel \\tdisease\\n•\\t Nephrotic\\tsyndrome\\nTrauma\\nHEMORRHAGIC STROKE\\nHead trauma (accidental or abusive)\\nVascular malformations\\n•\\t Arteriovenous\\tmalformations\\n•\\t Cerebral\\taneurysms\\nBrain tumor\\nVasculitis\\nMoyamoya disease\\nelevated intracranial pressure, including headache, papilledema, \\ndiplopia (most often from cranial nerve VI palsy), seizures, \\nlethargy, or confusion.\\nHS tends to present acutely, with a sudden “thunderclap” \\nheadache.

Appendicular ataxia \\nreflects disturbances of the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere \\n(cystic cerebellar astrocytoma).

Other causes include benign \\nparoxysmal vertigo, head trauma, seizures, postictal states, \\nmigraine, paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome \\nassociated with neuroblastoma, and inborn errors of metabolism. \\nCongenital disorders also may produce chronic, nonprogressive \\nataxia. There are a number of inherited ataxia syndromes  \\n(Table 183.1).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nunremarkable, so the timing of the stroke typically remains \\nuncertain.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThere are many conditions that mimic pediatric stroke, most \\nof which are more common than AIS, HS, or CSVT. Some of \\nthese mimics are benign (migraine, psychogenic weakness, \\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities), but others require specific, \\nprompt diagnosis and treatment (transient postictal weakness, \\nintracranial infection, inflammatory disease of the central \\nnervous system, tumor, posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy \\nsyndrome).\\nDiagnostic Tests and Imaging\\nOn initial presentation, acute neuroimaging is necessary. A \\nnoncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan is highly \\nsensitive to acute HS and can reveal larger, mature AIS; acute, \\nnonhemorrhagic stroke may not be seen on routine CT. \\nTherefore MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is required \\nfor most presentations. Angiography by magnetic resonance \\nangiography (MRA) or CT angiography is used to confirm arte-\\nrial occlusion in AIS and can identify underlying arteriopathy, \\nvascular malformations, and aneurysms. Diagnosis of CSVT \\nrequires a high clinical suspicion and purposeful imaging of \\nthe cerebral venous system by MRI or CT. If clinical assessment \\ndoes not reveal the cause of the stroke, a complete labora-\\ntory investigation should be undertaken promptly based on \\nsuspected etiologies (see Table 182.4). Many children with \\nAIS have more than one predisposing factor, so identifying \\none risk factor does not obviate the need for a complete  \\nevaluation.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment must focus on limiting secondary neuronal injury \\nand prevention of future strokes. Neuroprotection by main-\\ntaining control of temperature, blood pressure, glucose, and \\nseizures is essential. Emergency thrombolysis with medications \\nor catheterization is not yet established for children; it is an \\narea of active clinical research. Anticoagulants (IV heparin, \\nsubcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, oral warfarin) \\nand platelet antiaggregants (aspirin) are used for secondary \\nstroke prevention in some instances. For those with acute, \\nprogressive CSVT, anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy. \\nLong-term rehabilitation programs are required for most  \\nsurvivors.\\nCHAPTER 183 \\nAtaxia and Movement \\nDisorders\\nATAXIA\\nAtaxia is the inability to make accurate, smooth, and coordinated \\nmovements.

Arousal represents the \\nsystem that initiates and maintains consciousness and is medi-\\nated by the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which \\nextends from the pons through the midbrain to the hypothala-\\nmus and thalamus. Lethargic patients have difficulty maintaining \\nan aroused state. Patients who are obtunded have decreased \\narousal but are responsive to stimuli. Stupor is a state of \\nresponsiveness to pain but not to other stimuli. Coma is a state \\nof unresponsive unconsciousness and is caused by dysfunction \\nof the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, the brainstem, or both.\\nAcute Disorders of Consciousness\\nsigns. It may be seen in virtually all the disorders mentioned as \\ncauses of chorea. Many children with mixed forms of cerebral \\npalsy have spasticity and choreoathetosis.\\nDystonia is characterized by abnormally sustained muscle \\ncontraction, causing twisting motions (torsion spasm) and \\nrepetitive movements or abnormal postures, usually associated \\nwith basal ganglia or thalamic lesions. Cerebral palsy is the \\nmost common cause of dystonia among children, but many \\ngenetic mutations have been implicated in primary dystonias. \\nAntipsychotics and antiemetics can produce acute dystonic \\nreactions, typically involving the face and neck with torticol -\\nlis, retrocollis, tongue protrusions, and oculogyric crises (eye \\nrotation). Tardive dyskinesia is usually associated with chronic \\nantipsychotic drug use and presents with characteristic facial \\ninvolvement (tongue thrusting, chewing).\\nTremor is a hyperkinetic, rhythmic, oscillatory movement \\ncaused by simultaneous contractions of antagonistic muscles. \\nThe amplitude and frequency are regular. In children, tremor \\nis usually due to a physiological tremor, or essential tremor. \\nEssential tremor is the most common movement disorder in \\nadults, and half report onset in childhood. Other causes of \\ntremor include thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycemia, or drugs (caffeine, \\nbronchodilators, amphetamines, tricyclic antidepressants).\\nMyoclonus is a hyperkinetic, brief contraction of a muscle \\ngroup, resulting in a sudden jerk. Myoclonus may be caused by \\nseizures or by other etiologies (see Chapter 181). Nonepileptic \\nmyoclonus is distinguished from tremor in that it is a simple \\ncontraction of an agonist muscle, whereas tremor is a simultane-\\nous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. Myoclonus \\nis seen as a manifestation of various epilepsies and infectious, \\ntoxic, and metabolic encephalopathies. Benign myoclonus is \\ncommonly observed during sleep and may be particularly \\npronounced in neonates.\\nTics are rapid, purposeless, involuntary, stereotyped \\nmovements and typically involve the face, eyes, shoulder, and \\narm. Examples of simple motor tics include blinking, nose \\ntwitching, and extremity jerking. Complex motor tics are more \\norchestrated movements, including head shaking, gesturing, or \\njumping. Phonic tics may be simple (grunting, throat clearing) \\nor complex (uttering words, phrases). Approximately 25% of \\nchildren have transient tics. Most tic disorders in children are \\ntransient and not intrusive into the child’s life, but may be a \\nsource of parental anxiety. Occasionally, tics may be unmasked \\nby stimulant agents. Persistent motor tics (lasting >12 months) \\nin association with vocal tics are characteristic of Tourette \\nsyndrome, a chronic tic disorder that usually begins before \\nage 7 years. The pathophysiology underlying tics is unknown, \\nbut a family history of tics is elicited in more than 50% of \\ncases. Comorbid features, such as obsessive-compulsive \\ndisorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are \\npresent in half of children with Tourette disorder (see Chap-\\nters 13 and 19). Tic disorders are clinical diagnoses, and \\nneurodiagnostic studies have limited value. Many children \\nwith tic disorders or Tourette syndrome are unperturbed by \\ntheir tics and require no therapy. Others may benefit from \\npsychological support, including habit reversal training, and \\npharmacological therapy with α-adrenergic receptor agonists \\n(clonidine) or neuroleptics (pimozide, haloperidol, risperidone). \\nChronic tic disorders wax and wane regardless of intervention \\nand most often improve substantially or resolve entirely by  \\nlate adolescence.\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nAltered Mental Status\\nAcute changes in consciousness vary in degree from mild \\nlethargy and confusion to deep coma. In childhood, the most \\ncommon causes of coma are toxins, infections, head trauma, \\nhypoxia-ischemia (cardiac arrest, near-drowning), and seizures \\n(postictal state, subclinical status epilepticus; Table 184.1).\\nAssessment\\nThe most common cause of long-term morbidity in a patient \\nwith depressed consciousness is hypoxia; therefore, airway, \\nbreathing, and circulation are addressed first. Vital signs, \\nincluding pulse oximetry, must be assessed. Breathing patterns \\nmay provide important clues to the depth, neurological localiza-\\ntion, and etiology of the depressed consciousness. A low \\nrespiratory rate may be associated with central nervous system \\n(CNS) depressants or increased intracranial pressure (ICP). \\nTachypnea may be due to hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, or fever, \\nbut in more ominous situations may be due to brainstem \\nherniation. Systemic diseases such as sepsis, ingestions, or \\ncardiac failure may lead to shock. Hypotension may also result \\nfrom severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury. \\nHypertension may be due to increased ICP . The glucose level \\nshould also be checked immediately because hypoglycemia is \\na rapidly treatable cause of altered mental status. Physical \\nexamination searches for clues as to the cause of altered con-\\nsciousness, such as unusual odors, needle tracts, trauma, or \\nsigns of dehydration or organ system failure.\\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (see Table 42.1) can be used to \\nassess unresponsive patients regarding their best verbal and \\nmotor responses and eye opening to stimulation with scores \\nranging from 3-15 points.\\nDiminished levels of consciousness require either bilateral \\nhemispheric or ARAS dysfunction, so testing the structures \\nimmediately adjacent to the reticular system is essential.

A history of \\nsocial or emotional difficulties, drug abuse, or depression raises \\nconcern for self-inflicted injury or toxic ingestion. A subacute \\ncourse of somnolence progressing to difficulty arousing from \\na deep sleep (stupor) over hours suggests drug intoxication \\nor organ system failure (kidney, liver) producing a metabolic \\nencephalopathy. CNS infection, usually causes abrupt alteration \\nof mental status, although viral meningoencephalitis (particularly \\nherpes simplex virus) can present with subacute alterations \\nin mental status. The presence of fever, petechiae, chills, and \\nsweats suggests infection. Prodromal photophobia and pain \\non movement of the head or eyes are symptoms of meningeal \\nirritation. Premonitory symptoms, such as abdominal pain, \\ndiarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, cough, or rash, point toward \\nviral encephalitis or postinfectious syndrome as the cause of \\nthe altered consciousness.\\nStructural processes, such as hemorrhage, acute hydrocepha-\\nlus, or stroke, can cause sudden depressed consciousness in \\nchildren. An evolution of headache and morning vomiting \\nsuggests increased ICP . A gradual fading of alertness or \\ndeclining school performance over preceding weeks suggests \\nan expanding intracranial mass, subdural hematoma, or chronic \\ninfection (tuberculous meningitis, human immunodeficiency \\nvirus).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nPapilledema or paralysis of cranial nerves III or VI in a patient \\nwith depressed consciousness is strong evidence of elevated ICP , \\na medical and neurosurgical emergency. Herniations can occur \\nunder the falx, through the tentorial notch, or into the foramen \\nmagnum (Table 184.2). Recognition of the signs associated with \\nthe major herniation syndromes can be lifesaving if emergent \\nneuroimaging and treatment are initiated. Uncal herniation \\nimplies displacement of the mesial temporal lobe over the tento-\\nrial edge, producing a unilateral third nerve palsy (“blown pupil”) \\nand hemiparesis (which can be ipsilateral due to compression of \\nthe contralateral cerebral peduncle or contralateral if the uncus \\ncompresses the ipsilateral peduncle). Transtentorial (central) \\nherniation occurs with gradual downward pressure from the \\ndiencephalon through the tentorium, resulting in compression \\nof the brainstem (first midbrain, then progressing to pons and \\nmedulla). A progressive loss of consciousness accompanied by \\nin a flat, extended, unvarying position with eyes half-open \\nexhibit a deeper coma. An asymmetrical posture suggests motor \\ndysfunction of one side. This asymmetry may be subtle, such \\nas mild external rotation of the affected leg.\\nPosturing in response to noxious stimulation indicates \\nmore serious neurological conditions. Decorticate posturing \\nconsists of rigid extension of the lower extremities, flexion and \\nsupination of the arms, and fisting of the hands. It indicates \\nbilateral cortical or subcortical abnormalities or herniation, \\nwith preserved brainstem function. Decerebrate posturing \\n(rigid extension and internal rotation of the upper and lower \\nextremities) is associated with herniation with midbrain com-\\npression or toxic-metabolic abnormalities. These postures may \\nbe symmetrical or asymmetrical. A structural cause is most \\nlikely when posturing is asymmetrical, whereas symmetrical \\nposturing may suggest an underlying toxic-metabolic etiology.\\nEtiology\\nThe evolution of change in consciousness is an important clue \\nto the etiology. A detailed history and physical examination \\nusually provide sufficient clues to differentiate among the three \\nmajor diagnostic categories producing coma: metabolic/toxic, \\ninfectious, and structural. In most clinical situations, the cause \\nof coma is readily identified.\\nCare must be taken to investigate background medical condi-\\ntions that may produce a decline in consciousness (diabetes \\nmellitus, leukemia, kidney failure, liver disease). Metabolic \\nderangements are common causes of altered mental status \\nand are suggested by spontaneous fluctuations in the level of \\nconsciousness, tremors, myoclonus, asterixis, visual and tactile \\nhallucinations, and deep coma with preservation of pupillary light \\nreflexes. Disturbances of blood chemistries (glucose, sodium, \\ncalcium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia) may \\nproduce depressed mental status, as can hypoxemia (inadequate \\noxygen delivery to the brain) and cerebral ischemia (inadequate \\ncerebral perfusion). Acute metabolic or toxic disorders usually \\nproduce a hypotonic, limp state, but hypertonia, rigidity, and \\ndecorticate and decerebrate posturing are sometimes observed \\nin coma caused by hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and \\nshort-acting barbiturates.\\nIntoxication and ingestion are common causes of acute \\nalteration of consciousness.

Consciousness can be \\nimpaired during seizures or in the postictal state. Nonconvulsive \\n(subclinical) status epilepticus (generalized or focal) can directly \\nimpair consciousness and is a common complicating factor for \\ninfants and children with acute neurological disorders (head \\ntrauma, meningitis, stroke, following convulsive status epilep-\\nticus). Basilar artery or confusional migraines can last hours \\nand be accompanied by agitation, ataxia, cortical blindness, \\nvertigo, or cranial nerve palsies. Headache may precede or \\nfollow the neurological signs.\\nSyncope is one of the most common causes of abrupt, \\nepisodic loss of consciousness. Neurocardiogenic syncope, \\ncardiac arrhythmia, or obstructive cardiomyopathy can cause \\nrecurrent episodes of loss of consciousness. Two thirds of \\nchildren with syncope have irregular, myoclonic movements \\nas they lose consciousness (anoxic seizures), which must be \\ndistinguished from epilepsy (unprovoked seizures). Children \\nwith unexplained syncope require a complete cardiac evaluation \\n(see Chapter 140).\\nMetabolic derangements, particularly hypoglycemia, give \\nrise to episodes of lethargy, confusion, seizures, or coma. Several \\nother metabolic disorders cause recurrent bouts of hyperam-\\nmonemia (see Chapter 53). Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, \\nlethargy, confusion, ataxia, hyperventilation, and coma.\\nINCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE\\nEtiology\\nWhen the cranial sutures are fused, the skull becomes a rigid \\ncontainer enclosing a fixed volume, including the brain (80-85%), \\nCSF (10-15%), and blood (5-10%). The exponential relationship \\nbetween the volume within a closed container and pressure \\nresults in a massive increase in ICP as intracranial volume \\nincreases. The brain accommodates increased ICP initially by \\nexpelling CSF and blood from the intracranial compartment \\ninto the spinal subarachnoid space. When the limits of this \\naccommodation are reached, the brain itself begins to shift in \\nresponse to the continuing elevation of ICP . Brain shifts may \\ncause herniations across the dural extensions or skull barriers \\n(Table 184.2).\\nThe most common causes of increased ICP include mass \\nlesions, hydrocephalus, cerebral edema due to trauma or infec-\\ntion, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Tables 184.3 \\nand 184.4).\\nMass lesions (brain tumor, abscess, hemorrhage) may \\nproduce increased ICP not only by virtue of large size, but \\nby blockage of CSF pathways, blockage of venous outflow, or \\nproduction of vasogenic cerebral edema. Brain abscesses usually \\npresent as mass lesions, producing focal neurological signs and \\nincreased ICP . Symptoms of infection, including fever, malaise, \\nanorexia, and stiff neck, may be subtle or absent. Children with \\nchronic cardiac or pulmonary disease may embolize infected \\nmaterial to their brains, predisposing them to brain abscesses. \\nBrain tumors in children are most often located in the posterior \\nfossa and can result in elevated ICP due to obstruction of CSF \\nflow through the cerebral aqueduct and fourth ventricle. Brain \\nmiosis, decorticate posturing, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations \\n(rhythmic waxing and waning of respiratory amplitude) sug-\\ngests incipient transtentorial herniation. Late findings include \\ndecerebrate posturing and Cushing’s triad (bradycardia, irregular \\nrespirations, hypertension).\\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Imaging\\nEvaluation is guided by the history and physical examination. \\nClinicians should rapidly consider causes of unresponsiveness \\nthat could easily and quickly be reversed (see Table 184.1). If \\ntrauma or immersion injuries are suspected, neck manipulation \\nshould be avoided until cervical spine imaging excludes vertebral \\nfracture or subluxation.\\nComputed tomography (CT) remains the preferred imaging \\ntechnique in emergency situations because it can be performed \\nrapidly and accurately identifies intracranial acute hemorrhages, \\nlarge space-occupying lesions, edema, and shifts of the midline. \\nThe initial head CT scan is done without contrast to identify \\nblood and calcifications. Contrast can be administered to identify \\ninflammatory and neoplastic lesions but is not usually required \\nfor identification of major lesions.\\nExamination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may establish \\nthe cause of the alteration of consciousness. Lumbar puncture \\n(LP) in a patient with elevated ICP can result in transtentorial \\nherniation, so neuroimaging must be performed before LP \\nif elevated ICP is suspected, especially if there are any focal \\nneurological deficits on exam. The presence of red blood cells \\nin the CSF may suggest primary subarachnoid hemorrhage, \\nparenchymal hemorrhage, or hemorrhagic infection (herpes \\nsimplex virus), or it may be due to a traumatic procedure. \\nWhite blood cells in the CSF usually denote infectious men-\\ningitis or meningoencephalitis but may also be associated with \\nvasculitis, autoimmune disorders, or parainfectious syndromes. \\nElevated CSF protein is seen in patients with meningeal \\ninflammation, tumors, or white matter diseases, whereas \\nabnormal CSF glucose levels are also markers of infection and  \\ninflammation.\\nTreatment\\nBeyond supportive measures, the etiology of altered mental \\nstatus determines the treatment. Ingestions may necessitate \\ngastric lavage, charcoal administration, forced diuresis, dialysis, \\nor specific antidotes (see Chapter 45). Infections are treated with \\nappropriate antibiotics or antiviral agents (see Chapters 100, \\n101). If mental status changes are due to increased ICP , acute \\nmedical interventions (osmotic agents, steroids, a trial of hyper-\\nventilation, elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees) must \\nbe instituted, emergent neuroimaging performed, and urgent \\nneurosurgical consultation obtained. Structural brain lesions \\nmay necessitate medical treatment of increased ICP or surgical  \\nexcision.\\nPrognosis\\nThe outcome of altered mental status relates to many variables, \\nincluding etiology. Intoxication typically carries a good prog-\\nnosis, whereas herniation carries a poor prognosis. Other \\nprognostic factors include the duration of coma and the age \\nof the patient; children have better outcomes than adults. \\nComplete recovery from traumatic coma of several days’ duration \\nis possible in children; however, many survivors of prolonged \\ncoma are left in a persistent vegetative state or with severe \\nneuropsychiatric disability.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

A few \\npatients with meningitis, however, develop transtentorial hernia-\\ntion within a few hours of LP . Focal neurological signs, poorly \\nreactive pupils, and a tense fontanelle are contraindications to \\nLP in a patient with suspected bacterial meningitis.\\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor \\ncerebri) is a cause of increased ICP with normal brain imaging. \\nPatients exhibit a daily debilitating headache associated with \\ndiplopia, abducens palsy, transient visual obscurations, and \\npapilledema. If untreated, permanent visual field loss may \\ndevelop. The syndrome has been associated with ingestion of \\nmedications (tetracycline, vitamin A, oral contraceptive agents) \\nand endocrine disturbances (thyroid disease, Addison disease). \\nMost commonly, this condition is idiopathic and affects children \\nwho are otherwise well except for being overweight, with rapid \\nweight gain being a predisposing factor. Treatment including \\ntumors and abscesses can both result in vasogenic edema, which \\nfurther increases ICP .\\nHydrocephalus from congenital abnormalities or due to an \\nintracranial mass is typically characterized by a slowly evolving \\nsyndrome of increased ICP extending over weeks or months. \\nCSF is continuously produced by the choroid plexus within the \\nlateral, third, and fourth ventricles. CSF circulates through the \\nventricular systems and is then absorbed, predominantly by  \\nthe arachnoid villi into the large dural sinuses. Hydrocepha -\\nlus is due to the obstruction of CSF flow anywhere along \\nits course (see Table 184.4). Obstructive hydrocephalus is \\ncaused by a block before the CSF flows to the subarachnoid \\nspace, usually within the fourth ventricle or at the level of \\nthe aqueduct. Congenital hydrocephalus can result from \\nCNS malformations, intrauterine infection, intraventricular \\nhemorrhage, genetic defects, trauma, and teratogens. Acquired \\nhydrocephalus may be caused by CNS infections, brain \\ntumors, or hemorrhage. Impairment of CSF flow within the \\nsubarachnoid space or impairment of absorption is known \\nby the misnomer communicating hydrocephalus, where there \\nis actually extraventricular obstruction of CSF flow (external \\nhydrocephalus).

The first goal is stabilization of the \\ncardiopulmonary status. Once the child is stabilized, the head \\nis placed at midline and the head of the bed is elevated to 30 \\ndegrees. Indications for endotracheal intubation include refrac-\\ntory hypoxia, hypoventilation, Glasgow coma score of ≤8, loss \\nof airway protective reflexes, and acute herniation requiring \\ncontrolled hyperventilation. Slight hyperventilation (to a PaCO2 \\nnot lower than 35  mm H g) produces rapid, but transient, \\nreduction in ICP by cerebral vasoconstriction, leading to \\ndecreased cerebral blood volume. More aggressive hyperventila-\\ntion may cause cerebral ischemia and is only indicated if there \\nare clinical signs of acute herniation. Mannitol or 3% saline \\nmay be used acutely to produce an osmotic shift of fluid from \\nthe brain to the plasma. A ventricular catheter may be used to \\nmonitor the ICP continuously and to remove CSF . In refractory \\ncases, a pentobarbital-induced coma reduces pressure by severely \\nsuppressing cerebral metabolism. The antiinflammatory effects \\nof corticosteroids may be helpful in the management of vasogenic \\nedema associated with tumors and abscesses. Acetazolamide \\nand furosemide may transiently decrease CSF production in \\nidiopathic intracranial hypertension. Because acute interventions \\nsuch as hyperventilation, osmotic therapies, and barbiturates \\ncan have negative impacts on systemic and cerebral perfusion \\nand have only transient effects on ICP , they must be used \\njudiciously.\\nVasopressor drugs may be necessary to maintain adequate \\narterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Serum \\nelectrolytes and osmolarity should be monitored because of \\nrisk of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone or \\ncerebral salt wasting (Chapter 35). Maintaining normoglycemia \\nmay have a positive impact on outcomes. Other supportive \\nmeasures include controlling agitation, fever, and seizures.\\nThe treatment of hydrocephalus may be medical or surgical, \\ndepending on the etiology. After subarachnoid hemorrhage or \\nmeningitis, the flow or absorption of CSF may be transiently \\nimpaired. In this circumstance, the use of medication that \\ndecreases CSF production, such as acetazolamide, may be \\nbeneficial. Surgical management consists of removing the \\nobstructive lesion, placing a shunt, or both. A shunt consists \\nof polyethylene tubing extending usually from a lateral ventricle \\nto the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Shunts \\ncarry the hazards of infection or sudden occlusion with signs \\nand symptoms of acute hydrocephalus.\\nAll treatments for increased ICP are temporary measures \\nintended to prevent herniation until the underlying disease \\nprocess either is treated or resolves spontaneously. Timely \\nintervention can prevent or reverse cerebral herniation. \\nComplete neurological recovery is possible, but rare, after \\nsigns of transtentorial or foramen magnum herniation have \\nbegun. When these signs are complete, however, with bilaterally \\ndilated, unreactive pupils, absent eye movements, and flaccid \\nquadriplegia, recovery is no longer possible.\\nacetazolamide or other diuretic, topiramate, or corticosteroids, \\nis generally effective. Weight loss and cessation of triggering \\nmedications are also mainstays of treatment. Infrequently, \\nchronic papilledema from persistent idiopathic intracranial \\nhypertension produces visual impairment, and more aggressive \\nmanagement is required (optic nerve fenestration) to preserve \\nvisual function.\\nClinical Manifestations\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nStrabismus\\nVomiting\\nHeadaches\\nAltered Mental Status\\nThe symptoms and signs of increased ICP include headache, \\nvomiting, lethargy, irritability, altered consciousness, sixth nerve \\npalsy, strabismus, diplopia, and papilledema. Headaches sug-\\ngestive of increased ICP are those associated with nocturnal \\nwakening; worse in the morning; with cough, micturition, \\ndefecation, or Valsalva maneuver; or progressively worsening. \\nSpecific signs of increased ICP in the infratentorial compartment \\n(posterior fossa) include stiff neck and head tilt. Focal neurologi-\\ncal deficits reflect the site of the lesion that is producing the \\nincreased ICP and may include hemiparesis from supratentorial \\nlesions, or ataxia and cranial nerve palsies from infratentorial \\nlesions. Critically increased ICP may result in herniation \\nsyndromes, as discussed earlier. In addition, the Cushing triad \\nof elevated blood pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations \\nis a late sign of critically elevated ICP . Infants who have an \\nopen fontanelle may present with less specific symptoms such \\nas irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding. Specific signs of \\nincreased ICP in infants consist of a bulging fontanelle, suture \\ndiastasis, distended scalp veins, a persistent downward deviation \\nof the eyes (sunsetting), and rapid growth of head circumference. \\nManifestations of increased ICP may evolve slowly when there \\nis slow growth of a mass or incomplete obstruction allowing \\nfor transependymal absorption of CSF into the veins. On the \\nother hand, symptoms may develop rapidly in the setting of \\nacute intracranial hemorrhage or abrupt CSF obstruction.\\nLaboratory and Diagnostic Studies\\nThe cause of increased ICP is determined by brain imaging \\nwith either head CT or brain magnetic resonance imaging \\n(MRI). CT is rapid, readily available, and provides clear visualiza-\\ntion of an acute hemorrhage, dilated ventricles, or mass lesions. \\nDiffuse brain swelling produced by hypoxic-ischemic injury, \\nmeningitis, encephalitis, metabolic abnormalities, or toxins may \\nbe better delineated by MRI. MRI is also superior to CT for \\nvisualizing the posterior fossa and cortical contusions. In order \\nto avoid radiation from head CT, many centers now use limited \\nsequences to allow for a rapid MRI without sedation as an \\ninitial screen for acute causes of elevated ICP . LP is the diagnostic \\ntest for infection and for documentation of elevated ICP \\n(essential for patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension). \\nHowever, LP is contraindicated in the setting of an intracranial \\nmass lesion or clear hydrocephalus because withdrawal of CSF \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Symptoms include headache, vomiting \\nlethargy, decreased consciousness, and seizures. The classic \\npresentation of epidural hemorrhages involves a lucid interval: \\nfollowing the primary brain injury, a child has a decreased \\nlevel of consciousness, then returns to normal for several hours \\nbefore developing rapidly progressive neurological symptoms. \\nWhen associated with neurological decompensation, prompt \\nevacuation of the epidural hematoma is the primary therapy. \\nSubdural hemorrhages may result from direct trauma or \\nrotational forces from vigorous shaking (abusive head trauma). \\nTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY\\nFollowing head injury, children may have immediate depression \\nof consciousness and neurological deficits or may be completely \\nalert without any immediate signs of neurological injury. Most \\nserious trauma results from motor vehicle crashes, sports, \\nrecreation-related injuries, and violence. Head trauma may \\nresult in concussion, posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, \\nskull fractures, or cranial nerve or cervical spine injuries. Head \\ninjury, or other injuries, with associated retinal hemorrhages \\nin infants and young children should raise the suspicion of \\nabusive head trauma (see Chapter 22).\\nConcussion\\nConcussion is the process in which traumatic forces on the \\nbrain result in the rapid onset of short-lived neurological \\nimpairment that typically resolves spontaneously. In some cases, \\nhowever, symptoms and signs may evolve over minutes to hours, \\nso patients should not be left alone following the injury. Patients \\nmay have signs or symptoms in one or more domain: somatic \\n(headache), cognitive (slowed reaction times, poor attention), \\nemotional (lability, irritability), sleep disturbance (drowsiness), \\nor physical signs (loss of consciousness, amnesia). A player \\nwith any features of a concussion should be evaluated by a \\nlicensed health care provider onsite or be referred to a physician. \\nAcute symptoms usually reflect a functional disturbance rather \\nthan structural injury, and no abnormalities are seen on standard \\nimaging. If the child appears well after several hours and is \\ndischarged home, parents should be instructed to call their \\nphysician for any change in alertness, orientation, or neurological \\nfunctioning. An increase in somnolence, headache, or vomiting \\nis cause for concern and emergent neuroimaging. The majority \\nof concussions resolve within 10 days, although the recovery \\nmay be slower in children, and in a small percentage of cases, \\nthe symptoms are prolonged. Physical and cognitive rest are \\nthe cornerstones of concussion management. Children must \\nnot be permitted to resume physical activities until well after \\nthe symptoms resolve (Table 184.5). Repeated concussions, \\nespecially within a short time frame (days or weeks), carry a \\nsignificant risk of permanent brain injury (second impact \\nsyndrome).\\nTABLE 184.5 Protocol for Return to Sport After \\nConcussion\\nReturn to play protocol follows a stepwise progress with each \\nstep taking ≥24 hours.

The prognosis is excellent and likeli-\\nhood of later epilepsy is negligible. Early posttraumatic seizures \\noccurring within the first week of the head injury are likely the \\nresult of a localized area of cerebral contusion or edema. The \\nlong-term prognosis for these seizures is quite favorable. Late \\nposttraumatic seizures arise more than a week after the trauma \\nand most likely indicate an area of cortical gliosis or scarring \\nthat will be a source for long-term epilepsy. These patients \\noften require long-term antiepileptic drug therapy.\\nTransient neurological disturbances  may develop a few \\nminutes after head trauma and last for minutes to hours before \\nclearing. The most common symptoms are cortical blindness \\nand confusional states, but hemiparesis, ataxia, or any other \\nneurological deficit may appear. These symptoms may represent \\na trauma-triggered migraine in susceptible children. Care must \\nbe exercised to exclude intracranial pathology.\\nDrowsiness, headache, and vomiting are common after head \\ntrauma. They are not, by themselves, of concern if consciousness \\nis preserved, the clinical trend is one of improvement, and \\nresults of the neurological examination are normal. Children \\nare especially susceptible to somnolence after head trauma but \\nshould be easily arousable. If symptoms worsen or persist for \\nmore than 1-2 days, neuroimaging may be indicated to evaluate \\nfor intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema.\\nEvaluation and Treatment\\nChildren who have loss of consciousness or amnesia following \\na head injury should be evaluated in an emergency department. \\nHigh-risk patients include those with persistent depressed or \\ndecreasing level of consciousness, focal neurological signs, \\npenetrating skull injury, depressed skull fractures, or worsening \\nsymptoms. Because patients with intracranial hemorrhage may \\nprogressively deteriorate and require immediate neurosurgical \\ncare, these patients warrant care in a skilled trauma center.\\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale is a valuable tool for monitoring \\nthe course of patients’ after trauma for signs of deterioration \\n(see Chapter 42). Management includes ensuring an appropriate \\nairway, breathing, and circulation. Neuroimaging with CT or \\nMRI, and skull and cervical spine radiographs are obtained \\nemergently. Neuroimaging is not necessary for uncomplicated \\nconcussions but should be employed whenever suspicion of \\nstructural intracranial lesion exists.\\nThe observation period varies with the severity of the injury \\nand may include hospitalization. Patients with intracranial \\nhemorrhage may require emergent surgical intervention for \\ndecompression and drainage of the blood collection. Increased \\nICP may require monitoring, placement of a ventricular drain, \\nand aggressive medical management, including intubation and \\nventilation, osmotic therapy, and sedation. ICP may rise abruptly \\nafter fluid resuscitation for a child with both head injury and \\nsystemic injuries; such children must be monitored intensively \\nso that interventions to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure \\nare immediately available.\\nPrognosis\\nChildren with TBI without subsequent neurological deficits \\nhave a favorable long-term prognosis and late sequelae are rare. \\nChildren with moderate TBI usually make good recoveries \\neven when neurological signs persist for weeks. Long-term \\nsequelae may include poor memory, slowing of motor skills, \\ndecline in cognitive skills, behavioral alterations, or attention \\ndeficits. Language function, especially in a young child, \\nIn neonates and infants with open fontanelles, signs and \\nsymptoms may be absent or nonspecific. Subarachnoid hemor-\\nrhages classically present as a sudden, severe headache due to \\nrupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Brain contusions are areas \\nof bruising with associated localized ischemia, edema, and mass \\neffect.\\nSkull Fractures\\nSkull fractures may present with localized swelling and pain; \\nsubcutaneous bleeding over the mastoid process (Battle sign) \\nor around the orbit (raccoon eyes); blood behind the tympanic \\nmembrane (hemotympanum); or CSF leak from the nose \\n(rhinorrhea) or ear (otorrhea). Skull fractures may be linear, \\ndiastatic (spreading the suture), depressed (an edge displaced \\ninferiorly), or compound (bone fragments breaking the skin \\nsurface). Linear, diastatic, and minimally depressed fractures \\nnecessitate no specific treatment, but imaging is indicated to \\nevaluate for associated intracranial hemorrhages. If the depres-\\nsion is more than 0.5-1 cm, s urgical elevation of bone fragments \\nand repair of associated dural tears are generally recommended. \\nCompound fractures or penetrating injuries necessitate emergent \\nsurgical debridement and tetanus prophylaxis. The risk of \\nassociated brain contusion and early seizures is high in com-\\npound fractures.\\nRarely, a few weeks to months after linear skull fractures, \\na soft, pulsatile scalp mass is palpable; the fracture edges are \\nseparated by a soft tissue mass that consists of fibrotic tissue \\nand accumulated brain and meningeal tissue and, possibly, a \\nleptomeningeal cyst.\\nCSF leak occurs when a skull fracture tears adjacent dura, \\ncreating communications between the subarachnoid space and \\nthe nose, paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, or ear. Clear fluid \\nthat leaks from the nose or ear after head trauma is presumed \\nto be CSF until proved otherwise. The presence of air within \\nthe subdural, subarachnoid, or ventricular space also indicates \\na dural tear and open communication between the nose or \\nparanasal sinuses and brain. In most cases, the dura heals \\nspontaneously when the patient’s head is kept elevated. Patients \\nwith CSF leaks are at risk for the development of meningitis or \\nextradural abscesses. If the leak persists or recurs or if meningitis \\ndevelops, the dura is surgically repaired. Cranial nerve palsies, \\nsecondary to a laceration or contusion of the cranial nerves, may \\nresult from a skull fracture and may be transitory or permanent.\\nOther Complications of Head Trauma\\nCervical spine injuries must be suspected in any unconscious \\nchild, especially if bruises are present on the head, neck, or \\nback. In conscious children, findings of neck or back pain, \\nburning or stabbing pains radiating to the arms, paraplegia, \\nquadriplegia, or asymmetrical motor or sensory responses of \\narms or legs suggest spinal cord injury. Cervical spine injury \\n(displaced or fractured vertebra) may result in complete transec-\\ntion of the cord with spinal shock, loss of sensation, and flaccid \\nparalysis. A contused cord (without vertebral abnormality) may \\npresent in a similar manner. Any patient with a clinical or \\nradiological abnormality of the spine requires immediate spine \\nimmobilization, cardiopulmonary stabilization, and neurosurgi-\\ncal consultation.\\nPosttraumatic seizures are divided into one of three pat -\\nterns: impact seizures, early posttraumatic seizures, and late \\nposttraumatic seizures.

Rarely, children present \\nwith stagnation of development or frank loss of previously \\nacquired skills. The neurodegenerative disorders encompass \\na large heterogeneous group of diseases that result from \\nspecific genetic and biochemical defects and varied unknown \\ncauses. Neurodegenerative disorders can present at any age. \\nClinical phenotypes also vary, but neurological deterioration \\nmay be demonstrated as loss of speech, vision, hearing, and \\nintellectual or motor abilities—sometimes in concert with \\nseizures, feeding difficulties, and intellectual disability. Progres-\\nsion may be slow over many years or may lead to death in  \\nearly childhood.\\nHEREDITARY AND METABOLIC \\nDEGENERATIVE DISEASES\\nDegenerative diseases may affect gray matter (neuronal \\ndegenerative disorders), white matter (leukodystrophies), \\nboth gray and white matter, or specific, focal regions of the \\nbrain. Early seizures and intellectual impairment mark gray \\nmatter disorders, whereas upper motor neuron signs and \\nprogressive spasticity are the hallmarks of white matter disorders. \\nMany neurodegenerative illnesses result from enzymatic dis-\\norders within subcellular organelles, including lysosomes, \\nmitochondria, and peroxisomes (Table 185.1). Therefore any \\npatient with a degenerative neurological condition of unknown \\ncause should have leukocytes or skin fibroblasts harvested for \\nmeasurement of a standard battery of lysosomal, peroxisomal, \\nand mitochondrial enzymes (see Chapters 56 and 57). Neuro-\\nimaging, usually with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), \\nis also typically warranted. The diagnosis of leukodystrophy \\ncan usually be made confidently on the basis of extensive cerebral \\nwhite matter changes on MRI. Histological and biochemical \\nstudies may be normal in gray matter encephalopathy, making \\nthe diagnosis much less secure. Acquired lesions (infectious, \\ninflammatory, vascular, toxic) are difficult to exclude completely. \\nBrain biopsy is not likely to be helpful.\\nTABLE 185.1 Selected Clinical Features of \\nNeurodegenerative Disorders and Relevant \\nDiagnostic Tests\\nSPHINGOLIPIDOSES\\nNiemann-Pick Disease\\nCognitive\\tregression, \\thepatosplenomegaly, \\tjaundice, \\tseizures\\nTest: acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity\\nGaucher Disease\\nHepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, spasticity, hyperextension, \\nextraocular palsies, trismus, difficulty swallowing\\nTest: glucosylceramidase enzyme activity\\nGM1 Gangliosidoses\\nInfantile form—early feeding difficulties, global retardation, \\nseizures, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, cherry red \\nspot\\nJuvenile form—incoordination, weakness, language regression; \\nlater, seizures, spasticity, blindness\\nAdult form\\nTest: GM1 ganglioside enzyme activity; GLB1 gene testing\\nGM2 Gangliosidoses\\nTay-Sachs Disease—progressive weakness, marked startle \\nreaction, blindness, convulsions, spasticity, and cherry red spots\\nTest: β-hexosaminidase A enzymatic activity\\nSandhoff Disease—phenotype similar to Tay-Sachs\\nTest: β-hexosaminidase A and B enzyme activity (both  \\ndeficient)\\nKrabbe Disease/Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy\\nIrritability, hyperpyrexia, vomiting, seizures, hypertonia, blindness\\nTest: galactocerebrosidase enzyme activity\\nMetachromic Leukodystrophy\\nLate infantile form—stiffening and ataxia of gait, spasticity, optic \\natrophy, intellectual deterioration, absent reflexes\\nJuvenile and adult forms\\nTests: 1. arylsulfatase A (ARSA) enzyme activity\\n2.

Neurological symptoms characteristically \\nbegin in the early teenage years with dysarthria, dysphasia, \\ndrooling, fixed smile, tremor, dystonia, and emotional lability. \\nMRI shows abnormalities of the basal ganglia. Treatment is with \\na copper-chelating agent, such as oral penicillamine.\\nby progressive vision loss, seizures, declining cognitive abilities, \\nmotor deterioration, and early death. Ten different types have \\nbeen characterized, including infantile, late-infantile, and \\njuvenile types.\\nAdrenoleukodystrophy\\nThe adrenoleukodystrophies (ALDs) are a group of X-linked \\nneurodegenerative disorders that are often associated with \\nadrenocortical insufficiency. ALD is caused by accumulation \\nof very long chain fatty acids in neuronal and adrenal tissue \\n(see Chapter 178) and is diagnosed by abnormal very long \\nchain fatty acid testing. The most common leukodystrophy is \\nclassic X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, caused by a mutation \\nin the ABCD1 gene. Boys present between ages 5 and 15 years \\nwith academic difficulties, behavioral disturbances, and gait \\nabnormalities, progressing to seizures, spasticity, ataxia, and \\nswallowing difficulties. Brain MRI demonstrates a classic pattern \\nof symmetrical abnormal white matter signal in the parietal-\\noccipital regions, with contrast enhancement at the anterior \\nmargin. Symptomatic adrenocortical insufficiency with fatigue, \\nvomiting, and hypotension develops in 20-40% of patients with \\nX-linked ALD. ALD should be considered in any male with \\nprimary adrenocortical insufficiency, even in the absence of \\nclear-cut neurological abnormalities. Adrenomyeloneuropathy, \\na chronic disorder of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, \\npresents in the third decade of life. Female carriers of the ABCD1 \\nmutation may also have symptoms similar to adrenomyelo -\\nneuropathy, beginning later in life (>35 years of age).\\nMucopolysaccharidoses\\nMucopolysaccharidoses are caused by defective lysosomal \\nhydrolases resulting in the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides \\nwithin lysosomes (see Chapter 56). The clinical manifestations \\ninclude coarse facies, short stature, kyphoscoliosis, hepato-\\nsplenomegaly, cardiovascular abnormalities, and corneal \\nclouding. Neurological involvement is seen in mucopolysac-\\ncharidosis types I (Hurler syndrome), II (Hunter syndrome), \\nIII (Sanfilippo syndrome), and VII (Sly syndrome). Children \\nwith Hurler syndrome, the most severe of these illnesses, appear \\nnormal during the first 6 months of life, then develop the \\ncharacteristic skeletal and neurological features. Intellectual \\ndisability, spasticity, deafness, and optic atrophy are progressive. \\nHydrocephalus frequently occurs because of obstruction to \\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow by thickened leptomeninges.\\nMitochondrial Disorders\\nMitochondrial diseases  represent a clinically heterogeneous \\ngroup of disorders that fundamentally share a disturbance in \\noxidative phosphorylation (adenosine triphosphate synthesis; \\nsee Chapter 57). Abrupt symptoms are often manifest concurrent \\nwith periods of physiological stress such as febrile illness or \\nfasting. Specific genetic diagnoses are often difficult to identify \\nbecause several different gene mutations can cause the same \\ndisease, single mutations can have multiple phenotypes, and \\nanalysis of mitochondrial protein function is technically \\ndemanding. Specific syndromes include MELAS (mitochondrial \\nmyopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like \\nepisodes); MERRF (myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers), \\nwhich can also manifest as combinations of dementia, \\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nJaundice\\nHepatomegaly\\nInvoluntary Movements\\nHypocalcemia\\nSubacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, or Leigh disease, \\nis a neuropathologically defined, degenerative, inherited CNS \\ndisease primarily involving the periaqueductal region of the \\nbrainstem, caudate, and putamen.

People with TSC may have retinal lesions (retinal \\nhamartomas, white depigmented patches) and brain lesions \\n(cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, hydrocephalus). Tub ers \\nin the cerebral cortex are areas of dysplasia that, in combination \\nwith other microscopic areas of abnormal development, are \\nresponsible for the symptoms of intellectual disability and \\nepilepsy. TSC is one of the most common causes of infantile \\nspasms; in this context, the infantile spasms often respond to \\ntreatment with vigabatrin. Subependymal nodules  are ham-\\nartomas that may mutate into a growth phase and become \\nsubependymal giant cell astrocytomas  (SEGAs), causing \\nobstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow and resultant hydro-\\ncephalus. SEGAs can be treated with everolimus, a mammalian \\ntarget of rapamycin inhibitor, and preliminary studies suggest \\nthat this medication can also reduce seizure burden for people \\nwith TSC.\\nExtracerebral manifestations include typical skin findings of \\nhypomelanotic macules (ash leaf spots),  which are easiest to \\nvisualize under a Wood ultraviolet lamp and are apparent in \\ninfancy. Facial angiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum) appear as \\nsmall red nodules over the nose and cheeks that are sometimes \\nconfused with acne. Shagreen patches  are elevated, rough \\nplaques of skin with a predilection for the lumbar and gluteal \\nregions that develop in late childhood or early adolescence. \\nCardiac rhabdomyomas are largest during prenatal life and \\ninfancy and are rarely symptomatic. Occasionally, they may \\ncause arrhythmias or cardiac outflow obstruction. Renal angio-\\nmyolipomas may undergo malignant transformation and are the \\nmost common cause of death in adults with TSC. Interstitial \\npulmonary disease also affects adults with TSC (pulmonary \\nlymphangioleiomyomatosis).\\nSTURGE-WEBER SYNDROME\\nSturge-Weber syndrome is sporadic (not inherited) and is caused \\nby a somatic mosaic mutation of the GNAQ gene. It is character-\\nized by abnormal blood vessels (angiomas) of the leptomeninges \\noverlying the cerebral cortex in association with an ipsilateral \\nfacial port-wine stain involving the ophthalmic division of the \\ntrigeminal nerve (forehead and upper eyelid) and, often, \\nglaucoma. The port-wine stain, also known as nevus flammeus, \\nis due to an ectasia of superficial venules and may have a much \\nmore extensive and even bilateral distribution. Not all children \\nwith a facial port-wine stain have Sturge-Weber syndrome.\\nMRI with contrast demonstrates leptomeningeal angioma \\nand white matter abnormalities thought to be due to chronic \\nhypoxia and atrophy. Angiomas produce venous engorgement \\nand, presumably, stasis within the involved areas, which are \\nthought to result in hypoxia. Seizures are the most common \\nassociated neurological abnormality, occurring in 75% of \\npatients. Children may also present with hemiparesis, stroke-\\nlike episodes, headaches, developmental delay, and learning \\ndisabilities. Many children with Sturge-Weber syndrome are \\nintellectually normal, and seizures are well controlled with \\nstandard anticonvulsants. However, progressive ischemia of the \\nunderlying brain develops in some children with Sturge-Weber \\nsyndrome, resulting in hemiparesis, hemianopia, intractable \\nfocal seizures, and cognitive impairment. Hemispherectomy \\nhas been proposed for individuals with unilateral disease whose \\nseizures are difficult to control, both to control the epilepsy \\nand to preserve cognitive and motor development.

They rarely cause \\nany symptoms but can cause significant cosmetic concerns. \\nNeurofibromas may also be situated within viscera or along \\nblood vessels and peripheral nerves. Plexiform neurofibromas \\nare large, occasionally nodular, subcutaneous lesions that lie \\nalong the major peripheral nerve trunks. They often cause \\nsymptoms including pain, weakness, and invasion of adjacent \\nviscera, bone, or spinal cord. Sarcomatous degeneration may \\noccur. Surgical treatment may be attempted, but results are \\noften unsatisfactory.\\nCommon complications are learning disability, scoliosis, sei-\\nzures, and cerebral vasculature abnormalities. Other tumors that \\noccur in NF1 are optic nerve gliomas, astrocytomas of brain and \\nspinal cord, and malignant peripheral nerve tumors. T2-weighted \\nmagnetic resonance images (MRIs) reveal hyperintense lesions \\n(hamartomas) in the optic tracts, internal capsule, thalamus, \\ncerebellum, and brainstem that are common and distinctive \\nfor the disease. They are benign and disappear in adulthood.\\nThe average life expectancy of patients with NF1 may be \\nreduced by 10-15 years. Malignancy is the most common cause \\nof death. Genetic and psychological counseling are important \\ncomponents of care for this chronic disorder. Although it is an \\nautosomal-dominant disorder, spontaneous mutations account \\nfor 30-50% of cases.\\nNeurofibromatosis Type 2\\nNeurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal-dominant \\ndisorder with an incidence of 1 in 25,000. Half the cases have \\nno family history. The NF2 gene is a tumor suppressor gene \\nand disease results in neurological, eye, and skin lesions. NF2 \\npredisposes patients to multiple intracranial and spinal tumors, \\nincluding bilateral acoustic schwannomas, schwannomas of \\nother cranial and spinal nerves, meningiomas, and gliomas. \\nPosterior capsular or cortical cataracts are common, and skin \\nlesions include plaque-like lesions, subcutaneous nodules, and \\ncutaneous schwannomas. Lisch nodules, café-au-lait spots, and \\naxillary freckling (seen in NF1) are not features of NF2.\\nTUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX\\nEtiology\\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal-dominant \\ndisorder, is characterized by hamartomas in many organs, \\nespecially the brain, eyes, skin, kidneys, and heart. The incidence \\nis 1 in 10,000 births. Two thirds of cases are sporadic and \\nthought to represent new mutations. Germline mosaicism is \\nuncommon but explains how parents who apparently do not \\nhave the disease can have multiple children with tuberous \\nsclerosis. Mutations affecting either of the presumed tumor \\nsuppressor genes, TSC1 or TSC2, cause tuberous sclerosis. The \\nTSC1 and TSC2 genes encode distinct proteins, hamartin and \\ntuberin, which are widely expressed in the brain and result in \\nconstitutive activation of the protein kinase mTOR (mammalian \\ntarget of rapamycin), leading to the formation of numerous \\nbenign tumors (hamartomas).\\nClinical Manifestations\\nTSC is an extremely heterogeneous disease with variable \\nexpression and a wide clinical spectrum varying from normal \\nintelligence without seizures to severe intellectual disability \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Patients may also have an associated \\ndermoid sinus, an epithelial tract extending from the skin \\nsurface to the meninges; this increases the risk of meningitis. \\nPatients with spina bifida occulta or meningocele may have \\nweakness and numbness in the feet that can result in recurrent \\nulcerations, or difficulties controlling bowel or bladder function \\nthat may result in recurrent urinary tract infections, reflux \\nnephropathy, and renal insufficiency. In diastematomyelia, a \\nbone spicule or fibrous band divides the spinal cord into two \\nlongitudinal sections. An associated lipoma that infiltrates the \\ncord and tethers it to the vertebrae may be present. Symp -\\ntoms include weakness and numbness of the feet and urinary  \\nincontinence.\\nDiagnostic Studies\\nMyelomeningocele in the fetus is suggested by an elevated \\nalpha-fetoprotein in the mother’s blood and confirmed by \\nultrasound and high concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein and \\nacetylcholinesterase in the amniotic fluid. After birth, screening \\nultrasound may be used with magnetic resonance imaging to \\nconfirm less dramatic underlying spinal abnormalities.\\nTreatment and Prevention\\nNeonates with myelomeningocele must undergo operative \\nclosure of the open spinal defects (fetal or postnatal surgery) \\nand often require treatment of hydrocephalus by placement of \\na ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Compared to postnatal surgery, \\nfetal surgery prior to 26 weeks’ gestation to close the myelo -\\nmeningocele reduces the need for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \\nshunting and improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. Toddlers \\nand children with lower spinal cord dysfunction require physical \\ntherapy, bracing of the lower extremities, and intermittent \\nbladder catheterization. In the absence of associated brain \\nanomalies, most survivors have normal intelligence, but learning \\nproblems and epilepsy are more common than in the general \\npopulation.\\nSpina bifida can be prevented in many cases by folate \\nadministration to the pregnant mother. Because the defect \\noccurs so early in gestation, all women of childbearing age \\nare advised to take oral folic acid daily.\\nCONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF  \\nTHE BRAIN\\nDefective closure of the rostral neural tube produces anencephaly \\nor encephaloceles. Neonates with anencephaly have a rudi -\\nmentary brainstem or midbrain, but no cortex or cranium. \\nThis is rapidly fatal after delivery. Patients with encephalocele \\nusually have a skull defect and exposure of meninges alone or \\nmeninges and brain. The recurrence risk in subsequent pregnan-\\ncies for either cranial or spinal neural tube defects is 3-4%. \\nWithin a family, an anencephalic birth may be followed by the \\nbirth of a child affected with a lumbosacral myelomeningocele. \\nThe inheritance of neural tube defects is polygenic.\\nAgenesis of the corpus callosum may be partial or complete \\nand may occur in an isolated fashion or in association with \\nother anomalies of cellular migration. Dandy-Walker malforma-\\ntion is diagnosed on the basis of the classic triad: complete or \\npartial agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, cystic dilation of the \\nfourth ventricle, and enlarged posterior fossa.

The neural tube begins to form on day 22 of gestation. \\nThe rostral end forms the brain, and the caudal region forms the \\nspinal cord. The lumen of the neural tube forms the ventricles \\nof the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. Most brain \\nmalformations are produced by a variety of injuries occurring \\nduring a vulnerable period of gestation. Precipitating factors \\ninclude chromosomal, genetic, and metabolic abnormalities; \\ninfections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes); \\nand exposure to irradiation, certain drugs, and maternal illness \\nduring pregnancy.\\nCONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE  \\nSPINAL CORD\\nEtiology and Clinical Manifestations\\nDefective closure of the caudal neural tube at the end of week \\n4 of gestation results in anomalies of the lumbar and sacral \\nvertebrae or spinal cord called spina bifida. These anomalies \\nrange in severity from clinically insignificant defects of the L5 or \\nS1 vertebral arches to major malformations, leaving the spinal \\ncord uncovered by skin or bone on the infant’s back. The latter \\nsevere defect, called a myelomeningocele, results in flaccid \\nparalysis and loss of sensation in the legs and incontinence of \\nbowel and bladder, with the extent and degree of neurological \\ndeficit dependent on the location of the myelomeningocele. In \\naddition, affected children usually have an associated Chiari \\ntype II malformation (downward displacement of the cerebellar \\ntonsils and medulla), resulting in hydrocephalus and weakness \\nof face and swallowing. In a meningocele, the spinal canal and \\ncystic meninges are exposed on the back, but the underlying \\nspinal cord is anatomically and functionally intact. In spina \\nbifida occulta,  the skin of the back is apparently intact, but \\ndefects of the underlying bone or spinal canal are present. \\nMeningoceles and spina bifida occulta may be associated \\nwith a lipoma, dermoid cyst, or tethering of the cord to a \\nthick filum terminale. A dimple or tuft of hair may be present \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Unilateral clefts can cause isolated congenital \\nhemiparesis, whereas bilateral schizencephaly causes spastic \\nquadriparesis and associated intellectual disability. Affected \\nindividuals are at high risk for focal epilepsy.\\nA severe defect in cortical migration, lissencephaly results \\nin a smooth brain without sulcation (agyria). The normal \\nsix-layered cortex does not develop. Affected children have \\ndifficult-to-control seizures and profound developmental \\nretardation. This anomaly most commonly is part of a genetic \\ndisorder, which may be x-linked (DCX mutations) or caused by \\nde novo autosomal-dominant gene mutations (Lis-1 mutations). \\nIn pachygyria, the gyri are few in number and too broad. In \\npolymicrogyria, the gyri are too many and too small. Sometimes \\npachygyria and polymicrogyria affect an entire hemisphere, \\nproducing enlargement of that hemisphere and a clinical \\nsyndrome of severe, medically intractable seizures that begin \\nin early infancy. Gray matter heterotopias are abnormal islands \\nwithin the central white matter of neurons that have never \\ncompleted the migratory process.\\nassociated hydrocephalus, absence of the corpus callosum, and \\nneuronal migration abnormalities. Intelligence may be normal \\nor impaired, depending on the degree of associated cerebral \\ndysgenesis.\\nHoloprosencephaly represents varying degrees of failure \\nof the forebrain (prosencephalon) to divide into two distinct \\ncerebral hemispheres. Holoprosencephaly is often associ-\\nated with midline facial defects (hypotelorism, cleft lip, cleft  \\npalate). This anomaly may be isolated or associated with a \\nchromosomal or genetic disorder. The prognosis for infants \\nwith severe (alobar) holoprosencephaly is uniformly poor, but \\nthose with milder forms (semilobar, lobar) may have less severe \\nneurological outcomes. Children with trisomy 13 and trisomy \\n18 characteristically have varying degrees of holoprosencephaly.\\nHydranencephaly is a condition in which the brain presum-\\nably develops normally, but then is destroyed by an intrauterine, \\nprobably vascular, insult. The result is virtual absence of the \\ncerebrum with an intact skull. The thalamus, brainstem, and \\nsome occipital cortex are typically present. Children may have \\na normal external appearance at the time of birth, but do not \\nachieve developmental milestones.\\nMacrocephaly and Microcephaly\\nMacrocephaly represents a head circumference above the 97th \\npercentile and may be the result of macrocrania (increased \\nskull thickness), hydrocephalus (enlargement of the ventricles; \\nsee Chapter 184), or megalencephaly (enlargement of the brain). \\nDiseases of bone metabolism or hypertrophy of the bone marrow \\ncauses macrocrania. Megalencephaly may be the result of a \\nsignificant disorder of brain development or an accumulation \\nof abnormal metabolic substances (Table 187.1). Most often, \\nhowever, macrocephaly is a familial trait of no clinical signifi-\\ncance. If the child is developmentally normal but has macro -\\ncephaly, plotting the parents’ head circumference on a growth \\nchart can provide reassurance and help to avoid unnecessary \\nneurodiagnostic testing.\\nMicrocephaly represents a head circumference below \\nthe 3rd percentile. A myriad of syndromes and metabolic \\ndisorders are associated with microcephaly, some of which \\nare hereditary (Table 187.2). In most instances, a small head \\ncircumference is a reflection of a small brain. Brain growth is \\nrapid during the perinatal period, and any insult (infectious, \\nmetabolic, toxic, vascular) sustained during this period or during \\nearly infancy is likely to impair brain growth and result in \\nmicrocephaly. Rarely, a small head is the result of premature \\nclosure of one or more skull sutures, called craniosynostosis. \\nThis diagnosis is readily made by the abnormal shape of \\nthe skull. As a rule, macrocephaly and microcephaly raise a \\nconcern about cognitive ability, but head circumference alone \\nshould never be used to establish a prognosis for intellectual  \\ndevelopment.\\nDisorders of Neuronal Migration\\nMany malformations result from the failure of normal migration \\nof neurons from the periventricular germinal matrix zone to \\nthe cortical surface at 1-5 months of gestation. Multiple mal-\\nformations may exist in the same patient. Neurological develop-\\nment with these anomalies varies and depends on the type and \\nextent of the malformation. Many children with disorders of \\nneuronal migration have treatment-resistant epilepsy.\\nTABLE 187.1 Causes of Macrocephaly\\nMacrocrania (increased skull thickness)\\nAchondroplasia\\nHypochondroplasia\\nFragile X syndrome\\nOsteopetrosis\\nChronic, severe anemia\\nHydrocephalus (enlargement of the ventricles; see Chapter 184)\\nMasses\\nCysts\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nSubdural fluid collections/hematoma\\nNeoplasm\\nMegalencephaly (enlargement of the brain)\\nEmbryological disorder causing abnormal proliferation of brain \\ntissue\\n•\\t Neurofibromatosis\\n•\\t Tuberous\\tsclerosis\\n•\\t Sturge-Weber\\tsyndrome\\n•\\t Sotos\\tsyndrome\\n•\\t Riley-Smith\\tsyndrome\\n•\\t Hemi-megalencephaly\\nAccumulation of abnormal metabolic substances\\n•\\t Alexander\\tdisease\\n•\\t Canavan\\tdisease\\n•\\t Gangliosidoses\\n•\\t Mucopolysaccharidoses\\nBenign causes\\nBenign extracerebral collections of infancy\\nFamilial macrocephaly\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Chiu\\nCHAPTER 188 \\nDermatology Assessment\\nApproximately one in three Americans of any age has at least \\none recognizable skin disorder at any time. The most common \\ncutaneous diseases encountered in community settings are \\ndermatophytosis, acne vulgaris, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic \\ndermatitis (eczema), verrucae (warts), tumors, psoriasis, vitiligo, \\nand infections such as herpes simplex and impetigo. The most \\ncommon diagnoses in children attending pediatric dermatology \\nclinics include atopic dermatitis, impetigo, tinea capitis, acne \\nvulgaris, verrucae vulgaris, and seborrheic dermatitis.\\nHISTORY\\nThe age of the patient, onset, duration, progression, associated \\ncutaneous symptoms (pain, pruritus), previous treatments, and \\nassociated systemic signs or symptoms (fever, malaise, weight \\nloss) are important clues. Obtaining an accurate description \\nof the original lesion improves diagnostic accuracy. Patients \\noften do not consider a topical antibiotic or antiitch medica-\\ntion as treatment. As over-the-counter remedies may alter \\nthe appearance of a rash, it is important to probe deeply with \\nrelated questions in the history. Other important information \\nincludes a history of allergies, environmental exposure, travel \\nhistory, previous treatment, affected contacts, and family  \\nhistory.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nA careful examination of the skin requires a visual and a tactile \\nassessment. Examination of the skin over the entire body must \\nbe performed systematically. Mucous membranes, hair, nails, \\nand teeth, all of ectodermal origin, also may be involved in \\ncutaneous disorders and should be assessed.\\nCOMMON MANIFESTATIONS\\nA descriptive nomenclature of skin lesions helps with generating \\na differential diagnosis and with communication between health \\ncare providers. Determination of the primary lesion and second-\\nary change is the cornerstone of dermatological diagnosis.

Primary lesions are often not seen on a patient \\nat the time of presentation, as most lesions are altered by time \\nor external factors such as medication applied, secondary \\ninfection, or physical manipulation (e.g., scratching). A search \\nfor the primary lesion often proves worthwhile and focuses \\nthe differential diagnosis to a category of lesion that is specific \\nfor the underlying diagnosis. On occasion, two different types \\nof primary lesions may be present. In most cases, secondary \\nlesions are the result of the effects of the primary lesion (Table \\n188.2).

A skin biopsy may \\nbe performed to help with the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen \\ncan be accomplished by either shave or punch biopsy. Both are \\nsimple in-office procedures. Occasionally, laboratory or imaging \\nstudies are necessary.\\nCHAPTER 189 \\nAcne\\nETIOLOGY\\nAcne vulgaris  (or acne) is a chronic inflammatory disorder \\nthat affects areas with the greatest concentration of sebaceous \\nglands, such as the face, chest, and back. The pathogenesis of \\nacne is multifactorial. Gender, age, genetic factors, and environ-\\nment are all major contributing factors. Stress may trigger acne, \\npossibly by affecting hormone levels. A high glycemic diet and \\nmilk intake may be associated with acne, although remain \\ncontroversial as potential causes.\\nAcne is caused by chronic inflammation of the pilosebaceous \\nunit (hair follicle with an associated sebaceous gland). The \\nprimary event in all acne lesions is the development of the \\nmicrocomedo, which results from the obstruction of the \\nhair follicle with keratin, increased sebum production from \\nsebaceous glands, and overgrowth of normal skin flora, leading \\nto pilosebaceous occlusion and enlargement. Androgens are \\na potent stimulus of the sebaceous gland. The subsequent \\ninflammatory component and pustule formation results from \\nproliferation of Propionibacterium acnes (P . acnes), a commensal \\norganism of the skin. The pathogenesis of acne thus involves \\nthree components: increased sebum production, hyperkeratosis, \\nand bacterial proliferation. Effective treatment focuses on \\nminimizing these factors.\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAcne is the most common skin disorder in adolescents, occurring \\nin 85% of teenagers. The incidence is similar in both sexes, \\nalthough boys often are more severely affected. Acne may begin \\nas early as 8 years of age and may continue into adulthood.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAcne primarily affects areas with increased sebaceous gland \\ndensity, such as the face, upper chest, and back. Superficial \\nplugging of the pilosebaceous unit results in noninflammatory \\nsmall (1- to 2-mm) open (blackhead) and closed (whitehead) \\ncomedones. An open comedo is less likely to become inflam-\\nmatory than a closed comedo. Rupture of a comedo into adjacent \\ndermis and proliferation of P . acnes induce an inflammatory \\nresponse and development of inflammatory papules and \\npustules. Larger, skin-colored or red cysts and nodules represent \\ndeeper plugging and cystic acne . Increased and persistent \\ninflammation, especially with rupture of a deep cyst, increases \\nthe risk of scarring.\\nThe diagnosis of acne is usually not difficult because of the \\ncharacteristic and chronic lesions. Laboratory studies and imaging \\nstudies are usually not necessary to diagnose acne. Screening \\ntests may be necessary if there are signs of hyperandrogenism \\ndue to polycystic ovarian syndrome (irregular menses, hirsutism, \\ninsulin resistance) or an underlying androgen-secreting tumor \\n(irregular menses, hirsutism, deepening voice, clitoromegaly).\\nTREATMENT\\nThe mainstays of treatment of acne are topical comedolytic \\nagents and topical antibiotics. Creams, lotions, gels, foams, and \\nsolutions are available. Gels and solutions are commonly used \\nbecause acne skin is generally greasier and these agents tend \\nto be drying. They also have the tendency to be irritating and \\nmay not be as well tolerated. Creams and lotions are better \\ntolerated but may not be as effective.\\nThe comedolytic agents (salicylic acid, azelaic acid, tretinoin, \\nadapalene, tazarotene) produce superficial desquamation and, \\nsubsequently, relieve follicular obstruction. They are a mainstay \\nof first-line therapy. The topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene, \\ntazarotene) are based on the vitamin A molecule. They decrease \\nkeratin and sebum production and have some antiinflammatory \\nand antibacterial activity; thus they can be the most effective \\nwhen used as monotherapy.\\nTopical antimicrobials (benzoyl peroxide, dapsone) and \\ntopical antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin) are anti-\\ninflammatory and inhibit P . acnes proliferation. Erythromycin \\nefficacy has decreased as P . acnes has become increasingly \\nresistant to this antibiotic and should no longer be used. Topical \\nantibiotics should be combined with an antimicrobial, such as \\nbenzoyl peroxide, to prevent the development of resistance. \\nCombination therapy of a topical comedolytic agent and a \\ntopical antimicrobial is more effective than either agent alone for  \\ninflammatory acne.\\nOral antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) \\nare typically used for deeper cystic lesions but should always \\nbe used in combination with a topical regimen. Tetracyclines \\nare the most effective antibiotics because of their significant \\nantiinflammatory activity. Tetracyclines should not be used in \\nchildren 8 years of age and younger. As with topical erythro -\\nmycin, oral erythromycin is no longer used because of bacterial \\nresistance. Given their increased risk of bacterial resistance and \\nreported associations with inflammatory bowel disease, Candida, \\nand Clostridium difficile infections, judicious use of systemic \\nantibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris is emphasized for \\nthose who treat acne.\\nFor recalcitrant or severe nodulocystic acne, oral isotretinoin \\nmay be instituted. Isotretinoin, an oral analog of vitamin A, \\nnormalizes follicular keratinization, reduces sebum production, \\nand decreases 5α-dihydrotestosterone formation and androgen \\nreceptor-binding capacity. A course of isotretinoin (0.5-1 mg/\\nkg/day to reach a cumulative dose of 120-150 mg/kg) is the \\nonly medication that can permanently alter the course of acne \\nand induce a durable remission. Because of the high incidence \\nof adverse effects, it should be used only by physicians familiar \\nwith this medication. Isotretinoin therapy requires careful patient \\nselection, pretreatment counseling, and laboratory monitoring. \\nIt is teratogenic and must not be used immediately before or \\nduring pregnancy.\\nFor females, hormonal agents can also be considered for anti-\\nacne therapy. These include the estrogen-containing combined \\noral contraceptives (although use should be limited to those \\nwithout contraindications) and spironolactone.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Only \\n1-2% of adults manifest disease. In addition to genetic factors, \\nan environmental influence contributes. Atopic dermatitis occurs \\nmore frequently in urban areas and in higher socioeconomic \\nclasses. Prevalence is lower in areas where industrial pollution \\nis less and where eosinophil-mediated infections such as hel-\\nminthic infections are endemic.\\nPatients generally have a family history of atopy. Children \\nwith atopic dermatitis are predisposed to the development of \\nallergy and allergic rhinitis, referred to as the atopic march. \\nAsthma develops in up to half of children with atopic dermatitis, \\nand allergic rhinitis develops even more frequently. Food aller-\\ngies are commonly present in children with atopic dermatitis \\nbut are a rare cause of atopic dermatitis itself.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disease character-\\nized by xerosis, pruritus, and characteristic skin findings. The \\ncondition generally improves with age and remits in adulthood, \\nalthough some childhood cases will continue into adulthood.\\nCharacteristic lesions of atopic dermatitis are erythematous \\npapules or plaques with ill-defined borders and overlying scale or \\nhyperkeratosis. Weeping may be present in acute stages, which \\nthen develops into yellow crust. Lesions can be secondarily \\nexcoriated and result in hemorrhagic crusting and lichenification \\nin older lesions. Formation of fissures is common in both acute \\nand chronic lesions. Temporary hypo- and hyperpigmentation \\ncan be seen after lesions resolve, but atopic dermatitis is not \\nusually scarring unless secondary features become severe (e.g., \\ninfection or scratching).\\nCharacteristic locations vary with the age of the patient. \\nInfantile atopic dermatitis typically affects the face and extensor \\nsurfaces of the extremities and is often generalized. Childhood \\nlesions predominate in flexural surfaces (antecubital and pop-\\nliteal fossae), wrists, ankles, hands, and feet (Fig. 190.1). The \\nadult phase occurs after puberty and manifests in the flexural \\nareas, including the neck, as well as predominant involvement \\non the face, hands, fingers, toes, and the upper arms and back.\\nSecondary bacterial infection, most commonly with Staphy-\\nlococcus aureus or less commonly with Streptococcus pyogenes, \\nis frequently present. Patients are at increased risk for infections \\nwith cutaneous viruses and can develop disseminated skin infec-\\ntions with viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV; eczema \\nherpeticum), varicella-zoster virus, coxsackievirus (eczema \\ncoxsackium), smallpox virus (eczema vaccinatum), and mol-\\nluscum contagiosum. Atopic skin is more susceptible to fungal \\ninfections as well. Signs of concomitant infection include acute \\nworsening of disease in an otherwise well-controlled patient, \\nresistance to standard therapy, fever, and presence of pustules, \\nfissures, punched out erosions, or exudative or crusted lesions \\n(Fig. 190.2). Eczema herpeticum and eczema vaccinatum can \\nbe life threatening if not treated.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nDiagnosis of atopic dermatitis is based on clinical signs and \\nsymptoms. Skin biopsy findings are generally characteristic \\nbut not exclusively diagnostic and can overlap with other skin \\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nAcne has significant and frequently devastating effects on an \\nadolescent’s body image and self-esteem. There may be little \\ncorrelation between severity and psychosocial impact. Scarring \\nmay result in permanent morbidity.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nClassically, acne lasts 3-5 years, although some individuals may \\nhave disease for 15-20 years. Only early treatment with isotreti-\\nnoin may alter the natural course of acne. Acne lesions often \\nheal with temporary postinflammatory erythema and hyper-\\npigmentation. Depending on the severity, chronicity, and depth \\nof involvement, pitted, atrophic, or hypertrophic scars may \\ndevelop. Cystic acne has the highest incidence of scarring \\nbecause rupture of a deep cyst induces the greatest inflammation, \\nalthough scarring may be caused by milder pustular or even \\ncomedonal acne.\\nPREVENTION\\nGreasy hair and cosmetic preparations should be avoided because \\nthey exacerbate preexisting acne. There are no effective means \\nfor preventing acne, although a low milk or low glycemic diet \\nmay improve acne. Repetitive cleansing with soap and water \\nor use of astringents or abrasives removes only surface lipids; \\ntheir use makes the skin appear less oily but does not prevent \\nformation of microcomedones and may paradoxically worsen \\nacne.\\nCHAPTER 190 \\nAtopic Dermatitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nAtopic dermatitis  is a chronic inflammatory disease with \\nno known cure. It is associated with significant psychoso -\\ncial morbidity and decreased health-related quality of life. \\nFor many affected individuals, atopic dermatitis is the skin \\nmanifestation of atopy accompanied by asthma and allergic  \\nrhinitis.\\nAtopic dermatitis manifests with a defective skin barrier, \\nreduced innate immune responses, and exaggerated immune \\nresponses to allergens and microbes. Both genetic predisposition \\nand environmental factors play a role in the development of \\natopic dermatitis. Genes associated with skin barrier dysfunction \\nand inflammation have been linked with atopic dermatitis. \\nInflammatory mediators involved include predominantly T \\nhelper (TH) cells, with the T H2 pathway implicated early in \\nacute lesions and a TH1 predominance found in chronic lesions. \\nLangerhans cells, immunoglobulin (Ig)E, and eosinophils \\nplay a prominent role, as well as many other inflammatory \\nmediators. Environmental and contact allergens, infec-\\ntions, irritants, extremes of temperature, sweat, and lack of \\nhumidity can exacerbate the condition, as can scratching or \\nrubbing. Triggers are somewhat variable from individual to  \\nindividual.\\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

The distribution of seborrheic dermatitis \\nis different from that of atopic dermatitis, typically involving \\nthe scalp, eyebrows, perinasal region, upper chest, and back. \\nThe two conditions occasionally coexist.\\nPsoriasis tends to localize on the elbows, knees, lower back, \\nand scalp. The lesions of psoriasis on exposed surfaces are \\nsalmon color at the base with an overlying hyperkeratosis that \\nis much thicker with silver coloration. They are generally very \\nwell demarcated, oval or round, thick plaques.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis has a distribution limited to one \\narea of the body corresponding to contact with the allergen. \\nThe lesions generally make well-demarcated, bizarre, linear, \\nsquare, or angulated shapes corresponding to the source. Nickel \\ndermatitis is common and results from contact sensitization \\nto nickel in metals. It occurs in characteristic locations, such \\nas the periumbilical area (where metal from pant buttons rub \\nagainst skin); on the ear lobule or neck (where earrings contact \\nskin); circumferentially around the neck (necklaces); and under \\nrings or wristbands. Patients with atopic dermatitis can have \\nconcomitant contact dermatitis as well.\\nTREATMENT\\nIdeal therapy for atopic dermatitis includes three main com -\\nponents: frequent liberal use of bland moisturizers to restore \\nthe skin barrier, avoidance of triggers of inflammation, and \\nuse of topical antiinflammatory medication to affected areas \\nof skin when needed. Control of pruritus and infection should \\nbe considered on an individual basis. If topical therapy and \\nthese measures are inadequate, systemic therapy with immu-\\nnosuppressive agents or ultraviolet light therapy may be \\nindicated.\\nA daily short bath with warm but not hot water is generally \\nrecommended, although this is controversial and there are some \\nwho advocate less frequent bathing. A moisturizing cream or \\nointment should be applied to the entire body immediately \\nafterward to trap moisture. Application of topical medications \\nis also most effective immediately after bathing. Additional \\ninformation for patients and families can be found at the website \\nof the National Eczema Association for Science and Education \\n(http://www.nationaleczema.org).\\nCommon triggers of inflammation in atopic dermatitis \\ninclude rubbing or scratching, contact with saliva or acidic foods, \\nsoaps and detergents, wool or other harsh materials, fragranced \\nproducts, sweat, highly chlorinated pools, low humidity, tobacco \\nsmoke, dust mites, animal dander, environmental pollens, and \\nmolds. Exposure to these triggers should be limited whenever \\npossible. Infections that are unrelated to skin disease, such \\nas an upper respiratory infection, can also exacerbate atopic \\ndermatitis. Food allergy is commonly seen in patients with atopic \\ndermatitis but typically presents with urticaria or anaphylaxis \\nrather than exacerbation of the atopic dermatitis.\\nTopical corticosteroids are the mainstay of antiinflammatory \\ntherapy for atopic dermatitis. Hundreds of topical corticosteroids \\nare available and are classified according to strength from I to \\nVII. Class I is the highest potency and class VII is the lowest \\npotency. Potency varies according to the steroid molecule \\n(active ingredient), and, for a given ingredient, strength can \\nvary according to relative concentration and vehicle base. \\nEnhanced penetration occurs in areas of natural occlusion \\n(flexures such as axillae and groin), with external occlusion \\n(diapers or bandages), in areas of open skin (excoriations), \\nconditions. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels \\ncan be found but are not specific and not routinely obtained. \\nSkin prick testing or measurement of specific IgE antibody \\nlevels can detect sensitization to food and environmental \\nallergens, although false-positive findings occur.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is extensive, but \\nthe history of a relapsing pruritic condition in the setting of \\natopy and skin lesions in a characteristic distribution is typical.\\nThe lesions of seborrheic dermatitis have circumscribed \\nand well-defined borders.

Class I and II steroids are typically avoided in young \\nchildren or in areas of thinner skin or enhanced penetration.\\nCorticosteroids are available in different vehicles. In general, \\nointments are preferred because of their increased efficacy, \\nocclusive nature, and tolerability. Creams may be slightly \\nless effective for a given steroid ingredient, but may be more \\ncosmetically acceptable for older patients or in warmer climates. \\nLotions may cause more irritation and are generally less potent. \\nSprays, foams, solutions, and gels can be especially useful for \\nhair-bearing areas. Creams, lotions, sprays, solutions, and gels \\ncan be particularly irritating when applied to atopic skin and \\nshould generally be avoided on areas of open skin.\\nTopical corticosteroids should be used in conjunction with \\nadequate skin care, such as avoiding triggers of inflammation \\nand frequent application of moisturizers. Twice-daily application \\nof corticosteroids is recommended. The goal is to limit the need \\nfor antiinflammatory medications and thereby avoid potential \\nfor adverse effects. Local side effects such as skin atrophy, striae, \\nacne, and hypopigmentation are related to corticosteroid potency, \\nsite of application, and duration of application. Systemic side \\neffects of adrenal suppression or Cushing syndrome can result \\nwith application of a potent topical corticosteroid to large surface \\nareas or occluded areas at risk of enhanced penetration.\\nTopical calcineurin inhibitors (also referred to as topical \\nimmune modulators) such as topical tacrolimus and pimecroli-\\nmus may be part of the treatment regimen for atopic dermatitis. \\nThese agents selectively inhibit T-cell proliferation by inhibiting \\ncalcineurin and subsequent interleukin 2 production. There is \\nno potential for skin atrophy; thus these agents are particularly \\nuseful for face or genital lesions. They are currently approved \\nfor intermittent therapy as second-line treatments for mild to \\nmoderate atopic dermatitis. Long-term studies, combined with \\nother modalities for treatment, are underway.\\nSedating antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) \\nhave only mild effect on pruritus but can improve the sleepless-\\nness due to scratching during the night. A dose before bedtime \\nis most effective. Additional daytime doses can be added on an \\nindividual basis when needed.

Rebound flare of atopic dermatitis is common following \\nwithdrawal of corticosteroids and should be anticipated to avoid \\nmisinterpretation of the natural disease severity. Long-term \\nand frequent repeated courses should be avoided to prevent \\nadverse effects.\\nUltraviolet light therapy (UVB, narrow band UVB, UV A, or \\nUV A1) can be an option for moderate to severe cases in older \\nchildren. Typically light therapy is administered two to three \\ntimes weekly until improvement is seen and then is tapered or \\ndiscontinued once the acute flare has resolved. More frequent \\nuse of light therapy in children is hindered by requirements for \\nfrequent office visits, ability to cooperate with standing in a light \\nbox while wearing protective goggles, and risk of long-term skin \\ndamage, including the potential for skin cancer development \\nwith excessive UV light exposure.

Group A \\nstreptococcus infection is also common. Infection manifests with \\npustules, erythema, crusting, flare of disease, or lack of response \\nto adequate antiinflammatory therapy. Localized lesions can be \\ntreated with topical mupirocin. Widespread and generalized \\nlesions require oral antibiotic therapy, most commonly with a \\nfirst-generation cephalosporin such as cephalexin. Methicillin-\\nresistant S. aureus infection is increasingly common, and \\nantibiotic therapy should be tailored based on local resistance \\nrates and patient factors. Diagnosis of superinfection may be \\nmade clinically, but a superficial bacterial culture can confirm the \\ndiagnosis and provide antimicrobial susceptibilities. Treatment \\nshould include a concomitant atopic skin care routine including \\nthe continued use of topical corticosteroids. Although secondary \\nskin infection with S. aureus is common, progression to cellulitis \\nor septicemia is unusual. Rarely, intravenous antibiotics may be \\nrequired.

After HSV infection, an eruption of multiple, \\npruritic, vesiculopustular lesions occurs in a disseminated \\npattern, both within plaques of atopic dermatitis and on \\nnormal-appearing skin. These characteristically rupture and \\nform crusted umbilicated papules and punched-out hemorrhagic \\nerosions (Fig. 190.3). Irritability, anorexia, and fever can also be \\nseen. Systemic and central nervous system disease have been \\nreported. Bacterial superinfection of eroded areas of the skin \\noften occurs. Diagnosis can be made rapidly from a scraping of \\nthe skin lesion stained with Giemsa or Wright’s stain (Tzanck \\ntest), although these are not highly sensitive. These stains allow \\nmicroscopic visualization of the presence of multinucleated \\ngiant cells indicative of HSV or varicella-zoster virus infection. \\nVesicle fluid can also be sent for polymerase chain reaction \\n(PCR) detection of HSV DNA, rapid direct fluorescent antibody \\ntesting, or viral culture.

Irritant \\ncontact dermatitis is observed after the skin surface is exposed \\nto an irritating chemical or substance. Contact dermatitis may \\noccur in any age, and girls are more frequently affected than \\nboys. Allergic contact dermatitis is a cell-mediated immune \\nreaction, also called type IV or delayed-type hypersensitivity. \\nThe antigens, or haptens, involved in allergic contact dermatitis \\nreadily penetrate the epidermis and are bound by Langerhans \\ncells, the antigen-presenting cells of the skin. The hapten is \\npresented to T lymphocytes and an immune cascade follows.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nIrritant contact dermatitis is characterized by ill-defined, scaly, \\npink or red patches and plaques (Fig. 191.1). The eruption is \\nlocalized to skin surfaces that are exposed to the irritant. Irritant \\ncontact dermatitis is observed frequently on the dorsal surfaces \\nof the hands in patients, often from repeated handwashing or \\nexposure to irritating chemicals.\\nDiaper dermatitis is a common problem in infants and most \\ncommonly is a form of irritant contact dermatitis. The dermatitis \\nis caused by irritation from urine and feces, typically affecting \\nthe perianal region and the buttocks while sparing the protected \\ngroin folds and other occluded areas. Secondary infection by \\nCandida albicans or bacterial pathogens may complicate diaper \\ndermatitis as well.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis may be acute (such as Rhus \\ndermatitis) or chronic (such as nickel dermatitis). Acute lesions \\nare bright pink, pruritic patches, often in linear or sharply \\nmarginated bizarre configurations. Within the patches are clear \\nvesicles and bullae (Fig. 191.2). Signs and symptoms of the \\ndisease may be delayed for 7-14 days after exposure if the patient \\nhas not been sensitized previously. On re-exposure, symptoms \\nbegin within hours and are usually more severe. The eruption \\nmay persist for weeks. Chronic lesions are pink, scaly, pruritic \\non participation in sports. Significant time, as well as financial \\nstrain, is involved in caring for a child with atopic dermatitis. \\nThus management should address these potential issues and \\nprovide adequate anticipatory guidance.\\nPROGNOSIS\\nAtopic dermatitis frequently remits during childhood and is \\nmuch less common after puberty. The condition is generally \\nmost severe and widespread in infancy and early child-\\nhood. Relapse of disease in adults can occur and commonly \\nmanifests as face or hand dermatitis. Frequently, adults have \\ngeneralized dry skin and are aware that their skin is sensitive \\nto many over-the-counter preparations. Patients with atopic \\ndermatitis can also develop asthma and allergic rhinitis. \\nAsthma is more commonly associated with more severe skin  \\ndisease.\\nPREVENTION\\nIndividual flares of atopic dermatitis can be prevented by \\navoiding triggers of inflammation and can be lessened with \\nfrequent moisturizer application. Evidence suggests that breast \\nfeeding for at least 4 months, with or without formula supple-\\nmentation, decreases the incidence and severity of atopic \\ndermatitis in individuals at high risk (i.e., those who have a \\nfirst-degree relative with atopic dermatitis). For infants at high \\nrisk who are not exclusively breast fed, there is modest evidence \\nthat the onset of atopic dermatitis may be delayed or prevented \\nby the use of extensively hydrolyzed casein-based formulas. \\nThere is no convincing evidence that an antigen avoidance diet \\nin pregnant or lactating mothers prevents the development of \\natopic disease. Early introduction of peanuts among children \\nat high risk for this allergy (i.e., infants with severe eczema, \\negg allergy, or both) significantly decreased the frequency of \\nthe development of peanut allergy in these infants in one large \\nrandomized study.\\nFIGURE 190.3 Eczema herpeticum (hand). \\nFIGURE 191.1 Irritant diaper dermatitis. \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Low-potency topical \\ncorticosteroids are frequently used in addition to topical \\nantifungal therapy to treat the irritant component of the diaper \\ndermatitis when present concomitantly.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nIn addition to superinfection of diaper dermatitis by C. albicans, \\nbacterial superinfection may complicate any form of contact \\ndermatitis. This is especially common if the skin barrier is no \\nlonger intact because of blistering or scratching.\\nPREVENTION\\nEvery effort should be made to identify the trigger of allergic \\nor irritant contact dermatitis. With allergic contact dermatitis, \\nre-exposure often leads to increasingly severe reactions.\\nCHAPTER 192 \\nSeborrheic Dermatitis\\nETIOLOGY\\nSeborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory \\ndisease that has different clinical presentations at different ages. \\nSeborrheic dermatitis classically presents in infants as cradle \\ncap or dermatitis in the intertriginous areas of the axillae, groin, \\nantecubital and popliteal fossae, and umbilicus. It is seen in \\nadolescents as dandruff. The pathogenesis of seborrheic der-\\nmatitis is unclear, but it is theorized that there is an abnormal \\ninflammatory response to commensal Malassezia species in \\nsebum-rich areas. Areas prone to seborrheic dermatitis include \\nthe scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, nasolabial folds, external auditory \\ncanals, and posterior auricular folds.\\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\\nSeborrheic dermatitis in infants begins during the first month \\nand persists during the first year of life. It is also called cradle \\ncap because of the thick, greasy and waxy, yellow-white scaling \\nand crusting of the scalp (Fig. 192.1). It is usually prominent \\non the vertex of the scalp, but it may be diffuse. Greasy, scaly, \\nerythematous, nonpruritic patches and plaques may extend \\nto the face and posterior auricular folds, sometimes involv-\\ning the entire body. Diaper and intertriginous areas can have \\nsharply demarcated, shiny, erythematous patches with minimal \\nscale. Hypopigmentation may persist after the inflammation \\nhas faded. The eruption is usually asymptomatic, which \\nhelps differentiate it from infantile atopic dermatitis, which  \\nis pruritic.\\nClassic seborrheic dermatitis during adolescence is typically \\nlocalized to the scalp. The mild form is commonly known as \\ndandruff, a fine, white, dry scaling of the scalp with minor \\nitching. Additional findings of seborrheic dermatitis vary from \\nplaques, often mimicking atopic dermatitis. Even intermittent \\nexposure can result in a persistent dermatitis.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nThe diagnosis is established by clinical presentation and history \\nof exposure to a recognized irritant or allergen. Skin-prick \\ntesting and serum IgE levels are not helpful in determining the \\ncause of allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing may be used \\nto determine the allergen causing the reaction in difficult cases.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe distribution and appearance of the dermatitis and a detailed \\nexposure history are the most useful diagnostic tools. Involve-\\nment of the lower legs and distal arms suggests exposure to \\nplants of the Rhus species (poison ivy or poison oak), especially \\nwhen linear configurations of lesions are present. Dermatitis \\nof the ears (earrings), wrist (bracelet or watch), or periumbilical \\nregion (belt buckle or pant buttons) suggests a metal allergy \\nto nickel. Distribution on the dorsal surfaces of the feet indicates \\na shoe allergy, usually to dyes, rubber, or leather. Topical \\nantibiotics (neomycin) and fragrances (soaps, perfumes, cosmet-\\nics) are frequent causes of allergic contact dermatitis.\\nDiaper rashes caused by Candida are quite common. Irritant \\ncontact dermatitis primarily affects the prominent, exposed \\nsurfaces, whereas Candida primarily affects intertriginous areas. \\nThe two are frequently present simultaneously, as secondary \\nCandida infection may complicate irritant dermatitis.\\nPsoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and Langerhans cell histio-\\ncytosis can present with an erythematous rash in the diaper \\narea. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered for any \\nchild with a severe rash or with a diaper rash that does not \\nrespond to conventional therapy.\\nTREATMENT\\nTopical corticosteroids are effective in treatment of allergic and \\nirritant contact dermatitis.

Seborrheic dermatitis does not cause permanent hair loss. \\nFor teenagers, continued use of an antiseborrheic shampoo is \\noften required for control of dandruff.\\nPREVENTION\\nFrequent shampooing, especially with early signs of seborrheic \\ndermatitis, may help prevent progression.\\nOTHER PAPULOSQUAMOUS DERMATOSES\\nPityriasis Rosea\\nPityriasis rosea is a benign, self-limited eruption that may \\noccur at any age, with peak incidence during adolescence. A \\nsolitary 2- to 5-cm, pink, oval patch with central clearing, the \\nso-called herald patch, is the first manifestation of the eruption. \\nThe herald patch typically is found on the trunk or proximal \\nthigh and is often misdiagnosed as fungal or eczematous in \\norigin. One to 2 weeks later, a generalized eruption occurs \\non the torso and proximal extremities. Multiple 0.5- to 2-cm, \\noval to oblong, red or tan macules with a fine, bran-like scale \\nare characteristically arranged parallel to skin tension lines \\n(Christmas-tree pattern). Rarely the eruption may have an \\ninverse distribution involving the axillae and groin or a papular \\nor papulovesicular appearance. Mild prodromal symptoms \\nmay be present with the appearance of the herald patch, and \\npruritus is present in 25% of cases. The eruption lasts 4-14 \\nweeks, with gradual resolution. Residual hyperpigmentation \\nor hypopigmentation can take additional months to clear. \\nTreatment is unnecessary, though pruritus can be managed \\nwith oral antihistamines, phototherapy, and low-potency topical  \\ncorticosteroids.\\nPsoriasis\\nPsoriasis is a common papulosquamous condition characterized \\nby well-demarcated, erythematous, scaling papules and plaques. \\nPsoriasis occurs at all ages, including infancy, with onset of \\n30% of cases during childhood. The disease is characterized \\nby a chronic and relapsing course, although spontaneous \\nremissions can occur. Infections (especially Streptococcus \\npyogenes), stress, trauma, and medications may cause disease \\nexacerbations. Various subtypes of psoriasis exist. The most \\ncommon variety is plaque-type psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), \\nwhich can be localized or generalized. The lesions consist of \\nround, well-demarcated, red plaques measuring 1- to 7-cm \\nwith micaceous scale, which is distinctive in its thick, silvery \\nappearance with pinpoint bleeding points revealed on removal \\nof the scales (Auspitz sign). The lesions of psoriasis have a \\ndiffuse, brawny scaling to focal areas of thick, oily, yellow \\ncrusts with underlying erythema. The external auditory canals, \\neyebrows, eyelids, and intertriginous areas may be involved as \\nwell. Pruritus may be minimal or severe.\\nLABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES\\nLaboratory studies and imaging studies are not necessary to \\ndiagnose seborrheic dermatitis. Fungal cultures and potassium \\nhydroxide studies may be necessary to help differentiate sebor-\\nrheic dermatitis of the scalp from tinea capitis (see Chapter \\n98).\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nSeborrheic dermatitis in an infant may be difficult to differentiate \\nfrom atopic dermatitis, and in fact, some cases may represent \\nan overlap. In a teenager, seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp \\nand psoriasis of the scalp may have very similar clinical find-\\nings; it may be very difficult to differentiate the two disorders, \\nespecially if there are no other cutaneous findings to provide \\nadditional clues. Intractable, severe, generalized seborrheic \\ndermatitis suggests Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Intractable \\nseborrheic dermatitis, accompanied by chronic diarrhea and \\nfailure to thrive, suggests erythroderma desquamativum \\n(Leiner disease) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  \\n(AIDS).\\nTREATMENT\\nSeborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is usually asymptomatic and \\ngenerally does not require treatment. Minor amounts of scale \\ncan be removed easily by frequent shampooing. For infants \\nwith cradle cap, oil (such as mineral oil or olive oil) may be \\ngently massaged into the scalp and left on for a few minutes \\nbefore gently brushing out the scale and shampooing. Daily \\nshampooing with ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, \\nor salicylic acid shampoos can treat scalp scale.

This is a congenital lesion caused \\nby entrapment of melanocytes in the dermis during their \\nmigration from the neural crest into the epidermis. Although \\nmost of these lesions are found in the lumbosacral area (Mon-\\ngolian spot), they also occur at other sites, such as the buttocks, \\nflank, extremities, or rarely, the face (Fig. 193.1). Single or \\nmultiple, poorly demarcated, gray-blue patches up to 10  cm \\nin size may be present. Most lesions gradually disappear during \\nthe first few years of life; aberrant lesions in unusual sites are \\nmore likely to persist.\\ndistinctive distribution involving the extensor aspect of the \\nelbows and knees, posterior occipital scalp, periumbilical region, \\nlumbosacral region, and intergluteal cleft. Children often have \\nfacial lesions involving the superomedial aspect of the eyelids. \\nNail plate involvement is common and includes pitting, ony-\\ncholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, and oil staining (reddish \\nbrown subungual macular discoloration). Guttate (numerous \\nsmall papules and plaques diffusely distributed on the torso), \\nerythrodermic (covering large body surface areas), inverse \\n(moist red patches affecting body folds), and pustular forms \\nmay occur.\\nThe foundation of therapy is topical corticosteroids. \\nTreatment of psoriasis with oral corticosteroids can induce \\npustular psoriasis and should be avoided. Because of the risk \\nof atrophy, striae, and telangiectases, especially when potent \\nfluorinated corticosteroid preparations are administered \\nlong term, the goal is to use the least potent corticosteroid \\nnecessary. Topical vitamin D analogs, salicylic acid, and tar \\npreparations are useful adjuvants to topical corticosteroids. \\nPhototherapy with ultraviolet B (UVB) light can be useful as \\nsecondary therapy in older children. Extensive plaque or guttate, \\nerythrodermic, and pustular psoriasis may necessitate systemic \\ntreatments with immune suppressive medication (methotrexate, \\ncyclosporine, tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists).

These lesions appear as color variegated, light \\nbrown to black patches or plaques, sometimes with smaller \\nmacules and papules (satellite nevi) in addition. The affected \\nskin may be smooth, nodular, or leathery. Prominent, dark \\nhypertrichosis is often present. Neuromelanosis, the pres-\\nence of melanocytes in the central nervous system, may be \\nassociated with giant congenital melanocytic nevi. Affected \\npatients may be asymptomatic or have hydrocephalus and \\nseizures; in symptomatic patients, death often results during \\nearly childhood. Malignant melanoma develops in approxi-\\nmately 2-10% of patients with giant congenital melanocytic \\nnevi, in either the cutaneous lesion or the neural melanocytes. \\nIn contrast to small and medium congenital melanocytic \\nnevi, melanoma is more likely to develop during childhood. \\nBecause of the incidence of malignant degeneration and \\nextensive deformity, surgical excision should be considered \\nfor resectable lesions. The use of tissue expansion techniques \\nhas greatly improved the capability for surgical removal of  \\nlarge lesions.\\nACQUIRED MELANOCYTIC NEVI\\nAcquired melanocytic nevi are common skin lesions. Melano-\\ncytic nevi may occur at any age; however, the lesions develop \\nmost rapidly in prepubertal children and teenagers. Melanocytic \\nnevi are well-delineated, round to oval, brown macules and \\npapules. Lesions are most common on the face, upper torso, \\nand arms. Family history, fair skin, and sun exposure are \\nconsidered major risk factors. Irregular pigmentation, rapid \\ngrowth, bleeding, and a change in configuration or borders \\nsuggest signs of malignant degeneration and biopsy should be \\nperformed. Malignant melanoma is rare in childhood; however, \\nthere is an alarming increase in incidence in adolescence, espe-\\ncially in those who use indoor tanning. Education of parents \\nand children regarding the risks of sun exposure, appropri-\\nate sun protection, and recognition of worrisome lesions is  \\nimportant.\\nCHAPTER 194 \\nVascular Anomalies\\nVascular anomalies can be divided into two major categories: \\ntumors and malformations. Vascular tumors are characterized \\nby hypercellularity, proliferation, and growth. Vascular mal-\\nformations, however, are developmental defects derived from \\nthe capillary, venous, arterial, or lymphatic vessels. In contrast \\nto hemangiomas, vascular malformations remain relatively static \\nand grow very slowly over time. Differentiating between these \\nentities is important because they have different prognoses and \\nclinical implications.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nNeck Masses\\nStridor\\nFIGURE 194.1 Hemangioma (chest). \\nInfantile hemangiomas are the most common soft tissue tumors \\nof infancy, occurring in approximately 5-10% of 1-year-old \\ninfants. In newborns, hemangiomas may originate as a pale \\nwhite macule with threadlike telangiectasia. When the tumor \\nproliferates, it assumes its most recognizable form as a bright \\nred, lobulated plaque or nodule (superficial type, Fig. 194.1). \\nHemangiomas that lie deeper in the skin are soft, warm masses \\nwith a blue discoloration (deeper type). Frequently, hemangio-\\nmas have both a superficial and a deep component (mixed \\ntype). They range from a few millimeters to several centimeters \\nin diameter and are usually solitary; 20% of affected children \\nhave multiple lesions. Hemangiomas occur predominantly in \\nfemales (3  :  1) a nd have an increased incidence in low birth \\nweight infants. Approximately 55% are present at birth; the \\nrest develop in the first weeks of life. Superficial hemangiomas \\nreach their maximal size by 6-8 months, but deep hemangiomas \\nmay grow for 12-14 months. They then undergo slow, spontane-\\nous resolution, which takes 3-10 years.\\nDespite the benign nature of most cutaneous hemangiomas, \\nthere may be the risk of functional compromise or permanent \\ndisfigurement, depending on the location and extent. Ulceration, \\nthe most frequent complication, can be painful and increases \\nthe risk of infection, hemorrhage, and scarring. Areas frequently \\nassociated with complications include the periocular region, \\nlip, nasal tip, beard, face (large lesions), groin, and buttocks.\\nPeriorbital hemangiomas pose considerable risk to vision \\nand should be monitored carefully. Amblyopia can result \\nfrom the hemangioma, causing obstruction of the visual axis \\nor pressure on the globe, resulting in astigmatism. If there \\nis any concern, the patient should have urgent evaluation by \\nan ophthalmologist. Treatment may be indicated to prevent \\nblindness. Subglottic hemangiomas manifest as hoarseness \\nand stridor; progression to respiratory failure may be rapid. \\nSymptomatic airway hemangiomas develop in more than 50% \\nof infants with extensive facial hemangiomas on the chin and \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Anticonvulsant therapy and \\nneurosurgical procedures have been of value in some patients. \\nGlaucoma can occur in association with port-wine stains located \\non the eyelid, even in the absence of Sturge-Weber syndrome, \\nand these patients need lifelong monitoring of ocular pressures. \\nKlippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome is characterized by the \\ntriad of capillary and venous malformations, venous varicosities, \\nand hyperplasia of the soft tissues—and often bone—of the \\ninvolved area. The lower limb is most commonly affected. A \\nport-wine stain overlying the spine may rarely be a marker of \\nspinal dysraphism or an intraspinal vascular malformation.\\nNevus Simplex\\nA nevus simplex (salmon patch, stork bite, angel’s kiss) is a \\nvascular birthmark that is present in 70% of normal new-\\nborns. They are red, irregular, macular patches resulting from \\ndilation of dermal capillaries and are usually found on the \\nnape of the neck, the eyelids, and the glabella. Most of the \\nfacial lesions fade by 1 year of age, but lesions on the neck \\nmay persist for life. Surveys of adult populations confirm the \\npersistence of the nuchal lesions in approximately 25% of the  \\npopulation.\\nCHAPTER 195 \\nErythema Multiforme, \\nStevens-Johnson Syndrome, \\nand Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis\\nErythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), \\nand toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are acute hypersensitivity \\nreactions characterized by cutaneous and mucosal necrosis. \\nThese syndromes represent a hypersensitivity reaction to a \\nprecipitating cause, usually infectious organisms or drugs. These \\ndisorders were historically thought to represent a spectrum of \\njaw (beard distribution); any infant with a beard hemangioma \\nshould be urgently referred for laryngoscopy. Multiple cutaneous \\n(diffuse hemangiomatosis) and large facial hemangiomas may be \\nassociated with visceral hemangiomas. Extensive cervicofacial \\nhemangiomas may be associated with multiple anomalies, \\nincluding posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial \\nanomalies of the cerebrovasculature, coarctation of aorta and \\ncardiac defects, and eye abnormalities (PHACE syndrome). \\nLumbosacral hemangiomas suggest an occult spinal dysraphism \\nwith or without anorectal and urogenital anomalies. Magnetic \\nresonance imaging of the spine is indicated in all patients with \\nlarge midline cutaneous hemangiomas in the lumbosacral area.\\nMost hemangiomas do not necessitate medical intervention \\nand involute spontaneously; however, if complications arise and \\ntreatment is warranted, oral propranolol or topical timolol are \\nthe mainstays of therapy.\\nPyogenic Granuloma\\nA pyogenic granuloma is an acquired, benign vascular tumor \\ncommonly seen in children. Initially, the lesions appear as \\npink-red papules that often arise after minor trauma, growing \\nrapidly over a period of weeks into a bright red, vascular, often \\npedunculated papule measuring 2-10  mm. Th e lesions often \\nhave the appearance of granulation tissue and are very friable. \\nThey may occur anywhere on the body, but the head, neck, \\nand upper extremities are most commonly affected. When \\ntraumatized, these lesions may bleed profusely, often requiring \\nemergent medical attention. Surgical excision is the most \\ndefinitive treatment option, although pulsed dye laser can be \\nuseful for very small lesions.\\nVASCULAR MALFORMATIONS\\nPort-Wine Stain\\nPort-wine stains (nevus flammeus, capillary malformation) are \\nmalformations of the superficial capillaries of the skin. These \\nlesions are present at birth and should be considered permanent \\ndevelopmental defects. They do not enlarge after birth; any \\napparent increase in size is caused by growth of the child. A \\nport-wine stain may be localized to any body surface, but facial \\nlesions are the most common. They are pink-red, sharply \\ndemarcated macules and patches in infancy (Fig. 194.2). With \\ntime, they darken to a purple or port-wine color and may develop \\na pebbly or slightly thickened surface. Vascular blebs may form \\nwithin the lesions and become symptomatic or bleed. The most \\nsuccessful treatment modality in use is the pulsed dye laser, \\nwhich can result in 80-90% improvement in these lesions after \\na series of treatment sessions and can avoid future complications \\nassociated with vascular dilation. Treatment is more effective \\nif undertaken in infancy. Overgrowth of underlying bone can \\noccur and is frequently seen with facial lesions. Affected patients \\noften need maxillofacial intervention from malalignment that \\ndevelops.\\nMost port-wine stains occur as isolated defects and do not \\nindicate systemic malformations. Rarely, they may suggest ocular \\ndefects or specific neurocutaneous syndromes. Sturge-Weber \\nsyndrome (encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis) may occur with \\na facial port-wine stain, usually in the cutaneous distribution \\nof the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. Other features \\ninclude leptomeningeal angiomatosis, mental retardation, \\nseizures, hemiparesis contralateral to the facial lesions, ipsilateral \\nintracortical calcification, and frequent ocular manifestations \\nFIGURE 194.2 Port-wine stain (face). \\nhttps://CafePezeshki.IR'),\n",

Patients with Kawasaki disease have \\nconjunctival injection and hyperemia of the mucous membranes. \\nNecrosis of the mucosal surfaces does not occur; blistering, \\nerosions, and severe crusting are not observed. The mucosal \\nchanges of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome are minor, \\nand frank erosions are not present. The blistering of the skin is \\nmore superficial and favors intertriginous regions. Mycoplasma \\npneumoniae may induce a SJS/TEN-like disorder that is newly \\nrecognized as a distinct disease called mycoplasma pneumonia-\\nassociated mucocutaneous disease.\\nSJS/TEN is a serious illness with a mortality rate as high as \\n35% for severe cases of TEN. Prompt discontinuation of the \\noffending agent is key. No controlled clinical trials regarding \\nmedical therapy exist, although early initiation of intravenous \\nimmunoglobulin has been proposed. Supportive care is another \\nessential component of therapy. A multidisciplinary care team \\nis often necessary. Sepsis is the major cause of morbidity and \\nmortality, so meticulous wound care is crucial, with stringent \\nsurveillance for cutaneous infections and use of antibiotics as \\nwarranted. Parenteral or nasogastric feeding should be instituted \\nearly to accelerate the healing process. Careful fluid management \\nand monitoring of electrolytes are critical. Ocular complica-\\ntions are a major cause of long-term morbidity, making early \\ninvolvement of an ophthalmologist important.\\nCHAPTER 196 \\nCutaneous Infestations\\nArthropods are common in the environment. Although many \\ncan bite or sting humans, only a few infest humans. Arachnids \\n(mites) are the most common, parasitizing humans and animals \\nby burrowing into the skin and depositing eggs within the skin.\\nSCABIES\\nERYTHEMA MULTIFORME\\nEM is a common, self-limiting, acute hypersensitivity syndrome \\ncharacterized by the abrupt onset of round, deep red, well-\\ndemarcated macules and papules with a dusky gray or bullous \\ncenter. The size may range from a few millimeters to a few \\ncentimeters, but most lesions are approximately 1  cm in \\ndiameter. The classic target lesion consists of three concentric \\nrings; the outermost is red, the intermediate is white, and the \\ncenter is a dusky red or purple. These can progress to edematous \\nplaques or bullae. If blistering occurs, it is circumscribed and \\ninvolves less than 10% of the body surface area. Cutaneous \\nlesions are symmetrically distributed and commonly involve \\nacral areas such as the hands, feet, elbows, and knees. Involve-\\nment of the ocular, oral, and genital mucosa can be seen in \\nsome cases.\\nMost EM cases in children are precipitated by herpes simplex \\nvirus infection, although the infection may no longer be apparent \\nby the time EM develops. Other infectious organisms may also \\ntrigger EM. Symptomatic treatment is usually sufficient. Oral \\nantihistamines help suppress pruritus, stinging, and burning. \\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids is controversial but may be \\nconsidered for severe mucosal disease. Antiviral medications \\ntargeting herpes simplex virus do not alter the course of the \\nEM, although children with recurrent EM may be candidates \\nfor prophylactic antivirals. The prognosis is excellent, with \\nmost lesions lasting no more than 2 weeks. Healing occurs \\nwithout scarring.\\nSTEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME AND TOXIC \\nEPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS\\nSJS, TEN, and SJS/TEN overlap are severe, life-threatening \\ndisorders thought to represent the same disease continuum. \\nThey are usually preceded by a prodrome of fever, malaise, and \\nupper respiratory symptoms 1-14 days before the onset of \\ncutaneous lesions. Red macules appear suddenly and tend to \\ncoalesce into large patches, with a predominant distribution \\nover the face and trunk. Atypical targets may be present, causing \\ndiagnostic confusion initially with EM, although the atypical \\ntargets lack the characteristic three zones. Skin lesions evolve \\nrapidly into bullae and areas of necrosis. SJS is defined as \\nepidermal detachment of less than 10% of the body surface \\narea, whereas SJS/TEN overlap has 10-30% and TEN has greater \\nthan 30% body surface area involvement. Any mucosal surface \\nmay be involved. The upper and lower lips are generally swollen \\nand bright red with erosions and hemorrhagic crusts. The \\nremainder of the oral mucosa may also be involved. Early in \\nthe disease process, there is bilateral conjunctival injection; \\nthis usually progresses to conjunctival erosions. There may be \\nerosions of the penile, vaginal, or perianal mucosa. Urogenital, \\nesophageal, and tracheal surfaces may be involved in the most \\nsevere cases.\\nDrugs are the most common causes of SJS/TEN in chil -\\ndren. The most common drugs implicated are nonsteroidal \\nantiinflammatory drugs, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, and \\nantibiotics. Other precipitating factors are viral infections, \\nbacterial infections, syphilis, and deep fungal infections.\\nSJS/TEN can occur at any age. The diagnosis of SJS/TEN \\nis clinical; there are no diagnostic tests.

The bite causes small urticarial \\npapules and itching. Head lice live close to the skin and may \\nlive for 30 days, depositing 100-400 eggs as nits on hair shafts, \\nusually within 6 mm of the scalp.\\nHead lice are seen most frequently in early school-age \\nchildren. Head lice infestations are unrelated to hygiene and \\nare not more common among children with long hair or with \\ndirty hair. It is estimated that 6-12 million persons in the \\nUnited States and 1-3% of persons in developed countries are \\ninfested with head lice each year. In the United States, head \\nlice infestation is rare among African Americans and may be \\nmore common in girls, which is attributed to their tendency \\nto play more closely with one another than boys do.\\nPubic lice are transmitted by sexual contact. Their presence \\nin children may be a sign of child abuse. Body lice are firm \\nevidence of poor hygiene, such as infrequent washing and \\nclothing changes.\\nItching, if present, is the primary symptom. Pediculosis \\ncapitis usually causes pruritus behind the ears or on the nape \\nof the neck, or a crawling sensation in the scalp. Pediculosis \\npubis usually causes pruritus in the groin. Eyelash involvement \\nin children may cause crusting and blepharitis. Pediculosis \\ncorporis causes pruritus that, because of repeated scratching, \\nmay result in lichenification or secondary bacterial infection. \\nExcoriations and crusting, with or without associated regional \\nlymphadenopathy, may be present.\\nInfestation with the head louse may be asymptomatic and has \\nlittle morbidity. The diagnosis can be confirmed by visualizing \\na live louse. A fine-toothed comb to trap lice is more effective \\nthan simply looking at the hair. Wet combing is more time-\\nconsuming, but dry combing produces static that may propel \\nthe lice away from the comb.\\nNits represent the outer casing of the louse ova. Viable nits \\nhave an intact operculum (cap) on the nonattached end and \\na developing louse within the egg. Brown nits located on the \\nproximal hair shaft suggest active infestation. White nits located \\non the hair shaft 4 cm or farther from the scalp indicate previous \\ninfestation. Because nonviable nits can remain stuck in the hair \\nfor weeks to months after an infestation has resolved, many \\nchildren with nits do not have active lice infestation.\\nThe treatment of head lice is controversial because of \\nresistance to many established options. Permethrin (1%) \\nand pyrethrin-based products (0.17-0.33%) (pyrethroids) are \\nover-the-counter options. Because 20-30% of eggs may survive \\none treatment, a second treatment should be applied in 9-10 \\ndays. Drug resistance to pyrethroids is on the rise. Malathion \\n(0.5%) lotion, benzyl alcohol (5%) lotion, spinosad (0.9%) \\ntopical suspension, and ivermectin (0.5%) lotion may be used \\nas alternatives for resistant cases.\\nEveryone in the family should be checked for head lice and \\ntreated if live lice are found to reduce the risk of reinfestation. \\nBed linens, towels, and clothes worn for the previous 2 days \\nbefore treatment should be machine-washed in hot water and \\nmachine-dried using high heat. Items that are not washable \\nmay be dry-cleaned or placed in a sealed plastic bag for 2 \\nweeks. Brushes and combs should be soaked in dish detergent \\nor rubbing alcohol for 1 hour. Rugs, furniture, mattresses, and \\ncar seats should be vacuumed thoroughly.\\nscabies have diffuse erythema, scaling, and pinpoint papules. \\nPustules, vesicles, and nodules are much more common in \\ninfants and may be more diffusely distributed. The face and scalp \\nusually are spared in adults and older children, but these areas \\nare usually involved in infants. Nodular lesions may represent \\nactive infection or prolonged hypersensitivity lesions following \\nresolution of infestation. Immunocompromised or neurologically \\nimpaired persons may develop a severe form of the disease \\nknown as Norwegian or crusted scabies, with infestation of \\n2 million live mites at one time.\\nThe diagnosis of scabies can be confirmed by microscopic \\nvisualization of the mite, eggs, larvae, or feces in scrapings \\nof papules or burrows examined under oil immersion. Skin \\nbiopsy is rarely necessary but may be useful if lesions have \\nbecome nodular.\\nCurative treatment is achieved by a 12-hour (overnight) \\napplication of permethrin 5% cream applied to the entire body. \\nBecause permethrin is not effective against the eggs, the treat-\\nment should be repeated 1 week later to kill any subsequently \\nhatched larvae. All household members and close contacts \\nshould be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic. Bed \\nlinens, towels, and clothes worn for the previous 2 days before \\ntreatment should be machine-washed in hot water and machine-\\ndried using high heat; heat is the most effective scabicide. Items \\nthat are not washable may be dry-cleaned or placed in a sealed \\nplastic bag for 7 days.\\nSecondary bacterial infection may occur but is uncom -\\nmon. In contrast to the pediculoses, scabies is not a vector for \\ninfections. Pruritus may persist for 7-14 days after successful \\ntherapy because of a prolonged hypersensitivity reaction, which \\ndoes not indicate treatment failure. Inadequate treatment or \\nreinfestation should be suspected if new lesions develop after  \\ntreatment.\\nPEDICULOSES\\nThree species of lice infest humans: Pediculus humanus capitis, \\nthe head louse; Pthirus pubis, the pubic louse or crab louse; \\nand Pediculus humanus humanus  (also known as Pediculus \\nhumanus corporis), the body louse .

The \\nnewborn’s hips are externally rotated. Pes planus and genu \\nvarum are common. Infants are usually born with a flexed \\nposture, which usually decreases to neutral within the first 4-6 \\nmonths.

The \\nanatomical, biomechanical, and physiological differences in \\nchildren account for unique fracture patterns and management. \\nFracture terminology helps describe fractures (Table 198.1).\\nThe pediatric skeleton has a higher proportion of cartilage \\nand a thicker, stronger, and more active periosteum capable of \\nproducing a larger callus more rapidly than in an adult. The \\nthick periosteum may decrease the rate of displaced fractures \\nand stabilize fractures after reduction. Because of the higher \\nproportion of cartilage, the skeletally immature patient can \\nwithstand more force before deformation or fracture than adult \\nbone. As children mature into adolescence, the rate of healing \\nslows and approaches that of adults.\\nPEDIATRIC FRACTURE PATTERNS\\nBuckle or torus fractures occur after compression of the bone; \\nthe bony cortex does not truly break. These fractures will \\ntypically occur in the metaphysis and are stable fractures that \\nheal in approximately 4 weeks with immobilization. A common \\nexample is a fall onto an outstretched arm causing a buckle \\nfracture in the distal radius.\\nComplete fractures occur when both sides of bony cortex \\nare fractured. This is the most common fracture and may be \\nclassified as comminuted, oblique, transverse, or spiral, depend-\\ning on the direction of the fracture line.\\nGreenstick fractures occur when a bone is angulated beyond \\nthe limits of plastic deformation. The bone fails on the tension \\nside and sustains a bend deformity on the compression side. The \\nforce is insufficient to cause a complete fracture (Fig. 198.1).\\nBowing fractures demonstrate no fracture line evident on \\nradiographs, but the bone is bent beyond its limit of plastic \\ndeformation. This is not a true fracture but will heal with \\nperiosteal reaction.\\nTABLE 198.1 Useful Fracture Terminology\\nComplete The bone fragments separate completely\\nIncomplete The bone fragments are still partially joined\\nLinear Referring to a fracture line that is parallel to the \\nbone’s long axis\\nTransverse Referring to a fracture line that is at a right \\nangle to the bone’s long axis\\nOblique Referring to a fracture line that is diagonal to \\nthe bone’s long axis\\nSpiral Referring to a twisting fracture\\nComminution A fracture that results in several fragments\\nCompaction The bone fragments are driven into each other\\nAngulation The fragments have angular malalignment\\nRotation The fragments have rotational malalignment\\nShortening The fractured ends of the bones overlap\\nOpen A fracture in which the bone has pierced the \\nskin\\nFIGURE 198.1  The greenstick fracture is an incomplete fracture. \\n(Modified from White N, Sty R.

These fractures \\nare more common in males (2 :  1 m ale-female ratio). The peak \\nincidence is 13-14 years in boys and 11-12 years in girls. The \\ndistal radius, distal tibia, and distal fibula are the most common \\nlocations.\\nLigaments frequently insert onto epiphyses. Thus traumatic \\nforces to an extremity may be transmitted to the physis, which \\nis not as biomechanically strong as the metaphysis; it may \\nfracture with mechanisms of injury that may cause sprains \\nin the adult. The growth plate is most susceptible to torsional \\nand angular forces.\\nPhyseal fractures are described using Salter-Harris clas-\\nsification, which allows for prognostic information regarding \\npremature closure of the growth plate and poor functional \\noutcomes.

Femoral fractures \\nin children younger than 10 years of age will frequently overgrow \\n1-3 cm. This is the reason end-to-end alignment for femur and \\nlong-bone fractures may not be indicated. After 10 years of \\nage, overgrowth is less of a problem, so end-to-end alignment \\nis recommended.\\nProgressive Deformity\\nFractures and injuries to the physis can result in premature \\nclosure. If it is a partial closure, the consequence may be an \\nangular deformity. If it is a complete closure, limb shortening \\nmay occur. The most commonly affected locations are the distal \\nfemur and the distal and proximal tibia.\\nNeurovascular Injury\\nFractures and dislocations may damage adjacent blood vessels \\nand nerves. The most common location is the distal humerus \\n(supracondylar fracture) and the knee (dislocation and physeal \\nfracture). It is necessary to perform and document a careful \\nneurovascular examination distal to the fracture (pulse, sensory, \\nand motor function).\\nCompartment Syndrome\\nCompartment syndrome is an orthopedic emergency  that \\nresults from hemorrhage and soft tissue swelling within the \\ntight fascial compartments of an extremity. This can result in \\nmuscle ischemia and neurovascular compromise unless it is \\nsurgically decompressed. The most common sites are the lower \\nleg (tibial fracture) and arm (supracondylar fracture).\\nAffected patients have severe pain and will eventually have \\ndecreased sensation in the dermatomes supplied by the nerves \\nlocated in the compartment. Swollen and tight compartments \\nand pain with passive stretching are present. This can happen \\nunderneath a cast and may actually occur when a cast is applied \\nTypes I and II fractures can often be managed by closed \\nreduction and do not require perfect alignment. A major \\nexception is the type II fracture of the distal femur, which is \\nassociated with a poor outcome unless proper anatomical align-\\nment\\tis\\tobtained.\\tTypes\\tIII\\tand\\tIV\\tfractures\\trequire\\tanatomical\\t\\nalignment\\tfor\\tsuccessful\\ttreatment.\\tType\\tV\\tfractures\\tare\\trare\\t\\nand often result in premature closure of the physis.\\nMANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC FRACTURES\\nThe majority of pediatric fractures can be managed with closed \\nmethods. Some fractures need closed reduction to improve \\nalignment. Approximately 4% of pediatric fractures require \\ninternal fixation. Patients with open physes are more likely to \\nrequire internal fixation if they have one of the following \\nfractures:\\n•\\t Displaced\\tepiphyseal\\tfractures\\n•\\t Displaced\\tintraarticular\\tfractures\\n•\\t Fractures\\tin\\ta\\tchild\\twith\\tmultiple\\tinjuries\\n•\\t Open\\tfractures\\n•\\t Unstable\\tfractures\\nThe goal of internal fixation is to improve and maintain \\nanatomical alignment. This is usually done with Kirschner \\nwires, Steinmann pins, and cortical screws with subsequent \\nexternal immobilization in a cast until healing is satisfactory. \\nAfter healing, the hardware is frequently removed to prevent \\nincorporation into the callus and prevent physeal damage.\\nExternal fixation without casting may be necessary for pelvic \\nfractures causing hemodynamic instability. Fractures associated \\nwith soft tissue loss, burns, and neurovascular damage may \\nbenefit from external fixation.\\nSPECIAL CONCERNS\\nRemodeling\\nFracture remodeling occurs because of a combination of \\nperiosteal resorption and new bone formation. Many pediatric \\nfractures do not need perfect anatomical alignment for proper \\nhealing. Y ounger patients have greater potential for fracture \\nremodeling. Fractures that occur in the metaphysis, near the \\ngrowth plate, may undergo more remodeling. Fractures angu-\\nlated in the plane of motion also remodel very well.

There are two types of DDH: \\nteratological and typical. Teratological dislocations occur early \\nin utero and are usually associated with neuromuscular disorders \\n(spina bifida, arthrogryposis). Typical dislocations occur in \\nthe neurologically normal infant and can occur before or after \\nbirth. The true incidence of DDH is unknown, but it may be \\nas high as 1.5 cases per 1,000 infants.\\nEtiology\\nNewborn infants have ligamentous laxity that, if significant \\nenough in the hip, may lead to spontaneous dislocation and \\nreduction of the femoral head. Persistence of this spontaneous \\npattern can lead to pathological changes, such as flattening of \\nthe acetabulum, muscle contractures that limit motion, and \\njoint capsule tightening. The left hip is affected three times as \\noften as the right hip, possibly because of in utero positioning.\\nPhysiological risk factors for DDH include a generalized \\nligamentous laxity, perhaps from maternal hormones that are \\nassociated with pelvic ligament relaxation (estrogen and relaxin). \\nFemale infants are at higher risk (9 :  1); fa mily history is positive \\nin 20% of all patients with DDH.\\nOther risk factors include breech presentation, firstborn child \\n(60%), oligohydramnios, and postnatal infant positioning. In \\nbreech presentations, the fetal pelvis is situated in the maternal \\npelvis. This can increase hip flexion and limit overall fetal hip \\nmotion, causing further stretching of the already lax joint capsule \\nand exposing the posterior aspect of the femoral head. The \\naltered relationship between the acetabulum and femoral head \\ncauses abnormal acetabular development. Postnatal position-\\ning of the hips in a tight swaddle with the hips adducted and \\nextended can displace the hip joint.\\nCongenital muscular torticollis, metatarsus adductus, and \\nclubfoot are associated with DDH. An infant with any of these \\nthree conditions should receive a careful examination of the hips.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nEvery newborn requires a screening physical examination for \\nDDH; further evaluation through at least the first 18 months \\nof life is part of the physical examination for toddlers. DDH \\nevolves over time, so the examination may change as the patient \\nages. The examination starts with inspection for asymmetrical \\nthigh and gluteal folds with the hips and knees flexed. A relative \\nshortening of the femur with asymmetrical skin folds is a positive \\nGaleazzi sign and indicates DDH. Range of motion should be \\nassessed with the pelvis stabilized and the child supine on the \\nexamining table, not in the parent’s lap (Fig. 199.1). Hip abduc-\\ntion should easily reach or exceed 75 degrees, and hip adduction \\nshould reach 30 degrees. Limitations may indicate contractures \\nassociated with DDH, especially decreased abduction.\\nThe Barlow test attempts to dislocate an unstable hip (Fig. \\n199.2). The examiner should stabilize the infant’s pelvis with \\none hand and grasp the abducted and flexed thigh in the other \\nhand. The hip should be flexed to 90 degrees. Next, begin to \\nadduct the hip while applying a posterior force to the anterior \\nhip. A hip that can be dislocated in this method is readily felt \\n(clunk feeling) and is a positive test. It may reduce spontaneously \\nonce the posterior force is removed, or the examiner may need \\nto perform the Ortolani test.\\nThe Ortolani test may reduce a dislocated hip (Fig. 199.3). \\nThe examiner should stabilize the pelvis and hold the leg in the \\ntoo tightly. It is important to educate all patients with fractures \\non the signs of compartment syndrome and ensure that they \\nrealize it is an emergency.\\nToddler’s Fracture\\nThis is an oblique fracture of the distal tibia without a fibula \\nfracture. There is often no significant trauma. Patients are usually \\n1-3 years old but can be as old as 6 and present with limping \\nand pain with weight bearing. There may be minimal swelling \\nand pain. Initial radiographs do not always show the fracture; \\nif symptoms persist, a repeat x-ray in 7-10 days may be helpful.\\nChild Abuse\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nExtremity Pain\\nChild abuse must always be considered in the differential \\ndiagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger \\nthan 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that \\nshould increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures \\nin different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner \\nfractures (twisting and shaking), fractures too severe for the \\nhistory, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral \\nfractures of long bones were historically considered pathog-\\nnomonic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.\\nWhen there is concern for child abuse, the child should \\nhave a full evaluation, which may include admission to the \\nhospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examina-\\ntion should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a \\nfunduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. \\nA skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying \\nother fractures.\\nCHAPTER 199 \\nHip\\nThe hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint \\nthat is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and \\nacetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and develop-\\nment. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital \\nfemoral epiphysis, are intraarticular. The blood supply to this \\nregion is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous \\nand lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis \\nperipherally. Thus the blood supply to the femoral head is \\nvulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may \\nincrease intraarticular pressure. Damage to the blood supply \\ncan lead to avascular necrosis.\\nDEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP\\nIn developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the hips may be \\ndislocated or dislocatable at birth.

The infant’s hip should be \\nin 90 degrees of flexion. Abduct the hip while applying anterior \\npressure to the posterior thigh. A positive test is the palpable \\nreduction of the dislocation, which may be felt (clunk). After \\n2 months of age, the hip may develop muscular contractures, \\npreventing positive Ortolani tests.\\nThese tests should be performed with only gentle force and \\ndone one hip at a time. The test may need to be repeated multiple \\ntimes, as they can be difficult to interpret. A click, which is not \\npathological, may occur from breaking the surface tension of \\nthe hip joint or snapping gluteal tendons.\\nBilateral fixed dislocations present a diagnostic dilemma \\nbecause of the symmetry on exam. The Klisic test  is useful \\nin this situation; it is done by placing the third finger over \\nthe greater trochanter and the index finger over the anterior \\nsuperior iliac spine, then drawing an imaginary line between \\nthe two. The line should point to the umbilicus in a normal \\nchild. However, in a dislocated hip, the greater trochanter is \\nelevated, which causes the line to project lower (between the \\numbilicus and pubis). This test is helpful in identifying bilateral \\nDDH, which can otherwise be difficult to diagnose because of \\nthe symmetry found on examination.\\nOlder children with unrecognized DDH may present with \\nlimping. A patient with increased lumbar lordosis and a waddling \\ngait may have an unrecognized bilateral DDH.\\nRadiographic Evaluation\\nUltrasound\\tis\\tused\\tfor\\tinitial\\tevaluation\\tof\\tinfants\\twith\\tDDH.\\t\\nUltrasonography\\tis\\tnecessary\\tfor\\tgirls\\twith\\ta\\tpositive\\tfamily\\t\\nhistory or breech presentation in both sexes. This should be \\nobtained after 6 weeks of age to avoid confusion with physiologi-\\ncal laxity. Because the femoral head begins to ossify at 4-6 \\nmonths of age, plain radiographs can be misleading until patients \\nare older.\\nABDUCTION TEST\\nNormal at birth to 1 mo of age Often normal, 1-9 mo of age\\nSuspected significant limitation Definite limitation\\n(1) (2)\\n(3) (4)\\n90 70\\n60 50\\nFIGURE 199.1 Hip abduction test.

Irritation of the obturator \\nnerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the \\npathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are \\noften afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to \\nminimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, \\nand erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial \\ndiseases of the hip (Table 199.1). Table 197.3 lists the differential \\ndiagnosis of a limping child.\\nAnteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are \\nusually\\tn ormal. \\tU ltrasonography \\tm ay \\tr eveal \\ta \\tj oint \\teff usion. \\t\\nIt is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of \\neffusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.\\nTreatment\\nThe mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight \\nbearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory \\nmedication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting \\nstrenuous activity and exercise for 1-2 weeks following recovery \\nis helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deteriora-\\ntion. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for \\nmore serious disorders.\\nLEGG-CALVE-PERTHES DISEASE\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of DDH is individualized and depends on the \\nchild’s age at diagnosis. The goal of treatment is a stable reduction \\nthat results in normal growth and development of the hip. If \\nDDH is suspected, the child should be sent to a pediatric \\northopedic specialist.\\nThe Pavlik harness is an effective treatment up to 6 months \\nof age. It provides hip flexion to just over 90 degrees and limits \\nadduction to no more than neutral. This positioning redirects \\nthe femoral head toward the acetabulum. The hip must be \\nreduced within 1-2 weeks of beginning the Pavlik harness, \\nalthough the infant will need more time in the device. The \\nPavlik harness is successful in treating approximately 95% of \\ndysplastic or subluxated hips, and 80% successful for treatment \\nof true dislocations. Persistently dislocated hips should not \\nremain in a Pavlik harness for more than 2 weeks for fear of \\niatrogenic acetabular damage. Patients failing the Pavlik harness \\nwarrant treatment with an abduction orthosis.\\nChildren over 6 months or those who have failed nonopera-\\ntive treatment should undergo closed reduction using a hip \\nspica cast. This is done under general anesthesia; reduction is \\nevaluated with an intraoperative arthrogram then confirmed \\nby postoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic \\nresonance imaging (MRI). If closed reduction fails, open \\nreduction is indicated. Patients over 18 months of age may \\nrequire a pelvic and femoral osteotomy.\\nComplications\\nThe most important and severe complication of DDH is iat-\\nrogenic avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This can occur \\nfrom excessive flexion or abduction during positioning of the \\nPavlik harness or hip spica cast. Infants under 6 months of age \\nare at highest risk. Pressure ulcers can occur with prolonged \\ncasting. Redislocation or subluxation of the femoral head and \\nresidual acetabular dysplasia can occur.\\nTRANSIENT MONOARTICULAR SYNOVITIS\\n Decision-Making Algorithm\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLimp\\nTABLE 199.1 Differences Between Bacterial Infection \\nand Transient Synovitis\\nBACTERIAL INFECTION* TRANSIENT SYNOVITIS\\nElevated joint fluid cell count\\nFever—temperature >38.5°C\\nAfebrile\\nLeukocytosis Normal WBC count\\nESR >20 mm/hr Normal ESR and CRP\\nRefusal to walk Painful limp\\nHip held in external rotation, \\nabduction, and flexion\\nHip held normally\\nSevere pain and tenderness Moderate pain and mild \\ntenderness\\n*Examples: Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis of hip.\\nCRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; WBC, white blood \\ncell.\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLimp\\nExtremity Pain\\nTransient synovitis, also known as toxic synovitis, is a common \\ncause of limping in children. It is a diagnosis of exclusion because \\nseptic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the hip must be excluded \\n(see Chapters 117 and 118).\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nThe etiology of transient synovitis is uncertain, but possible \\ncauses are viral illness and hypersensitivity. Approximately 70% \\nof children diagnosed with transient synovitis have an upper \\nrespiratory tract viral infection in the preceding 7-14 days. \\nBiopsies have revealed nonspecific synovial hypertrophy.

Additional risk factors \\nfor SCFE include obesity, trisomy 21, and endocrine disorders \\n(hypothyroid, pituitary tumor, growth hormone deficiency).\\nClassification\\nSCFE\\tis\\tclassified\\tas\\tstable\\tor\\tunstable.\\tUnstable\\tpatients\\trefuse\\t\\nto ambulate even with crutches. Stable patients have an antalgic \\ngait. SCFE can also be characterized as acute (symptoms <3 \\nweeks) or chronic (symptoms >3 weeks). Acute-on-chronic \\nSCFE is seen when more than 3 weeks of symptoms are \\naccompanied by an acute exacerbation of pain and difficulty/\\ninability to bear weight.\\nClinical Manifestation\\nThe presentation is variable, based on severity and type of slip. \\nPatients will often report hip or knee pain, limp or inability to \\nambulate, and decreased hip range of motion. There may or \\nmay not be a traumatic event. Any knee pain mandates an \\nexamination of the hip, as hip pathology can cause referred pain \\nto the anterior thigh and knee along the obturator nerve. The \\npatient usually holds the affected extremity in external rotation. \\nAs the hip is flexed, it will progressively externally rotate. There \\nis usually a limitation of internal rotation, but there may also \\nbe a loss of flexion and abduction. If the patient can bear weight, \\nit is typically an antalgic gait with the affected leg in external \\nrotation. It is important to examine both hips to determine \\nbilateral involvement.\\nRadiological Evaluation\\nAnteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs are indicated. Patients \\nwith known SCFE or with a high index of suspicion should \\nnot undergo frog-leg lateral radiographs. Instead, a cross table \\nlateral radiograph reduces the risk of iatrogenic progression. \\nThe earliest sign of SCFE is widening of the physis without \\nslippage (preslip condition). Klein’s line (Fig. 199.4) is helpful in \\nassessing the anteroposterior radiograph for SCFE. The slippage \\ncan be classified radiographically as type I (0-33% displace-\\nment), type II (34-50%), or type III (>50%). The likelihood of \\ncomplications increases with degree of displacement.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with SCFE should be immediately made non–weight \\nbearing and referred to a pediatric orthopedist. The goal is to \\nprevent further slippage, enhance physeal closure, and minimize \\ncomplications, which is usually accomplished with internal \\nfixation in situ with a single cannulated screw. More severe \\ncases may require surgical hip dislocation and reduction to \\nrealign the epiphysis. There is controversy surrounding the \\nprophylactic fixation of the nonaffected side. Assessment for \\nendocrine disorders is important, particularly in children outside \\nthe range of 10-16 years of age.\\nComplications\\nThe two most serious complications of SCFE are chondrolysis \\nand avascular necrosis. Chondrolysis is destruction of the \\narticular cartilage. It is associated with more severe slips and \\nwith intraarticular penetration of operative hardware. This can \\nLCPD commonly presents in patients 3-12 years of age, with \\na mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common \\nin boys.\\nClinical Manifestations\\nPatients may not present for several weeks because of minimal \\ndiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, \\npainless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, \\nanterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotation and \\nabduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, and \\nanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients have \\ndelayed bone age.\\nRadiological Evaluation\\nAnteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of both hips are usually \\nadequate for diagnosis and management. It is necessary to \\ndocument the extent of the disease and follow its progression. \\nMRI and bone scan are helpful to diagnose early LCPD.\\nTreatment and Prognosis\\nLCPD is usually a self-limited disorder that should be followed \\nby a pediatric orthopedist. Initial treatment focuses on pain \\ncontrol and restoration of hip range of motion. The goal of \\ntreatment is prevention of complications, such as femoral head \\ndeformity and secondary osteoarthritis (OA).\\nContainment is important in treating LCPD; the femoral \\nhead is contained inside the acetabulum, which acts like a mold \\nfor the capital femoral epiphysis as it reossifies. Nonsurgical \\ncontainment uses abduction casts and orthoses, whereas surgical \\ncontainment is accomplished with osteotomies of the proximal \\nfemur and pelvis.\\nThe short-term prognosis is determined by the magnitude \\nof the femoral head deformity after healing has completed. It is \\nimproved by early diagnosis, good follow-up, and compliance \\nwith the treatment plan. Older children and children with a \\nresidual femoral head deformity are more likely to develop OA. \\nThe incidence of OA in patients who developed LCPD after 10 \\nyears of age is close to 100%; it is negligible in children with \\nonset before 5 years of age. Patients between 6 and 9 years of \\nage have a risk of OA of less than 40%.\\nSLIPPED CAPITAL FEMORAL EPIPHYSIS\\n Decision-Making Algorithms\\nAvailable @ StudentConsult.com\\nLimp\\nExtremity Pain\\nEtiology and Epidemiology\\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is an adolescent hip \\ndisorder that is an orthopedic emergency. The incidence is 10.8 \\nper 100,000, and it is slightly higher in males. African-American \\nand Hispanic populations are at higher risk. Approximately \\n20% of patients with SCFE will have bilateral involvement at \\npresentation, and another 20-40% may progress to bilateral \\ninvolvement.
